Discovery of Association Rules in Metabolic Syndrome Related Diseases Chien-Lung Chan Chien-Wei Chen Baw-Jhiune Liu Abstract Since 1980 the Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus in Metabolic Syndrome have appeared in the top ten causes of death every year in Taiwan This research aims to study Metabolic Syndrome related disease by using data mining technique and to understand the strength of association between Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia The data of this research came from the National Health Insurance Research Database provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance Department of Health It includes the Diabete s Mellitus patients health insurance record during 2003-2005 in Taiwan We used 
association rules to find diseases patterns of Metabolic Syndrome related disease Using data mining technique can find and confirm the relation between diseases We found Diabetes Mellitus is related to oral diseases and blear eyes We also found that patients with Metabolic Syndrome have higher connection with liver diseases than patients with Diabetes Mellitus Keyword Association Rules Metabolic Syndrome I INTRODUCTION The whole National Health Insurance Research Database is a goldmine with tons of undiscovered knowledge and information Gillespic 1 p r o p osed to f i nd important relation in diseases is helpful in constructing diagnose guideline and preventing of diseases Owing to 
the sedentary life style and the lack of the exercise there exist many diseases related to bad metabolism 2  I n 1998 Reaven gave the concept of Metabolic Syndrome which includes five symptoms they are Abdominal obesity excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen Atherogenic dyslipidemia blood fat disorders  high triglycerides low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol  that foster plaque buildups in artery walls Elevated blood pressure Insulin resistance or glucose intolerance the body canêt properly use insulin or blood sugar Prothrombotic state e.g high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitorÖ1 in the blood 
Proinflammatory state e.g elevated C-reactive protein in the blood The most related diseases are Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus These two diseases in the past twenty years are listed on the Top Ten Causes of Death in Manuscript received November 30 2007 This work was supported by National Science Council Taivan Project NSC 94-2745-E-155-009-URD C L Chan is with Department of Information Management Yuan Ze University Chung-Li Taiwan 320 R.O.C e-mail clchan@saturn.yzu.edu.tw C W Chen is with Department of Information Management Yuan Ze University Chung-Li Taiwan 320 R.O.C B J Liu is with Department of Computer Science  Engineering

The number of times that diabetes and heart disease are diagnosed at the same time is up to 49,020. In addition, every hundred patients have 2 diagnosed heart diseases. Metabolic Syndrome Patients need care about the high risk of getting cardiovascular disease. In addition, there also have the diagnose relation similar with the Diabetes patients. Among the three major diseases of Metabolic Syndrome, there is more records related with Mixed hyperlipidemia and Diabetes with neurological manifestations, then is Diabetes with renal manifestations and Diabetes mellitus without mention of complication. The frequency can also be a guide. when diagnose, and to know the relation between specific diabetes and hyperlipidemia 4 Data mining on Metabolic Syndrome On the association rules of Apriori, the disease has a lot of repetitiveness with the diabetes patients. The main factor of Metabolic Syndrome is type two Diabetes, so the relevant disease that the diabetes causes - oral diseases blear and kidney failure all need to pay extra attention The other special association ones are described as following Contact dermatitis and other eczema In the results, Contact dermatitis and other eczema 6929\have the highest support and confidence.

and other eczema is the skin that contacts materials and causes the inflammation of producing and irritated phenomenon. As long as find out the source and avoid the pathogenically, belong to Contact Dermatitis, not the complication of the nonspecific chronic disease Urinary system In the urinary system, male have the diagnosis on disease about Hypertrophy \(benign\ of prostate, and the whole group have the diseases connected with urinary infection. Table 6 shows the data and ICD-9 in detail There is no relevant research probe into the disease of urinary system to Metabolic Syndrome. But in type II Diabetes, Holland scholar, Meller proved Diabetes as a dangerous factor infected the urinary system in the way of linear regression. The result confirmed that the type II Diabetes is dangerous factors causing the urinary tract to infect. This association rules in type II Diabetes didnít appear, but was found in the Metabolic Syndrome result It revealed that patients with Diabetes, Hypertension Hyperlipidemia will get urinary diseases easier than patient with only Diabetes diseases Table 5.

There is up to 70% of confidence that Metabolic Syndrome patients have liver disease connection with Diabetes, Hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The following table 7 shows the mining result. The chronic hepatitis includes chronic virus hepatitis mainly have A , B , C , D , E five types, the alcoholic hepatitis, and fatty liver. Metabolic Syndrome patients may have unusual liver function cause of fat, or other metabolism causes induce to chronic hepatitis. No related studies show this connection at present. This research used the mining of Apriori find a considerable association that can help specialist as an assistance of diagnose. And it also warned the metabolic syndromes patients to take care of their livers  V CONCLUSION This research used the method of descriptive statistic to realize the prevalence and population of the two groups Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome patients  From the descriptive statistic, there are more patients of females than males, and it will increase with aging Insurance used in these two groups are calculated and is useful for the National Health Insurance .Our result can provide the National Health Insurance carrying on survey on the related insurance fee. Adjust the expense and the incoming of specific groups, and improve the reasonable use of health resources In practical, data mining used in lots of area and had a great outcomes, but in medical diagnose assistance, there  is few research that study on the relation between ICD-9 This research used the association rules mining the Health Insurance Data which includes more than 10 million records. Complete consultation records made this research more significant. The Metabolic Syndrome gets more and more attention from the public and the medical science and considered as a disease of civilization. The coming diseases are discussed in many researches. Using mining method to find diseases from Diabetes and from Metabolic Syndrome is the main goal of this research, the result can be concluded into two region as follow 1 Type two diabetes associated diseases In the past diagnosed records of type two Diabetes patients, ICD-9 of Diabetes will be related with oral diseases \(Periodontosis, Pulpitis, Dental caries, Acute gingivitis\. These mining results are the same as the clinical experiments and the present research Furthermore, diseases conjunctivitis and Senile cataract cardiovascular disease are connected with Diabetes Because there exist intersection influence between diseases, the mining result can be a diagnose support when doctors giving a diagnosis 2 Metabolic Syndrome associated diseases Besides the association rules found in the Diabetes, the more important is that the affect of urinary system and the liver organ. Metabolic Syndrome patients have more issues than Diabetes patients in urinary system. The association rules mining from the data have higher support and confidence. Besides, chronic liver and the Instances Support Confidence Consequent Antecedent 1 Antecedent 2 5148 16 68.5 Diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, Type II Chronic hepatitis unspecified Malignant hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure 7957 24.7 40.8 Chronic hepatitis unspecified Acute upper respiratory infections of other multiple sites Table 7.

relation between Metabolic Syndrome is the new findings from our research From our research, we prove that using data mining can find the relation of diseases that are similar with the results which are experimented from clinical. And some results that are not proved by clinical experiment, such as the connection between liver and Metabolic Syndrome The relation between diseases can help the doctor diagnose in order to prevent the occurrence of illness. The way of our research also provides the medical research a different way to explore physical mystery  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We thank Bureau of National Health Insurance for providing data REFERENCE  G.

Therefore, in this paper we mainly focused on the problem to find all the longest intervals for each cycle To confront the above problem efficiently, we introduced two main search techniques IVP Interval Validation Process\ and PSM \(Process Switching Mechanism\.  In this paper we have presented an effective mining approach for finding all the periodic time intervals for a given sequential pattern. As a future work the process presented in this paper can be extended to find periodic time intervals for all the given sequential patterns in one database scan However to accomplish this task a more complex data-structure/memory management technique needs to be implemented REFERENCES 1  X  Chen and I.
