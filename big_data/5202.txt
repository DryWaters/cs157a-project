Data mining research community is just starting to pay attention to intervention analysis. As the traditional association rules are not successful at measuring intervention, this paper tries to mining intervention rules from time series data of subcomplex system. The main contributions of this study include: \(1 introduces a new concept of intervention rules. It can quantitatively detect at what scale, how intensive and how long the intervention does make sense; \(2\nduct wavelet transform on time series. The decomposition scale can denotes the intervention scale; \(3\roposes a new concept named directional correlation to measure intervention intensity; \(4\culates the intervention intensity between time series data with different time delays. The time delay can uncover after how long the intervention takes place; \(5\ conducts experiments on real datasets. The results show that intervention rules do exist at different decomposition scale of the original data. Moreover, the number of rules discovered by multi-scale analysing methods is always 4 or 5 times more than those found by single scale methods. And the stability of rules discovered by the improved multi-scale mining algorithm MMIR  is always 100%, while the stability of rules discovered by the basic multi-scale mining algorithm MMIR  fluctuate around 70  Keywords Intervention rule, Time series, multi-scale, Directional correlation  I   I NTRODUCTION  In the fields of market regulation, unemployment rate control and influenza supervision, intervention is widely used to control the stability of the system.

Multiple resolution analysis  wavelet transform  and correlation analysis  are widely used in time series analysis also. However, many researches consider time series to be an atomic sequence. In practice, the series may contain several sub-series. Thus, to obtain interest relationships, it is more important to analyse those series at multiple scales II  M INING M ULTI SCALE I NTERVENTION R ULE  A  Goal of this study Given a pair of two time series, the goal of this study is to firstly generate all candidate intervention rules, and then returns rules with intensity higher than a specified threshold B  Generate candidate intervention rules The algorithm can be described by example 2 Example 2 Consider example 1. Figure 2 shows how to generate intervention rules from breath rate to heart rate. The algorithm contains straightforwardly three key steps Figure 2 Generate candidate intervention rules Step 1 Decompose the original time series into 2 sub-series at decomposition scale 1 and 2 using discrete wavelet transform Fig 2b,c Step 2 Shift breath rate of each sub-series \(Fig 2b,c\ong the time axis forward 1 timestamp \(Fig 2 d, f\ and 2 timestamps Fig 2 e, g\. This step results in 4 kinds of relationships between breath rate and heart rate Step 3 Calculate the intensity of the 4 sub-series between breath rate and heart rate Thus 4 candidate intervention rules can be generated.

The next step is to scan for frequent occurring linguistic itemsets that satisfy the user-defined s upport thresholds The linguistic IS transformation serves a two-fold purpose i.e replaces the decision classes in the original decision system with linguistic terms and transform the deci sion table into a linguistic IS table. This is an important st ep before the frequent pattern mining in order to generate lingui stic frequent pattern instead of quantitative frequent p attern. The linguistic terms carry different RMV weightage towa rds the discretised RMR intervals The decision classes wil l be replaced by user-defined linguistic terms Replacin g the decision classes with predefined linguistic terms w ill  change the decision classes into different rough linguisti c sets [19   User-defined linguistic terms were used in the expe riments Therefore this process requires the intervention of  expert knowledge Rough membership function helps in captu ring the uncertainty boundary of the rough linguistic se t, but user understanding of the dataset used is still necessar y in order to determine suitable linguistic terms to be replaced Imprecise terms chosen may result in deviation of the meaning  of the rules However this would not affect the process o f rules generation and the performance of the association r ules Choosing suitable linguistic terms with expert know ledge is not the focus of this paper. The second part of the linguistic decision system transformation is to convert the or iginal decision system into a linguistic decision system Similar to fuzzy decision system proposed in [26   t h e  a t t r i b u tes in the linguistic decision system are the linguistic terms  chosen previously while the attributes values are the RMV attained from respective rough intervals.

numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
