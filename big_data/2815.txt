Store SVG Document in ORDBMS  Jinfeng Gao GuiZhou University GuiYang City, China gaojinfeng0213@163.com Xiaorong Chen GuiZhou University GuiYang City, China xrchengz@163.com   Abstract Because of big SVG document storing spatial data in WebGis, The searching by attribute is low efficiency and need the high quality hardware in the client. In order to solve the two problems, by making use of the rules mapping DTD of SVG document to relation schema extended for being fitted for SVG document, we complete storing SVG document in Objectrelational database. Finally, we realized management of the spatial data by tag document to by Objected Relational database and achieved the expected results Keywords SVG; Algorithm; Schema mapping; DTD; DTD Graph; Object-relational  database I   I NTRODUCTION  SVG\(Scalable Vector Graphic\built upon XML and used for publishing graph and image in Web Was recommended by W3C\(World Wide Web Consortium\ in September 2001, and was expected to meet the need of web-developer that drawing the graph and painting the image is dynamic, scalable and platform irrelevant. Applying SVG in WebGIS[1  n o w  WebGIS based on SVG document storing graph and image data have realized navigation 002 panning, layer control and searching by attribute in electronic map[2  B e c a u s e s p a t ial  data applied in GIS often are big data set, even some are magnanimous[3 i n t h e pro c e ss o f  p ubl i s hi ng geo g rap hy information by SVG document we find the storing spatial data SVG document is very large and the large document result in low efficiency of search by attribute and the need of high quality hardware in client. Considering the progress of ORDBMS in data management in recent years, In order to solve above problem, we proposed storing SVG document in ORDBMS and realize management of spatial data by SVG document to by ORDBMS[4  According to the above problem and considering the progress of management for spatial data of the ORDBMS, such as POSTGI a nd O r a c l e 9i   w e  e x t e n d t h e a l gor i t hm  o f  mapping the XML document DTD to OR schema, store SVG document in ORDBMS, and succeed in realizing the transformation from the management of spatial data by SVG document to by ORDBMS. So, the method not only can reduce the space, but also can improve the efficiency of managing spatial data II  RELATED  WORK Considering SVG is based on XML, some approaches or technologies of storing XML in ORDBMS proposed and discussed in recent years can be utilized when addressing storing SVG documents in ORDBMS Object-Relational database management System ORDBMS\ products have all the advantages of RDBMS furthermore, it has more expressive type system than RDBMS and supply a number of functions of processing the spatial data The high performance of ORDBMS in spatial data management supply the security of successful solving the problem resulting from large SVG document and is the main impetus we storing the SVG document in ORDBMS Alexander Adam[6 st ed  b u i l d i ng a SV G  p l at for m  used for processing the data retrieving from database. In this method of publishing GIS information, the cost of constructing platform is too high Ref[7  p r o p o s e d c o n s tru c tin g a s p a tia l d a t a b a se  p l a t f o rm  storing the SVG document. This approach also need build a new platform and can’t make full use of the development of ORDBMS, so, still have a lot of drawbacks To sum up, it is feasible to solve the problem resulted from large SVG document by storing the SVG document in ORDBMS. Of course, we should emphasize the SVG document in this paper is used for storing spatial data rather than the general graph and image data III  THE  FEATURE  AND  OGANIZATION  OF  SPATIAL  DATA Because the SVG document in this paper is used for storing spatial data and the data structure of spatial data is complex, we should know how to classify, describe and organize the geographic objects. In general, according to its geometry, the geographic objects are divided into five categories point  line  polygon  annotation and raster 8  T h e or ga ni z a t i o n o f spa t i a l  data is same type of entity tiered In order to illustrate the organizational and expressive model of spatial GIS data in SVG, taking into account the limited length of paper, we give an example of releasing geographical data based on SVG document basically including five spatial data types. The SVG document appears in following program code.  Although we have omitted most of the coordinates of spatial points, the structure of the SVG document is full of reservations and clear. The geographical data published by the SVG document rendered on the client shows As shown in Figure1

Because SVG is based on XML, SVG document have its DTD [9  Th e D T D of  SVG d o cu m e n t  is cr eat e d  a t  t h e  same time the SVG document do and is saved in head files, of course, instead, also can be gotten by XML parser A D T D  specifies the structure of a SVG element by specifying the names of its sub-elements and attributes. Sub-element structure is specified using the operators “*”\(set with zero or more elements\ “+”\(set with one or more elements\?”\(optional and “|”\(or\ There is a special attribute Id, which can occur once for each element. The Id attribute uniquely identifies an element within a SVG document and can be referenced through an IDREF field in another element. Figure2 shows a DTD specification. The SVG document in Section3 conforms to this DTD  Figure2 The SVG Document’s DTD A DTD graph represents the structure of a DTD. Its nodes are elements, attributes and operators in the DTD. Each element appear as many times as they appear in the DTD. The DTD graph corresponding to the DTD in Figure2 is given in Figure3   Figure3 DTD graph of svg document  B  The OR Schema Generation Algorithm Traditionally, relational schemas have been derived from a data model such as the Entity-Relationship model. This translation is straightforward, because there is a clear separation between entities and their attributes. Each entity and its attributes are mapped to a relation. when converting a SVG DTD to relations, It is tempting to map each element in the DTD to a relation and map the attributes of the element to attributes of the relation. However, there is no correspondence between elements and attributes of DTD and entities and attributes of the ER-model. Taking an example of node g in the Figure3, It has five child nodes Id  path  use  text  symbol In five nodes, excepting Id others are all not attributes, because they appear in the form of tag in the SVG document. Now, in the process of mapping DTD graph into OR schema, we should

know which node is mapped into independent table and which attributes. In order to solve the problem, we extend the Hybrid method [11 m a p p in g th e D T D o f X M L in to Rel a ti o n a l  database schema, get the new rules of mapping the DTD of SVG document into OR schema. The rules as follows[12   1  relations are created for all elements in the DTD graph whose nodes have an in-degree greater than one 2  Elements nodes with an in-degree of zero are also made separate relations 3  Elements below “*” node are made into separate relations 4  Each element node x that is a separate relation inlines all the nodes y that are reachable from it such that the path from x to y does not contain a node that is to be made a separate relation 5  When one element quotes more than one element node that are created independent relations, in order to let the getting OR schema has less redundant degree, we use several relations between the tag element and the quoted elements to represent this single relation 6  If one element node is CDATA or PCDATA,we add a new attribute of the same name to the element node in order to store the data expressed by the element node According to the above rules, we extend the XML mapping algorithm proposed in Ref[13 t o m a p SV G D T D i n t o  O R  schema. The mapping process consists of two phases. The first phase is to generate the DTD graph based on the given DTD document, and then in the second phase the corresponding Object-relational schema is created on the basis of the generated DTD graph. Alg1[1  i s t h e p s e udo cod e s o f  our improved mapping algorithm. Here, the code line 1~8 are for DTD graph creation, and code line 9~12 are for OR schema generation. We use the ProcessNode\( code line 13~35\ to process the nodes. Applying the above mapping rules and algorithm to the example SVG DTD in section4, we have the resulted OR schema in Figure4. From the Figure4, we get eight relation tables. Among them, Table svg is for storing the basic information of SVG document; Table symbol is for storing the user-defined reusable symbols; In order to get a low redundant OR schema, we divided table g into four tables g_text  g_path  g_symbol  g_use Using the four tables, we record the relation between the layers and the data in the layer; table use is for storing the cited symbol from the table symbol table path is for storing spatial data. It needs to be emphasized that the type of the spatial data in the OR is geometry The geometry in the ORDBMS \(POSTGIS\ is abstract data type and can include other spatial data type \(such as point  polygon  line the same as tag path can express any spatial data type \(the attribute d of tag path with one pair of spatial coordinates indicates point  type; the attribute d having a series of pairs of spatial coordinates and being at the end without character “z” indicates line type, otherwise indicates polygon type\. Of course, we can use tag line  polygon and point to store spatial data in the SVG document. In this case, by mapping rules and algorithm, we can easily get the corresponding table line  polygon and point  There is no detail description of the above circumstances because the given example in this paper store spatial data by tag path  Algorithm1  Mapping SVG DTD to OR schema INPUT 002 DTD of SVG document OUTPUT: the mapped OR schema 1 002 create the tree of DTD  marked as DTD T  T V  T E  2 002 for each T v 002 T V do  3 002 create the corresponding node G v 002 G V 002  4 002 for each T e 002 T E do  5 002 create the corresponding edge G e 002 G E 002  6 002 for each T V a 002 reference as other  element g do  7 002 create the corresponding edge e  a  g  002 G E 002  8 002   G G DTD E V G    9 002 traverse DTD G  10 002 for G V v 002 in-degree and parent node recorded as   deg v in and  v parent respectively 11 002 for each   deg v in 0 or  v parent  G V v 002  12 002 ProcessNode v  002  13 002 Procedure ProcessNode v  14 002 child v the set of child nodes of v  15 002 the number of  *  recorded as starnumb child v  16 002 if starnumb child v 1 then  17 002 for each ch v 002 child v  do  18 002 if ch v  then  19 002 tem v getchild ch v  002 get the child node of ch v  20 002 tem v work as IDREF column 21 002 else if ch v 002 child v and ch v  22 002 ch v work as attribute column 23 endfor  24 002 create a relationship with the corresponding node v  25 002 endif  26 002 if starnumb child v 2 then  27 002 for each ch v 002 child v  003 ch v  do  28 002 tem v getchild ch v  002 get the child node of ch v  29 002 tem v work as IDREF column 30 002 if ch v 002 child v and ch v  then  31 ch v work as attribute column 32 endif  33 002 create a relationship with the corresponding node v  34 002 endfor  35 002 endif

Among them, the attribute column d of table path is type of geometry Of course, If we express the spatial objects by tag line  polygon not by tag path we will store the spatial objects by the corresponding type in the OR database.

  DTD Graph Generator produces the DTD graph according to the input SVG document. It performs the first part work of Alg1 We conduct some preliminary experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with a group of SVG document of different sizes from 0.2MB to 12MB, the experimental results are shown in Figure7 and Figure8. Figure7 shows the elapsed times of query processing over SVG document directly and in Object-relational database, from which we can see that by storing SVG document into ORDBMS with our approach, the query processing efficiency can be improved obviously. Figure8 shows the comparison of occupied disk space between in SVG document directly and in object-relational database. For all the tested documents, needs of disk space in SVG document is more than in ORDBMS which is an expected result      000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\025\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\026\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\027\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\030\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\031\000\021\000\023\000\023 000\032\000\021\000\023\000\023 245 432 6 15 812 9 45 1 1 15 2 25 3 3201 5 94 5 1 21 2 0 T est doc.size 002 KB 002 Time cost 002 sec 002 in document in dat abase  Figure7Searching time cost in database vs in document                    0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 s d 1 s d 2 s d 3 s d 4 sd 5 s d 6 sd 7 sd 8 sd9 sd1 0 Test doc.NO space cost.size 002 KB 002 in document in dat abase  Figure8 Space cost size in document vs in database  Our prototype enables 1\ to create an object-relational schema according to a given SVG DTD by using the mapping rules, and 2\ to store any valid SVG document in relations of the corresponding Object-relational schema, and 3\ to process spatial and non-spatial queries over the stored SVG document VII  CONCLUSION  We basically resolve the low efficiency of search by attribute and the need of high quality hardware in client by storing SVG document in OR database.  Of course, there are still some problems needed to do a closer study 1  On the premise of getting right OR schema , how to improve the mapping rules and algorithm in order to get optimum OR schema 2  In this paper, we don’t do research  on drawing spatial geography objects using Bezier curve A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  We would like to thank Dr. WANG Shuliang for providing advisable suggestion about the layout of the paper.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
