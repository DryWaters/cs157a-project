Moreover, it effectively eliminates noisy transactions from the transaction database. The methodology used for this algorithm, also lead to a better way of calculating Support and hence provides new insights in non-binary data clustering Further studies will concentrate on testing the algorithm on real environment in order to prove its practical utility and in extending the algorithm for clustering transactions involving heterogeneous items in non-dataset  6 References  1 g ra w a l R I m ie lin sk i T  S w a m i A     M in in g  association rules between sets of items in large databases Intl.

The basic Apriori algorithm follows Bottom-Up approach where as the proposed method follows organized transaction selection approach It avoids the generation of combinations of items which inturn reduces the number of database scans. The result shows improvement in execution time  8. References   Ji awei Han and  M i ch el i n e   K a m b er  Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  Morgan  Kaufmann Publishers,  2001  2 R.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
