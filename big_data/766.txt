In Aerospace applica tions, it is important that motor fault signatures are identified before a failure occurs It is known that 40% of mechanical failures occur due to bearing faults. Bearing faults can be identified from the motor vibration signatures. Second, we develop a wireless sensor module for collection of vibration data from the testbed. Wireless sensors have been used because of their advantages over wired sensors in remote sensing. Finally we use a novel two-stage neural network to classify various bearing faults. The first stage

In corrective maintenance, a repair is performed after a failure has occurred. Condition-based maintenance \(CBM approach of preventive maintenance. The process of CBM involves monitoring the system, predicting failures and making repairs before these failures occur. A system can contain many fault modes and a decision has to be taken on the type of repair necessary for eliminating any future faults [7 4 4 3    Monitoring of the system is done using a range of sensors which can either be wired or wireless. Wireless sensors are generally used to enable remote monitoring Wireless Sensor Networks \(WSN\rovide an intelligent platform to 
gather and analyze data without human intervention Typically, a sensor network consists of autonomous wireless sensing nodes that are organized to form a network. Each node is equipped with sensors, embedded processing unit, short-range radio communication module and power supply, which is typically 9-volt battery. With recent innovations in MEMS sensor technology, WSN hold significant promise in many application domai  In this paper, we concentrate on CBM for induction motors. In Aerospace applications it is important that motor fault signatures are identified before a failure occurs. Some of the common problems in induction motors are: bearing stator winding, and rotor bar failures. Since the bearings carry the weight of the rotor, its fault diagnosis becomes very important. A multi-layered feed forward Neural

In this paper, we have made use of a two stage Neural Network through which online adaptive reformulation is possible  This method eliminates the need for the entire set of data to be present for classification as opposed to back propagation method and hence, saves on the processing time if the volume of data is large. Principal Component Analysis for feature extraction used in the first stage of NN is advantageous compared to statistical methods as it avoids batch processing. There is no 


  2 compromise on resolution as in the case of AR modeling The proposed algorithm works well both with linear and non-linear systems in comparison to Radial Basis Function and back propagation methods, which work best when the system is linear  In this paper, we concentrate on motor bearing fault diagnosis and prognosis. It has been shown that 40% of machine failures occur due to bearing problems.  Since the mechanical faults are the faults pertaining to the bearings of the machine, their maintenance is very important [36   Th e causes for the bearing faults may be Mechanical Damage Improper handling of the bearings results in dents and nicks, cau sing displacement of the metal particles which can introduce secondary effects in the motor Damage due to wear Wear and tear in the bearings may result in a gradual deterioration of the motor. These conditions may become prominent for the bearing failure in the long run Corrosion Damage This damage comes into picture when the motor is operated in a moist atmosphere. The moisture in the air causes surface oxida tion and rusting, paving the way for abrasion and crack initiation Crack Damage This occurs when the motor is subjected to large stresses through overloading or cyclic loading. Cracks may also be produced because of manufacturing defects and improper heat treatment and grinding Electric Arc Damage Bearings can be damaged when the grounding of the equipment is not done properly. An arc is produced between non contacting elements and its runways when current passes through it Damage due to lubricants It is caused due to improper lubrication system of the bearings which is present between the rolling elements and the r aceways. More details can be obtained from   In this work, we design a test-bed for simulating bearing faults in a motor. We design a custom wireless sensor module for gathering vibration data from the motor. We use a two stage neural network design to classify and diagnose different fault modes from the collected vibration data. The first stage neural network uses the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm \(GHA\o estimate the principal components of various fault m Pri n ci pal C o m ponent  Anal y s i s  i s  used for two reasons: a\ reduce the dimensionality of the data and b\ to extract the f eatures. Neural Networks are preferred for PCA estimation rather than statistical methods because of its flexibility in terms of online adaptive reformulation  The second stage neural network uses a supervised learning vector quantization \(SLVQ\etwork utilizing a self organizing map approach. This stage is used to classify various fault modes. The output of the first stage neural network is fed as an input to the second stage neural network  The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the construction of the test-bed for simulating various bearing faults. It also describes the design of the wireless sensor module used for gathering vibration data from the test-bed. Section III describes the two stage neural network architecture for fault diagnosis. Section IV shows the results of this work describing the performance analysis. Section V concludes our work 2  T HE T EST B ED  This section describes the construction of the test-bed used for simulating mechanical b earing faults in a motor. It also describes the design of the wireless sensor module used for collecting vibration data from the test-bed A. Test-bed for Bearing Fault Simulation For a particular bearing geom etry, the rolling elements in the bearing produce vibration spectra which have unique frequency components. These frequency components along with their magnitude help in determining the condition of the bearing. The test-bed for th e mechanical fault consists of a motor to which a flywheel is attached \(Figure 1  This is enclosed in a metallic cage for the purpose of safety \(Figure 2 s are attached to it. The most important element of this test-bed is the flywheel which has holes drilled in it \(Figure 3b\. The weights applied to these holes produce imbalance in th e flywheel, th ereby in the motor. The flywheel actually simulates the corrupted bearings of the motor. The holes are drilled in three concentric rings- inner, middle and outer as shown in Figure 3a  The severity of the fault is determined by the location of the weight- the highest being when the weight is applied on the outermost ring and vice versa The disc, therefore acts as the load to the motor, with the screws \(weights\simulating the mechanical fault at the bearings of the motor  The increase in the addition of the weight increases the frictional loss which in turn would increase the total loss in the motor and hence reduce the efficiency of the machine Another reason for the imbalance in the motor is also a shift in the center of gravity of th e flywheel when weights are added to it  The motor rotates in order to reduce the effect of this shift so that the entire weight acts through the center of the body The test bed described above gives an economical method to emulate the bearing fault behavior B. Wireless Sensors  Wireless sensors are used for measuring the vibration data from the test-bed. A custom PCB, designed at Automation and Robotics Research Institute, has been used for the wireless sensing. The remote sensing board contains a Microchip PIC 18F4550 microprocessor running at 20 MHz connected to a small low power, 3-Axis \2613g iMEMS Accelerometer \(ADXL330 microcontroller module.  This module transmits in the 2.4 GHz spectrum using the 802.15.4 wireless protocol. In this setup, the PIC microcontrolle r is dedicated entirely to collecting the samples using its onboard analog to digital 


  3 peripheral and then transmitting them through its UART peripheral to the Jennic module for wireless transmission to the computer. The Jennic is responsible for receiving the incoming serial data and transmitting it as quickly as possible. Previously attempts were made to use only the Jennic which has its own analog to digital peripheral, but the module by itself was too slow to handle the data collection and transmission functions together  The receiving end consists of another Jennic module that receives the samples and output s a digital representation on the UART.  The UART of the Jennic module is connected to the computer's serial port via a TTL-RS232 converter. The firmware for this project consists of the programs running on both the PIC and the Jennic modules The Jennic firmware was created using the freely provided Jennic SDK.  The firmware is based on a Jennic provided application note that provides interrupt-driven transmission of serial data over the wireless radio.  On the receiving end the firmware on the Jennic formats the sample data in a manner to make it easier to parse and use by the computer application.  The PIC firmware was developed using the CCS compiler for mid-range PIC microcontrollers.  This firmware was optimized to collect 8-bit samples at a rate commensurate with the bandwidth of the RF link.  As the samples are collected at the desired sample rate, they are stored in a FIFO buffer and sent to the Jennic module as the UART becomes available This wireless board also has many other capabilities not utilized in this project.  Originally, it was designed and used for autonomous aerial vehicle control.  In addition to collecting analog data, it is also capable of interfacing to sensors that use simple general purpose IO or synchronous serial busses including I2C.  It is also capable of driving its IO pins to logic levels and generating PWM signals for possible control applications. Figure 4 shows the wireless modules used for the experiment. Figure 5 shows the arrangement of the sensor for recording the three dimensional vibration data from the motor. This arrangement is chosen to maintain uniformity in zandyx  values obtained each time 3  T HE T WO S TAGE N EURAL N ETWORK C LASSIFIER   The analysis of the data obtained is done using a novel two stage neural network, where the first stage is used for estimation of Principal Components and the second stage    A. First Stage: PCA estimation  The dimensionality of the la rge amount of data recorded is reduced using Principal Component Analysis. This reduction is done by retaining only those values in the data set which have a significant value of variance.  The main Figure 1. Conceptual design for the mechanical test-bed          Figure 2.

 for a particular fault. The data points obtained are converted to 1D vector given by i 327  The mean of the data set is   12 11  ik M M M   4 advantage of this method is that the information content is retained despite a reduction in the dimensionality. PCA is used for two reasons: a\ reduce the dimensionality of the data and b\ to extract the f eatures. Hebbian Learning Rule Neural Network is used for PCA estimation. Information on PCA estimation using GHA can be found in It i s used because it extracts m actual principal eigenvectors as those obtained from the conventional method. The conventional method consists of finding the mean of the data set, then subtracting the mean from each of the data values calculating the covariance matrix and then finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The calculation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix helps in extraction of those lines which characterize the data. The eige nvectors calculated are then arranged in a descending order, after which the components with lesser significance can be ignored. The chosen eigenvectors are then used to fo rm the feature vector in the columns. Further information can be found in  Hence PCA compresses the data 1 n X 006\006      4  The eigenvectors of C are computed to form the transformation matrix W It can be observed that the dimension of the matrix C is 004\004\004\004   1 And subtracting the mean from the original data gives the difference value as  ii 004 corresponding to the data point i The dimension of i 004 is 005 005 212     2 Where 1 2,3 iM  where 1 m yR 327  Here W matrix represents the eigenvectors chosen   Neural Networks is preferred for PCA estimation rather than statistical methods because of its flexibility in terms of online adaptive reformulati  The convent i onal  method involves calculation of the covariance matrix and then application of the diagonalization procedure for extracting the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors As the size of the data increases, matrix manipulation and computation becomes cumbersome and inefficient due to round off errors. Hence, this poses a limitation on the statistical based methods  a b Figure 4. \(a\c Wireless Module, \(b Module      Figure 5. The Conceptual Diagram showing the alignment of the sensor with respect to the motor    Let us take an example in order to understand the difference between the 2 approaches: The dimension of the vibration data obtained is  T 3 corresponds to the x, y, and z axis vibration readings and 16000 corresponds to the data points  and suppose the total number of data sets is 100 M   1 N  where 3 16000 48000 N 006 004      48000,100 The covariance matrix C is obtained as  1 1 M TT nn n CA A M    NN which makes it cumbersome to compute the N eigenvectors. As the number of eigenvectors giving information about the data is equal to the number of training data sets over which the information is obtained; therefore, only M eigenvectors are used to form the W matrix. In order to compute the M eigenvectors the following method is used, where a new matrix is given as  T LAA     5 Now, the dimension of L is    M M The complete formulation of the principal components is given in  Through this way, only M eigenvectors are computed instead of computing N eigenvectors. One of the main disadvantages of using the statistical based method to determine the principal components is that it is based on batch processing, where all the information needs to be known a priori In order to update the principal 4 needs to be carried out if a new data set comes into the system. In order to avoid this problem, Neural Networks are used in stage 1 to estimate the principal components of the data set, instead of the original matrix algebra method based on batch computation. The advantage of using NN instead of batch matrix computation to calculate the principal component is that it gives the flexibility of online adaptive reformulation as well as recursive updating of the principal components. Using NN for PC estimation does not require having all the information at once i.e. batch processing is avoided. As the data sets are assimilated one by one, the PC are updated sequentially. If a new data set 45 deg Flywheel Surface Fl oo r l eve l Sensor al ignment Motor Body Flywheel 006\006 006   1  M A 327 002\003 and gives a lower dimension of y WX      3 Where the dimension of A is 


  m is the number of principal components to be estimated and N is the number of input vectors.

A bank of NN is used for each fault condition, which makes the system robust The neural network deployed in NN banks is based on Sangers rule and uses Generalized Hebbian Algorithm GHA\to estimate the principal components. The main advantage of using the Sangers rule is that the network naturally orders the principal components by magnitude. As mentioned earlier, the estimation of the principal components is basically the determination of the transformation matrix W The determination of the transformation matrix W using the Sangers rule, in scalar form is given as 212 212 212 212 212 212         7 with respect to W using the steepest descent gradient met  X is the input and y is the output \(as in y WX  Further variations of the update rules are given  The reason of us ing Sangers rule based on GHA is that it extracts the m actual principal eigenvectors as those obtained from original matrix algebra method B. Second Stage Neural Network The second stage is used to classify the input data where the output of the first stage becomes the input to the second stage. The classification step only requires distinguishing between different classes of faults by modeling the class boundaries. This type of learning is called as discriminative learni and i t does not requi re est i m at i ng t h e cl ass feature densities. To achieve discriminative learning a supervised learning vector quantization \(LVQ\work is used. LVQ is a hybrid network and uses a self organizing map approach. It is based on winner-take-all policy and uses training vector to distinguish the different categories of the input. Since LVQ network tends to have shorter training time then the backpropogation or RBF, and processing time being an important constraint in the approach mentioned LVQ network proves to be advantageous over backpropogation and RBF t h e performance of these networks has been compared The supervised LVQ network is trained using standard Kohonen learning rule. More details on this rule are given  Figure 6 in the first layer is assigned to a class and then each class is assigned to one neuron in the second layer   Figure 6. LVQ Network  4  I MPLEMENTATION AND P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS  A. Implementation  The implementation involves recording the vibration data from the motor over a period of five days. The vibration data is measured for conditions of no weight as well as for weights of 5g, 10g, 15g, 20g applied on the inner, middle and outer rings of the flywheel respectively. Each of the experiment \(for a particular weight and its position on the flywheel\ed five times The data recorded is then used for PCA estimation and prediction of the motor condition for fault diagnosis.  Figure 7 shows the classification of the input data after passing through the artificial neural network for different weights, where the x  y  and z axes represent the x  y and z principal component vector of the vibration data respectively. For this experiment, we have only considered the highest principal component for each fault case. A classifier maps a list of measured features into a classification state. The second stage NN Classifier actually implements nonlinear decision boundaries which uses \223 K nearest neighbor\224 discriminant function analysis to benchmark the neural network\222s performance. The nearest neighbor classifier can be explained as follows: If it is required to classify an unknown vector x where a number of classes are represented by sample points in a feature space vector, then this is done by finding the point closest to x and assigning the closest point\222s class to it. In K nearest neighbor nearest K points to x are found, and x gets assigned the class which is represented by the largest number of neighboring points.   This classification of data paves the way for formulation of confusion matrix \(with the help of testing data\d finally the Operating Characteristics  and Nj 2,1 265       6 where mi 2,1 


  6 B. Performance Analysis  We make use of the confusion matrix to evaluate the algorithm. We also make use of health index for evaluating the performance of the machine when weights are added to various regions of the flywheel 1. Confusion Matrix Confusion matrix is a visualization tool used for performance evaluation. Figure 8 shows one such confusion matrix. Details on this can be obtained from 43 44 It  gives a degree of correlation between various parameters such as features, classes, etc It is a square matrix where the entries represent the degree of correlation between it\222s th i and th j element. The number of rows and columns is equivalent to the number of classes. The columns represent the system\222s classification wher e as the rows represent the true classification. For a perfect system, only the diagonal elements will be present in the confusion matrix, where as the presence of off diagonal elements indicates misclassification. The sum of all the elements is equal to the number of testing data. The entries  ij c give the data which are actually of class i but are classified as class j  by the Neural Network System. Thus, it allows the user to understand the manner in which the classes have been confused with each other  Figure 8. Confusion Matrix  True Positive \(TP\ives the number of correct predictions; False Positive \(FP\ives the number of incorrect predictions; False Negative \(FN\gives the number of misses and True Negative \(TN\s the number of correct rejections. Out of all the recorded data, some data sets were chosen for testing the performance of the two stage neural network. This method of formulating the Confusion Matrix is called the Generalization Test. After training, the testing data set of known categories is passed through artificial neural network classification system in order to find the number of correct and incorr ect classifications for each class for getting the TP and FP rates. Table 1 shows the confusion matrix for the testing data from which the true positive rate \(hits\rate \(wrong predictions\can be determined to get the Operation Characteristics \(OC\shown in Figure 9. The OC is a plot of the classifier\222s TP rate \(sensitivity\ainst the FP rate specificity\h sensitivity means that the classifier identifies most of the positive samples and its performance is good, where as high specificity means that the classifier identifies most of the negative samples and its performance is poor. The curve always goes through two points \(0,0 1,1\\(0,0\is the point at which no positives are found by the classifier, where as \(1,1 ves the point where the classifier finds everything as positive. At \(0,0\e classifier identifies all the negative cases correctly but the positive cases are identified incorrectly, whereas at \(1,1\the classifier identifies all the positive cases correctly but the negative cases get identified incorrectly. The graph shows the OC for each of the five days during which the experiment was performed. We can see from Figure 9 that the classification performance deteriorates from 93% to 76% by experiments from day 1 to day 5 respectively. This means that the condition of the motor deteriorates each day   Fi g ure 7. Classified Out p ut 


  1 H I if HV normal HV load  H V normal HV load  H V normal is the no load value which acts as the reference for the healthy system For the loaded system, the equation would be given by   9  The health index of the system can therefore be calculated as    H V normal HI H Vload   7  Figure 9. Classification Performance  2  Health Index  Health index is also plotted to evaluate the performance of the machine when the wei ghts are added to the various regions of the metallic disc simulating the faulty bearing The health index as the name i ndicates tells the state of the machine under a particular loading condition. Further information can be obtained from checks the condition of the motor under no load and then uses a fault dictionary to facilitate the use of feature recognition techniques to diagnose the faults. Signal behavior characteristics can be used to study the condition of the motor under no- load and loaded condition by which we can get the heath index to get the deviation from the normal condition  Table 1:  Confusion Matrix for Testing Data  The health index is calculated using        8 Where  1 2 n i jN Ymean normal ith sampled response   11   Figure 10. Health Index   It is clear from above that the health index would range good\ving an indication of the health of the system. For the experiment performed in the laboratory, it was found that the health index was larger for smaller values of weights applied on the inner ring compared to the larger value of weights which were applied on the outer ring. This also implies that the vibrations produced are lesser when the weights are applied on the inner ring as opposed to those applied on the middle and outer rings respectively. This would help condition monitoring systems to be implemented, where maintenance action can be brought into service at some predetermined value of failure. During failure, the latest response can be assigned as the cause for diagnosis 5  C ONCLUSIONS   This paper proposes diagnosis and prognosis of bearing faults using Wireless Modules and Wireless Sensors, where in, a novel two stage neural network has been used to analyze the vibration data obtained from the mechanical test-bed setup. The paper suggests an experimental setup which is a low cost approach for emulating bearing fault in a motor, to wirelessly sense the vibrations produced due to this fault. The fault classification algorithm used has certain features such as: \(a\ng PCA rather than conventional statistical methods to reduce th e dimensionality of the data b\A method which estimates and recursively calculates the principal components, hence, giving robustness in the diagnosis, \(c\Supervised Learning Quantization which has a fast processing time, \(d\nally, Operation Health Index for weights in the inner ring Health Index for weights in the middle and outer ring     Thus   if        10

The future work will be to use energy efficient wireless sensors and modules in order to make the Condition Based Maintenance more effective and compare the method with other CBM techniques A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   This work was supported by DoE SBIR through Signal Processing, Inc., 13619 Valley Oak Circle, Rockville MD20850 R EFERENCES  1  Barron R.,\224 Engineering Condition Monitoring  Practice  Methods and Applications 224, Langman Ltd 1996  2  Bishop C.M, \224Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition\224, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1995  3  Chen, C., \223Signal and image processing for remote sensing\224 CRC Press Technology & Industrial Arts 648 pages ISBN 0849350913, 2006  4  Chitroub S., Houacine A., and Sansal B., \223Principal Component Analysis of Multispectral Images Using Neural Networks, \224Computer Systems and Applications, ACS/IEEE Inte rnational, Page\(s 5  Dang, Pritpal S, \223A potential field approach for distributed control of discrete actuator and sensor arrays, Ph.D., University of Texas at Arlington, 2007 AAT 3288909, Page\(s 6  Daniel Herbert Hanson, \223Artificial Neural Network Based Survival Analysis for Hydro-Mechanical Systems\224, Ph.D., The University of Iowa, 2004 7  Davies A.,\224 Handbook of Condition Monitoring Techniques and Methodology\224 London: Chapman Hall, 1998 8  Erbay, Ali Seyfettin ,\223Mu ltisensor fusion for induction motor aging analysis and fault diagnosis 224 Ph.D.,  The University of Tennessee,  1999, 363 pages 9  Godi, G., Li B., Chow  M.Y. , Hung, J.C.  \223Motor Bearing Diagnosis by a Fundamental Frequency Amplitude Based Fuzzy Decision System \224, 24 th  Annual Conference of the I EEE Industrial Electronics Society, Vol. 4, pp. 1961-1965 10  Gorrell G., \223Generalized hebbian algorithm for incremental singular value decomposition in natural language processing\224, In EACL, 2006 11  Hasan, Ocak,  \223Fault detec tion, diagnosis and prognosis of rolling element bearings: Frequency domain methods and hidden Markov modeling\224,  Ph.D., Case Western Reserve University, 2004 12  Ham Fredric M., Kostanic Ivica,\224 Principles of Neurocomputing for Science and Engineering\224 McGraw-Hill, Inc ISBN  0070259666 13  Harris, T.A., Rolling bearing analysis, John Wiley 2001 14  Haykin Simon, \223Neural Networks, A Comprehensive Foundation\224, Pearson Education ISBN 81-7808-300-0 15  Heng, R.B.W. , Nor, M.J.M. ,\224 Statistical Analysis of Sound and Vibration Signals for Monitoring Rolling Element Bearing Condition\224, Applied Acoustics, Vol 53, pp. 211-226, 1998 16  Howard, I., \223A Review of Rolling Element Bearing Vibration: Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis\224 Aeronautical and Maritime Research laboratory Airframes and Engineer Division, 1994 17  Hsieh William W., \223Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis Using Auto Associative Neural Networks\224 AIChE Journal [0001-1541., KRAMER yr:1991 vol:37 iss:2 pg:233 18  Koosial, Jainarine, \223Neural Network Based classification of bearing faults in rotating machines Augmentation of vibration measurements with power measurements\224, M.Sc.Eng Queen's University at Kingston \(Canada\ AAT MR18753 19  Kwan C., X.Zhang, R Xu, and L.Haynes, \223A Novel Approach to Fault Diagnostics and Prognostics,\224 Int Conference on robotics and  Automation, May, 2003 20  Lai, Ming Sang ,\223Detection of developing bearing failures by means of  vibration analysis\224, Ph.D University of Windsor \(Canada\ AAT NN65146 21  Li Bo, Gregory Goddu, Mo-Yuen Chow, \223Detection of Common Motor Bearing Faults Using Frequency Domain Vibration Signals and a Neural Network Based Approach\224, Proceedings of the American Control Conference, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 1998 22  Li, C.J., Ma, J., \223Bearing Lo calization Defect Detection by Bicoherence Analysis of Vibrations\224, Journal of Engineering for Industry, Journal of Engineering for Industry, Vol. 117, pp. 625-629, 1995 23  Li, C.J. , Ma, J., \223Wavelet Decomposition of Vibrations for Detection of Bearing Localized Faults\224, NDT&E International, Vol. 30, pp.143-149 24  Lindsay I Smith, \223A tutorial on Principal Component Analysis\224 25  Li, Lingxin, \223Variable Speed AC Induction motor fault detection and diagnosis using artificial neural networks\224, M.Sc.\(Eng\s  University at Kingston \(Canada\ AAT MQ99911 26  Martin T., Hagan, Howard Demuth.

Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
