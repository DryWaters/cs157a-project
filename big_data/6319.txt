   iii PREFACE Dear Distinguished Delegates and Guests On behalf of the Organizing Committee, I would like to welcome all of you to ICCIA 2010. This is a conference Co-organized by Tianjin Polytechnic University, Harbin Engineering University Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE The theme of the ICCIA 2010 highlights Computer and Information Application. About 110 papers of high quality are accepted, less than 30% of the submitted ones. Of course the most important component of a conference is its technical program, which results from the hard work of the authors and the reviewers, to whom I wish to express my sincere appreciation ICCIA 2010 will provide a remarkable opportunity for the academic and industrial community to address new challenges, share solutions, and discuss future research opportunities within the area mentioned above. This conference is also a platform for the new faces to become known and for the previous attendees to refresh their friendships. It is expected that the large number of attendees including well-known scientists and engineers will bring many benefits to the scientific and technological development for many countries and to the formation of new international cooperation and strengthening of established international collaborations I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the Organizing Committee International Program Committee, and volunteers for their great efforts in preparation and commitment to make this conference a success I hope that all participants and other interested readers benefit scientifically from the proceedings and also find its stimulating in the process. Besides, I hope you enjoy all the wonderful experiences offered by the city of Tianjin, which is one of the most important sightseeing cities in China with its many historic spots and beautiful sceneries With my warmest regards Professor Zhenkai Wan General Chair of ICCIA 2010

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Our scheme eliminates all redundant rules in the sense of [25, 31], i.e. those association rules that are not in the covers. All the meta-rule deductive schemes implicitly included in [25] and [31] are induced by our method. The percentage of pruning, thus, outperforms [25 


The results produced for k=3, support 0.25 and confidences between 0.7 and 0.99 are shown in Fig. 3, in terms of pruning percentage \(vertical axis when applied to low confidences \(from 0.7 to 0.9 The percentage of pruning achieved diminishes as the confidence is superior to 0.9.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
