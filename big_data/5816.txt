However, user is often drown in information. Therefore, e-government attempt to offer more convenience through personalized information. Association rules mining is a good tool to provide personalized information. This 
paper discussed e-government concept and types, then put forward one method to provide personalized information in egovernment with association rules mining. An example was also presented in this paper Keywords-data mining; e-government;personalized information; association rule I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data Data mining is often seen as an increasingly important tool by modern business to transform data into business intelligence giving an informational advantage. Nowadays, data mining is 
not limited to business and it is widely used in various fields E-government can create a comfortable, transparent, and cheap interaction between government and citizens, business enterprises, governments respectively. Consequently, egovernment information is almost filled up in every field and it may make users get confused. Therefore personalized information of e-government can make users more convenient Data mining is a good tool to achieve it  II  EGOVERNMENT  A  Definition of E-government 
E-government has many definitions. “Digital administration. A description of digital and modern procedures applied in public administration, focusing on the needs of citizens and businesses 1 the ability for anyone visiting the city website to communicate and/or interact with the city via the Internet in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the generic city \(or webmaster\ email address provided at the site 2  In all, e-government is a general concept, which refers to the government's effective use of modern information and 
communication technologies, through various information services \(such as telephone and the internet, public computer stations etc.\, the government department, enterprises, and civil society organizations in its more convenient time, place and manner, the provision of automated information and other services consisting of a responsive, efficient and accountable with a higher quality of service the government 3 B  Types of e-government Usually, there are four types of e-government, governmentto-citizen \(G2C\, government-to-business \(G2B\, government 
to-employee \(G2E\nd government-to-government \(G2G G2C is the communication link between a government and private individuals or residents. Such G2C communication most often refers to that which takes place through information communication technologies, but can also include direct mail and media campaigns. G2C can take place at the federal, state and local levels 5  G2C includes information dissemination to the public, basic citizen services such as license renewals, ordering of birth/death/marriage certificates and filing of income taxes, as well as citizen assistance for such basic services as education 
health care, hospital information, libraries, and the like G2B transactions include various services exchanged between government and the business community, including dissemination of policies, memos, rules and regulations Business services offered include obtaining current business information, downloading application forms, renewing licenses registering businesses, obtaining permits, and payment of taxes The services offered through G2B transactions also assist in business development, specifically the development of small and medium enterprises. Simplifying application procedures 
that would facilitate the approval process for SME requests would encourage business development On a higher level, G2B services include e-procurement, an online government supplier exchange for the purchase of goods and services by government. Typically, e-procurement Web 978-1-4244-8694-6/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


sites allow qualified and registered users to look for buyers or sellers of goods and services. Depending on the approach buyers or sellers may specify prices or invite bids. Eprocurement makes the bidding process transparent and enables smaller businesses to bid for big government procurement projects. The system also helps government generate bigger savings, as costs from middlemen are shaved off and purchasing agents’ overhead is reduced G2E is the online interactions through instantaneous communication tools between government units and their employees and it is an effective way to provide e-learning to the employees, bring them together and to promote knowledge sharing among them. It also gives employees the possibility of accessing information in regard to compensation and benefit policies, training and learning opportunities and civil rights laws   G2G is the online non-commercial interaction between Government organizations, departments, and authorities and other Government organizations, departments, and authorities G2G services take place at two levels: at the local or domestic level and at the international level. G2G services are transactions between the central/national and local governments, and between department-level and attached agencies and bureaus. At the same time, G2G services are transactions between governments, and can be used as an instrument of international relations and diplomacy Additionally, some new types emerged recently. C2G Citizen-to-Government\, B2G \(Business-to-Government G2N \(Government-to-Nonprofit\d N2G \(NonprofittoGovernment\ are good examples 7  C  Personalized Information E-government makes government more efficient responsive, transparent, and legitimate. However, the amount of information available from e-government is overwhelming so that the users of e-government are constantly facing the problem of information overload. Fortunately, providing personalized information can provide a solution for this problem Personalized information is concerned with building a closer relationship and understanding the needs of individuals or group of customers, whether on the Internet or not. It is experiencing widespread adoption in application areas such as customer relationship management, e-commerce interaction and intimacy, and employee development and training, egovernment. Shortly speaking, it refers to the “right information” in the “right format” at the “right time III  A SSOCIATION R ULES M INING  A  Data Mining Data mining is the analysis of \(often large\ observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner  2  Data mining have many alias, s0uch as knowledge discovery in database\(KDD\ pattern discovery Knowledge extracting, data dredging, data archeology and so on 8  Data mining has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in data handling, and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. Researchers in many different fields have shown great interest in data mining. Several emerging applications in information providing services, such as data warehousing and on-line services over the Internet, also call for various data mining techniques to better understand user behavior, to improve the service provided, and to increase the business opportunities Data mining is not limited to business. Both major parties in the 2004 U.S. election utilized data mining of potential voters 9 Data mining has been heavily used in the medical field, to include diagnosis of patient records to help identify best practices 10 The Mayo Clinic worked with IBM to develop an online computer system to identify how that last 100 Mayo patients with the same age, gender and medical history had responded to particular treatments 11  B  Association Rules Mining Association rules mining is pioneer of data mining and one of the most active point of data mining 12 It shows attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widely-used example of association rule mining is Market Basket Analysis Association rule is defined as statements in the form of “ifthen”, of which “if” part and “then” part are called antecedent and consequent respectively. For example, if buy milk then buy bread. It could be used for adjusting store layouts\(placing items optimally with respect to each other\, for cross-selling, for promotions, for catalog design and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns. These rules are computed from the data, which is unlike the if-then rules of logic. By the way, association rules are probabilistic in nature Support” and “confidence” are two important numbers to express the degree of uncertainty about the rule The support is simply the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule. \(The support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database.\  Confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent \(namely, the support\ to the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent For example, if a market database has 100,000 point-of-sale transactions, out of which 2,000 include both items A and B and 800 of these include item C, the association rule "If A and B are purchased then C is purchased on the same trip" has a support of 800 transactions \(alternatively 0.8%=800/100,000 and a confidence of 40% \(=800/2,000 Lift is one more parameter of interest in the association rules mining. Lift is nothing but the ratio of Confidence to Expected Confidence. Expected Confidence in this case means using the above example, "confidence, if buying A and B does 


not enhance the probability of buying C." It is the number of transactions that include the consequent divided by the total number of transactions. Suppose the number of total number of transactions for C are 5,000. Thus Expected Confidence is 5,000/1,00,000=5%. For our supermarket example the Lift Confidence/Expected Confidence = 40%/5% = 8. Hence Lift is a value that  gives us information about the increase in probability of the "then" \(consequent\ given the "if antecedent\art C  Apriori algorithm Apriori algorithm is used to mine association rules in this example, which is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. It is designed to operate on databases containing transactions \(for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website frequentation   Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a levelwise search, where k-itemsets are used to explore \(k+1 itemsets. First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found by scanning the database to accumulate the count for each item and collecting those items that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted L 1 Next, L 1 is used to find L 2 the set of frequent 2-itemsets, which is used to find L 3 and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found 14 Then association rules are extracted out from the last largest frequent k-itemsets IV  U SING A SSOCIATION R ULES M INING TO P ROVIDE P ERSONALIZED I NFORMATION IN EGOVERNMENT  If information of website of e-government is considered as item in market basket analysis, association rules mining can be used to provide personalized information in e-government This part offers an example A  Data Source In this example, some websites of e-government visited by user are seen as items of market basket I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 and  I 5 are extracted identifier and the detailed information are shown as Tab1.

Obviously the second rule is useful Rule \(I 4 I 2 means that if user visit I 4 health and fitness then he will visit I 2 birth and adoption\ with large possibility C 1  Items count I 1 6 I 2 7 I 3 6 I 4 2 I 5 2  Scanning D Counting Com p a r in g wit h  Min _ su p  L 1  Items count I 1  6 I 2  7 I 3  6 I 4  2 I 5  2 C 2  Items count I 1 I 2 4 I 1 I 3 4 I 1 I 4 1 I 1 I 5 2 I 2 I 3 4 I 2 I 4 2 I 2 I 5 2 I 3 I 4 0 I 3 I 5 1 I 4 I 5 0  Scanning D Counting L 2  Items count I 1 I 2 4 I 1 I 3 4 I 1 I 5 2 I 2 I 3 4 I 2 I 4 2 I 2 I 5 2 Comparing with Min_sup C 3  Items count I 1 I 2 I 3  2 I 1 I 2 I 5  2 Scanning D Counting L 3  Items count I 1 I 2 I 3  2 I 1 I 2 I 5  2 Comparing with Min_sup 


With the same method, Rules can be drawn out from{I 1 I 2  I 5 as shown in Tab3 TABLE 3  A SSOCIATION RULES FROM I 1   I 2   I 5  No. Rules Confidence 1 { I 1 I 2  I 5 2/4= 50 2 { I 1 I 5  I 2 2 /2= 100 3 { I 2 I 5  I 1 2 /2= 100 4 { I 1  I 2 I 5 2 /6= 33 5 { I 2  I 1 I 5 2 /7= 29 6 { I 5  I 1 I 2 2 /2= 100  According to the minimal confidence, only three rules \({ I 1  I 5  I 2 I 2 I 5  I 1 I 5  I 1 I 2 are useful rules shown as Tab4 TABLE 4  U SEFUL A SSOCIATION RULES FROM I 1   I 2   I 5  No. Rules Confidence 2 { I 1 I 5  I 2 2 /2= 100 3 { I 2 I 5  I 1 2 /2= 100 6 { I 5  I 1 I 2 2 /2= 100  Rule 2 \({ I 1 I 5  I 2 means that if user visit I 1 maternity insurance\nd I 5 population and family planing commision then he will visit I 2 birth and adoption\ with large possibility Rule 3 \({ I 2 I 5  I 1 means that if user visit I 2 birth and adoption\nd I 5 population and family planing commision then he will visit I 1 maternity insurance\ with large possibility Rule 6 \({I 5  I 1 I 2 eans that if user visit I 5 population and family planing commision\then he will visit I 1 maternity insurance\nd I 2 birth and adoption\  with large possibility Based on the above rules, e-government can provide for users personalized information with additional dynamical recommending message. For example, when website of health and fitness is visited, e-government can recommend website of birth and adoption to users. The similar recommending information can also be made out easily According to association rules mining, e-government can give users the clue of some usefule recommending information which users are interesting in. This can make users filt more convinently and save more time        R EFERENCES   1  Deloitte Research – Public Sector Institute, At the Dawn of eGovernment: The Citizen as Customer, 2000 2  Kaylor, C., Deshazo, R. and Van Eck, D.

Whereas Xu et. al proved the redundancy of rules having different conclusion parts, we assume that the conclusion part of rules is identical for redundancy theorem from the viewpoint of application in this study Theorem 1: Let X ?

On the contrary, the non redundant rule has maximum value of CF among the subset fuzzy association rules from Theorem 3. Fig.l shows the conceptual diagram of the redundant rule and the non redundant rule The objective of association rules mining becomes to find the fuzzy association rules that are non-redundant and satisfY traditional confidence and support conditions. Clearly we can calculate the redundancy and prune the redundant rules after 


mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV.

V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ?

Y strong redundant rule Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes\(items consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items\( k>2 When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
