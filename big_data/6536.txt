But still majority of panoramic view is only implemented to capture wide angle scenery or a three-dimensional model In this paper a cloud computing service and its application for data synchronization with multiple cameras has been presented. This service has been implemented using image extracted data transferring without multiple devices for synchronization.  For image data analysis a dedicated application is developed with single capture device and each data will be sent to server for image processing computation The goal of this research is to provide a better image data synchronization which perform a faster real-time panoramic view and analyze human tracking information precisely In this system multiple cameras were used with image data synchronization to get panoramic view and performing human de tection from each panoramic view frames The system is setup with multiple camera connected with few computer where each of them sending image direct to cloud server and one of machine will be retrieving all image contents directly from cloud server for information mapping image stitching and computation part. For better performance different cloud server has been used to analyze data transferring size speed, computation time with different features tracking method Finally this paper concludes with a system which can be specially use in wide are view for multiple capture devices This system can be used in various systems which can help in vehicle safety system as well as wide are human detection  Index Terms 000  Cloud Computing Human Tracking Image Processing  information mapping and data synchronization I  I NTRODUCTION  After release of panoramic view in  camera this elongated fields of view technology and algorithms has not been fully utilizes in industrial area commercial systems painting and mobile devices such as smart phones and portable computers Majority of the panoramic view was only implemented to capture wide angle scenery or a three-dimensional model such as some work by Christian Schönauer 1   to capture wide area motion tacking with 3d depth sensor On other side Yu Jin Hong, Jae-In Hwang, Sun-Bum Youn Sang Chul Ahn Hyung-Gon Kim Heedong Ko 3  u s ed  interactive panorama video viewer with head algorithms J Segen and S Kumar 4  u s es a co n tr o ll e d  b ac k g r o u n d  to  localize the hand efficiently in real-time.

free of maintenance Majority of cloud are currently cloud database and data storing cloud 12   The main goal of this research is to provide a better and faster method for image data synchronization through multiple real-time panoramic camera capture in the most efficient way with using cloud server included human tracking at the end results The system separated into three parts where the first part is multiple camera capture with computation of panoramic view frames. Each panoramic frame is sending to cloud server  The second part will be retrieving all images from cloud server with computation of overall full panoramic view. Last part will be human tracking and position in the full panoramic view frames Several methods has been analyzed and compare through during panoramic computation such as FAST Features Detection SURF Features Detection and Harris Corners Detection Where else different cloud server has been tested and compared such as Google Drive Dropbox Microsoft Skydrive, Amazon Cloud Drive and Olleh Ucloud In this study human tracking in real-time camera capture with wide angle view computation through cloud system is further implemented which enable the credibility of human detection, human interaction or vehicles safety system II  S YSTEM DESIGN  A  System Overview  Fig ure.1 shows the overall structure for this system. At first we capture wide-angle image for each two HD webcam which is connected to PC   Figure 1. System Structure  These photos will be stitched and used as source of panoramic image. In order to send the panoramic image from each computer to same cloud server computed panoramic image will be label. Overall, a main PC will be functioning as result output PC to download each image from cloud server from time to time and stitching all panoramic images into one whole complete panoramic image At the same time human location tracking result will be generated in the main PC as well  B  Panoramic View  To generate a panoramic image, this system is computed in different feature detection methods which are FAST Features Detection 13-15   SUR F F ea tu r es Det ec ti o n   1 6   and Harris Corners Detection 20-21  to  c o m p ar e an d  an aly ze  t h e  fastest and the most precise image stitching results. Each of the detection method will computed a homography that maps the relation in between images. Different features detection method will compute different type of mapping result and computation performance  1  FAST Features Detection  FAST Features from Accelerated Segment Test featu re s algorithm derives from definition of what constitutes a 000³\000F\000R\000U\000Q\000H\000U\000´\000\021\000\003 As show in Figure 2 FAST method is based on image intensity around a putative feature point. The key point is gain by examining a circle of pixels centered at a candidate point. When an arc of contiguous points of length greater than 3/4 of circle perimeter is found in which all pixels significantly differ from the intensity of the center point, then a key point is declared This algorithm result in very fast interest point detection and should be used when speed is a concern    Figure 2. FAST Features Detection  2  SURF Features Detection  SURF Speed up Robust Features features as show in Fi gure 3 which is the scale-invariant features that has been introduced in computer vision SURF not only scale-invariant features but they also benefit in efficiently computation The ISBN 978-89-968650-3-2 1119 February 16~19, 2014 ICACT2014 


circles of detected key points change in size is proportional to the scale change   Figure 3. SURF Features Detection  To detect the features, the Hessian matrix is computed at each pixel This matrix measures the local curvature of a function and is defined as    1  3  Harris Corners Detection  Harris looks at the average directional intensity change in small window around a putative interest point   2  The average intensity change can then be computed in all possible directions which lead to the definition of a corner as a point for which the average change is high in more than one direction Harris is obtained with the direction of maximal average intensity change. If the average intensity change in the orthogonal direction is also high then we will have a corner point as in Figure 3.1   Figure 3.1 Harris Corners Detection  Once the interest point in Harris Corners has been detected Accord.NET image stitching library has been use to perform Correlation matching robust homography estimation and gradient blending Correlation matching method will be measure and matching the interest point extracted from Harris Corners method Given a set of correlation points there allow to pair the points in between two images as show in Figure 3.2   Fi gure 3.2. Correlation points Paring  Next will be Robust Homography Estimation which using RANSAC for fitting a homography matrix. A robust estimator of RANSAC will generate a homography matrix from previous set of correlation feature points RANSAC is actually an 000D\000E\000E\000U\000H\000Y\000L\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003 000I\000R\000U\000\003 000³\0005\000$\0001\000G\000R\000P\000\003 0006\000D\000P\000S\000O\000H\000\003 000&\000R\000Q\000V\000H\000Q\000V\000X\000V\000´\000\017\000\003 000Z\000K\000L\000F\000K\000\003 000L\000V\000\003 000D\000Q\000\003 iterative method for robust parameter estimation to fit mathematical models from sets of observed data points which may contain outliers RANSAC works by trying to fit several models using some of the point pairs and then checking if the models were able to relate most of the points as show in Figure 3.3 as below   Fi gure 3.3. RANSAC estimator result  4  Homography Matrix The above methods are being used to extract feature points for homography computation, where the homography matrix is matching two images A homography is a projective transformation a kind of transformation used in projective geometry. It describes what happens to the perceived positions of observed objects when the point of view of observer changes In others terms a homography is an invertible transformation from the real projective plane to the projective plane that maps straight lines to straight lines ISBN 978-89-968650-3-2 1120 February 16~19, 2014 ICACT2014 


By using homogeneous coordinates, which can represent a homography matrix as a 3x3 matrix with 8 degrees of freedom  3  Homogenous coordinates are very useful because they w ill allow the system to perform an image projective transformation by using only standard matrix multiplication, as shown by the equation and schematic diagrams above Once all the projected points have been computed The original coordinate system is recovered by dividing each point by its homogenous scale parameter and then dropping the scale factor which after division will be set at 1 Result which following table showing is average of 30 set data with different execution time by different detection method TABLE  1 F EATURE D ETECTION M ETHOD WITH E XECUTION T IME AND Q UANTITY OF F EATURE P OINTS R ESULT  en-GB feature detection methods  Average Execution Time   millisecond   FAST Feature Detection  449.667  SURF Feature Detection  334.033  Harris Corner Detect ion  1364.800   Homography matrix that has been computed which allow our system to perform Blending of two images from Accord.NET library The system is using a linear gradient alpha blending from the center of one image to the other Gradient blending works by simulating a gradual change in one 000L\000P\000D\000J\000H\000¶\000V\000\003\000D\000O\000S\000K\000D\000\003\000F\000K\000D\000Q\000Q\000H\000O\000\003\000R\000Y\000H\000U\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000O\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000Z\000K\000L\000F\000K\000\003\000F\000R\000Q\000Q\000H\000F\000W\000V\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000F\000H\000Q\000W\000H\000U\000V\000\003 of two images as show in Figure 4 and Figure 5   Figure 4.

The general layout can be seen in Figs 9 and 10 When designing the HUD it was important to display all of the required information without impeding the subject's fov This was achieved by placing the

environment 050i.e MATLAB and Simulink\051 however the minimum surface distance calculation is done in EDGE through the use of a user-written plug-in The plugin generates an octree representation of a given stl 002le The algorithm used to calculate the minimum surface distance from the Jetpack to the asteroid's surface exploits the octree representation used to describe the complex shape of the asteroid An octree representation is the three-dimensional analog of a quadtree An octree is a tree data structure whose internal nodes have eight children Each node is recursively subdivided as an axis-aligned bounding box 050AABB\051 whose space is determined by the eight parts that are created from subdividing the parent node's space The child node can either become another internal node containing eight children or a leaf node that contains the actual items being stored in the octree 050i.e triangles\051 The number of levels is determined by the depth of the algorithm which is a user-de\002ned parameter For instance Figure 11 shows the division of the root node into its eight children who are then in turn subdivided into another eight children This particular example has a depth of two since there were two subdivisions of a parent node The algorithm used to calculate the minimum distance from the Jetpack COM to Itokawa uses a depth of four A depth of four is chosen because only the surface of the asteroid was modeled and not any internal features which allowed a depth of four to accurately map the surface of the model Figure 11 226 Octree Recursion Setup Octrees are particularly useful for recursive minimum distance algorithms The following pseudo-code shows how the algorithm calculates the minimum distance from the Jetpack to the asteroid surface There are two functions used which have been adopted from These algorithms calculate the minimum distance from a point to an AABB and from a point to a triangle The surface of Itokawa has been modeled using a triangular mesh therefore the minimum distance between the MAJIC COM and the surface can be found by minimizing the distance between a point 050Jetpack COM\051 and a triangle 050surface\051 This algorithm is extremely ef\002cient because it exploits the recursive data structure of the octree A plug-in contains the algorithm which has two generic functions InitializePlugin and UpdateScene InitialiazePlugin is called once at start up to initialize plug-in parameters The plug-in can be passed command line arguments which can then be assigned to various parameters such as a node names UpdateScene is is executed each time EDGE displays a new scene Therefore anytime a new scene is displayed the contents of that function are executed The algorithm assigns the current 050 x y z 051 values of the Jetpack COM to the array pos then calls the function closestP tP ointT riangles  ho we v er  one of the ar guments for that function is the output of the function f indClosestOctreeN ode  which is detailed in Algorithm 3.2 The algorithm receives a pointer to a top-level octree and position vector Since an octree parent has eight children nodes the algorithm traverses the array of children and searches for the AABB with the minimum distance to the position vector Once the child with the minimum distance has been selected the algorithm checks to determine if the new minimum branch is a leaf node 050no children\051 If the new minimum branch is a leaf node the code returns a pointer to the new minimum branch The new minimum branch contains a structure of triangles that describe the topology of the asteroid If the new minimum branch is not a leaf the algorithm recursively calls itself with the new minimum branch as the top-level oc7

is 1.39 kg and the mean associated with the treatment group using the thrusters-only ACS is 2.49 kg The computed Fvalue is 16.96 which corresponds to an experimental p-value of p  3  91 002 10 000 4  Since the experimental p-value is much less than the signi\002cance threshold one can say that the data shows a statistically signi\002cant difference between the two control modes in fuel consumption This extremely low p-value is indicative of a statistical fuel savings associated with using a blended control mode This result makes physical sense because CMGs use only electrical power for maneuvering Therefore when the CMGs are being used to control attitude no thrusters are being 002red which implies that no fuel is being consumed Rejecting the null hypothesis supports the idea that a blended control mode can provide the user with a comparable experience at an average fuel savings of 45 and a maximum of 84 shown in Table 3 Table 3 226 Fuel Consumption Data Control Mode  Subject Combined RCS Only j Fuel Saved j 050kg\051 050kg\051 050%\051  1 3.07 3.49 11.89 2 0.60 1.97 69.66 3 1.32 1.81 26.89 4 1.26 1.83 31.05 5 0.65 1.88 65.65 6 0.46 2.92 84.22 7 1.14 2.91 60.88 8 1.73 3.14 44.91 9 1.19 2.29 48.02 10 1.19 2.58 53.98 11 2.32 2.81 17.17 12 2.33 2.78 16.13 13 0.83 1.94 57.31 The electrical power required by the batteries would come from a rechargeable source and could be used on several missions Also by 002ne tuning the gains to a speci\002c astronaut's choosing the system can be highly adaptable as far as work platform stiffness response time desired overshoot The CMGs provide a continuous control mechanism compared to the discrete on-off times of the thrusters and can eliminate errors associated with attitude or pointing requirements whereas a thrusters-only ACS can only work within the limits of a particular deadband set by the control system As a result the combined control mode provides a much smoother response to attitude disturbances than the thrusters Figure 14 shows box plots with the 002rst second 050median\051 and third quartiles of the data as well as the minimum and maximum On the left are the results from the combined ACS while on the right are the results from the RCS only ACS Figure 14 demonstrates that the entire 002rst through third quartiles of the combined ACS are below the 002rst quartile of the RCS thrusters only ACS Figure 15 plots the fuel consumption data for both control modes for each of the subjects The fuel consumption data reveals many interesting things such as the variation between subjects on the amount of fuel needed for the same control mode 050i.e subject 1 and subject 3 use a different amount of fuel for the RCS only control mode\051 Also the data shows that there is always a reduction in fuel used when switching Figure 14 226 Fuel Consumption Box Plot Figure 15 226 Plot of Fuel Consumption vs Subject 050Both Control Modes\051 between the RCS only control mode and the combined control mode 050the difference between the vertical lines\051 5 C ONCLUSION The use of real-time visualization software for simulation validation and testing is an extremely bene\002cial tool The graphics can provide insight into the behavior of the system During the initial setup actual thruster plume models were used to show which thrusters were being commanded by the ACS The observed behavior of the jets facilitated the veri\002cation of the DCM transformation between the Jetpack's body and asteroid's ACI coordinates Also the incorporation of graphics gave a more robust complete feeling to the simulation environment Pairing the graphics component with the VR Lab hardware 050helmet gloves 6-DoF electromagnetic tracking etc.\051 produced an immersive environment for algorithm testing since the subject could actually sit down and feel as if he/she were piloting the actual Jetpack system Current work already under progress and future work include modifying the simulation for various CMG architectures modeling CMG power consumption and selecting an optimal CMG size based on parametrically varying CMG parameters 050i.e 003ywheel speed 003ywheel inertia and gimbal rate\051 and a Monte Carlo sim framework Overall the combined ACS proved to be the preference of the 10 


human subjects Also from a design standpoint the combined control mode is also the preferred choice CMGs use electrical power which in turn reduces overall fuel consumption and extends mission life with the same given amount of propellant CMGs also are a continuous control actuator and therefore achieve a much 002ner pointing resolution than the thruster's discrete control actuator model By varying the control system gains one can create a much stiffer work platform and/or a faster response time depending upon the particular preference of the user Including four CMGs in a pyramid con\002guration provides a level of redundancy while also simplifying the steering law A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank NASA Johnson Space Center and in particular the VR Lab for their gracious support and help during this effort The members of the VR Lab helped with overall EDGE design and interface requirements They also helped with initial setup hardware integration and testing of the pre-existing hardware This work was supported by the Draper Laboratory Internal Research and Development 050IR&D\051 program We are very grateful for the support and acknowledgment from our Draper colleagues R EFERENCES   B Chapman A Crenshaw A Guertin and C Gwennap 0502013\051 A v ailable http://poe.olin.edu/poe2013/s  engr2210groundbots/Mechanical  Subsystem.html   N S Bedrossian J Paradiso E V Bergmann and D Rowell 223Redundant single gimbal control moment gyroscope singularity analysis,\224 Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics  vol 13 pp 1096\2261101 1990   M Jackson and R D McDonald 223Draper simulation analysis tool 050dsat\051 Graphical object simulation techniques and tools for simulink,\224 in AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference and Exhibit  Providence Rhode Island Aug 2004   M.Carpenter B Cohanim K Duda J Rize C Dopart J Hoffman K Jackson and et al 223Next-generation maneuvering system with control-moment gyroscopes for extravehicular activities near low-gravity objects,\224 in AIAA International Conference on Environmental Systems  Vail Colorado Jul 2013   Metecs 0502010\051 Onli A v ailable http://www.metecs.com/products-edge.php   J Harrington 0502013\051 Available http://www.ascensiontech.com/realtime/rt\003ockofbirds.php   C Ericson Real-Time Collision Detection  New York NY Focal Press 2005   R Winkler and W Hays Statistics Probability Inference and Decision 0502nd edition\051  New York NY Holt Rinehart and Winston 1975 B IOGRAPHY  Jared Rize received his B.S in Mechanical Engineering 050Aerospace concentration\051 in 2012 from Lehigh University He is currently an M.S student in Aeronautical/Astronautical Engineering at MIT He is currently a Draper Laboratory Fellow at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge MA His current research activities include design and development of control laws for spacecraft or space vehicles with blended attitude control actuators Michele Carpenter is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory She received a B.S in Astrophysics from UCLA in 2002 and a Ph.D in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University in 2009 Her Ph.D research focused on the dynamics and control of gyroscopically actuated space robotic systems At Draper she specializes in Guidance Navigation and Control algorithm development and analysis for strategic and space programs Prior to her graduate work she spent two years working in the Ballistic Missile Defense division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory Bobby Cohanim is the Mission Design Group Leader and a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory He joined Draper Laboratory in September 2006 He has led several space and autonomy R&D efforts while at Draper Before coming to Draper Bobby also worked at JPL He received his B.S from Iowa State University in Aerospace Engineering 0502002\051 his S.M in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502004\051 and ScD in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502013\051 Jeffrey Hoffman is Professor of the Practice of Aerospace Engineering in the Aero/Astro Department at MIT He received a B.A in Astronomy from Amherst College 0501966\051 a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Harvard 11

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
