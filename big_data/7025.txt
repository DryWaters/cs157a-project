The Optimization and Improvement of the Apriori Algorithm  Yiwu Xie, Yutong Li, Chunli Wang, Mingyu Lu Information Science Technology Department Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, 116026, China dearliyutong@163.com   Abstract  Through the study of Apriori algorithm we discover two aspects that affect the e fficiency of the algorithm. One is the frequent scanning database, the other is large scale of the candidate itemsets. Therefore, IApriori algorithm is proposed that can reduce the times of scanning database optimize the join procedure of frequent itemsets generated in order to reduce the size of the candidate itemsets. The 
results show that the algorithm is better than Apriori algorithm  1. Introduction  Data mining also known as the knowledge discovery in database, it is a forecasting method to extract the hidden knowledge from the large-scale database or the data warehouse 1 Its main methods include: classification clustering, association analysis and so on 2 Mining association rules is one of the main contents of data mining research at present and emphasis particularly is finding the relation of different items in database. Apriori 
3 is the most famous and basic method in mining association rules. The principle of Apriori algorithm is to find the valuable association rules whose support and confidence must satisfy the minimum support and confidence confirmed by user aforehand  2. Apriori algorithm description  Apriori algorithm is the most effective method that candidate k+1-itemsets may be generated from frequent k-itemsets according to the nature of Apriori algorithm that any subset of frequent itemsets are all frequent 
itemsets. The classical Apriori algorithm  L 1 large 1-itemsets for \(k=2; L k-1  k++\in C k apriori-gen\(L k-1  new candidate itemsets generated for all transactions t  D do begin C t subset\(C k t transaction t contains in the candidate itemsets for all candidates c  C t do c.count end L 
k c  C k c.count  minsup end Answer k L k   First, find the frequent 1-itemsets L 1 L 2 is generated from L 1 and so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found and then algorithm ceases. In the algorithm each L k generated must scan database one time 5-7 Second, C k  is generated from L 
k-1 Every itemset in C k is tested whether its all k-1 subsets constitute a large k-1 itemset or not. Therefore, scanning large database many times and generating so many useless candidate itemsets are the bottleneck of the Apriori algorithm  3. Problem description  Apriori algorithm has three shortcomings below  First, because there are lots of transactions in the database, computing the frequencies of candidate itemsets must scan database frequently and spend much more time Second, C 
k is generated by joining two frequent itemsets that belong to L k-1 If we can reduce the operating frequencies, we can improve the efficiency of Apriori algorithm. Third, the expending in time and space for frequent itemsets is too much. For example, if we have 10 4 frequent 1-itemsets, we can get 10 7 frequent 2itemsets. So reducing the scale of C k can improve the efficiency of the Apriori algorithm greatly Therefore, it is necessary to delete the useless 
transactions in the database in order to reduce the scale of database and reduce itemsets generated from C k by the join procedure. This paper presents an improved Apriori algorithm called IApriori algorithm according to the analysis of   Apriori algorithm above  4. Improved apriori algorithm  Improved Apriori algorithm related in [9 s  database to compute the frequencies of candidate itemsets at the same time to mark the deleting tag if the size of

In [10, 11 sactio n  t d o e s  not contain any element of candidate itemsets C k the algorithm determines to mark the deleting tag on t, so we can skip over the record in next database scanning. The method that reduces the operating frequencies generating C k by joining two frequent itemsets that belong to L k-1 is proposed in T h e i m prov e m e n t i n 13] l i m i t s t h e s cal e  m+n \ of  C k in advance according to the numbers of rules that contain the total items which are respectively m and n Due to the generalization of algorithm, IApriori algorithm proposed in this paper does not input more thresholds to improve efficiency, only has improved from some aspects 1\provement method of optimizing the join procedure to reduce the size of candidate itemsets. When C k+1 is generated from L k  L k each item of the first L k is joining with every item in the second L k in classical Apriori algorithm. Since the k th item of the first L k is the same as the k th item of the second one, the k th item of the first L k is joining with the k+1 th item of the second one when C k+1 is generated from L k  L k Only in this way can we spend less time than before For example: L 1 I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 Apriori algorithm needs computing 16\(4*4\times but it only needs 6\(3+2+1\imes in IApriori algorithm 2\Improvement method of reducing the scale of database. Through the process obtaining C k+1 from L k if the size of transaction t is less than k, we can say that it is useless for generating C k+1 if transaction t does not contain any subset of candidate itemsets C k mark the transaction t the deleting tag IApriori algorithm reduces the scale of database and optimizes the join procedure, so it improves the efficiency of algorithm greatly Moreover, the scale of L 1 must be small as soon as possible to reduce the scale of C 2 C 3 and so on. Make sure the proper minsupport; also we can choose interested items for the frequent itemsets generated IApriori algorithm is described as follows  1  L 1 large 1-itemsets 2  for \(k=2; L k-1  k 3   4  C k apriori-gen\(L k-1  generate new candidate itemsets 5  for all transactions t  D  and  t.delete=0 6   7  if  t.count<k  then if the size of transaction t is less than k, t is useless for C k generated 8  t.delete=1 mark t the deleting tag to skip over the record in next database scanning 9  else 10   11  C t subset\(C k t candidate itemsets contained in transcaion t 12  if  C t   then if t does not contain any subset of candidate itemsets C k mark the deleting tag 13  t.delete=1 14  else 15   16  for all candidates c  C t  17  c.count 18   19   20   21  L k c  C k c.count  minsup 22   23  Answer k L k   To implement the improvement, IApriori algorithm is described as follow steps 1\ the database to get C 1 make sure the proper minsupport to get frequent itemset L 1 k=1 2\erate C k+1 though joining two frequent itemsets that belong to L k The m th item in the first L k should join with the m+1 th item of the second L k  3\If the size of transaction t is less than k, we give transaction t to mark the deleting tag; if not, compute C t  that contains subsets of candidate itemsets C k in transaction t 4\Judge whether t comprises any subset of C k if not compute the frequencies of C k Otherwise, mark t the deleting tag 5\dd item of C k to L k+1 if the support of the item is greater than minsupport 6\ L k+1   the algorithm ceases. Otherwise k=k+1, continue to the second step in circle until L k+1     5. IApriori algorithm performance test  To analyse the relative performance of the IApriori and Apriori algorithms, we use a small part data from real store database stored 10000 transactions. Figure 1 demonstrates the relative performance of these algorithms. Five experiments are carried out accomplished using the same database with different minimum support factors. The experiment is in WindowsXP Professional operating system, CPU with Intel \(R\Hz, memory with 512MB, the algorithm language used in C Experiments results show that the time needed IApriori algorithm is less than Apriori algorithm under the same support condition. So we can have the conclusion that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Apriori algorithm in computational time

results show that excluding itemset supports below minsup generally has little effect on clustering results particular for smaller values of minsup However there is some degradation in metric values for higher levels of minsup Here 223degradation\224 means that metric values are smaller when some itemset supports are excluded corresponding to a poorer clustering match to frequent itemsets We offer the following interpretation for the minsup dependent degradation in clustering metric Members of frequent itemsets are typically frequently cited documents overall Such frequently cited documents are likely to appear in many itemsets even less frequent itemsets Thus there are likely to be many itemsets below minsup that contain these frequently cited documents Excluding itemsets below minsup then removes the supports that these itemsets contribute to the summations in computing hybrid distances 5 Summary and Conclusions We have proposed a new methodology for visualizing association mining results A central component in the methodology is a new class of inter-item distances computed directly from itemset supports While the distances are computed from supports of itemsets of arbitrary cardinality they still retain a simple pairwise structure These hybrid pairwisehigher-cardinality distances thus allow the direct application of standard visualization tools such as clustering dendrograms However they require much less complex user interaction compared to that of working directly with all frequent itemsets The hybrid distances are computationally feasible via fast algorithms for computing frequent itemsets We provided a theoretical guarantee that under the new hybrid distances consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets is attainable independent of the clustering criterion We proposed the application of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram for association mining visualization which enables quick comprehension of complex distance relationships among items We also introduced new augmentations of the dendrogram to support the visual mining process by adding item descriptive text and graphical symbols for members of frequent itemsets We tested the effects of our new hybrid distances on hierarchical clustering dendrograms for large numbers of test cases with data extracted from the Science Citation Index In particular we compared dendrograms between a variety of hybrid distance formulas and standard pairwise distances in terms of a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets For the majority of the test cases metric values were higher for our hybrid distances indicating better consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets We also conducted experiments showing that excluding itemset supports below some minimum value has relatively little effect on itemset/cluster consistency so that it is reasonable to apply fast algorithms for computing the frequent itemsets needed for the hybrid distances This is the first known application of clustering for the visualizing association mining results The pairwise structure of the new hybrid inter-item distances allows the visualization of frequent itemsets of arbitrary cardinalities The nonlinear transformation of itemset supports helps ensure consistency between clusters and important frequent itemsets making frequent itemsets less likely to be obscured during visualization As a more basic contribution this work represents a first step towards the unification of association mining and clustering visualization 6 References l M Henzinger 223Link Analysis in Web Information Retrieval,\224 Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering 23 special issue on Next-Generation Web Search pp 3-8 September 2000  J Kleinberg, \223Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment,\224 in Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms January 1998, pp 3 H Small 223Co-citation in the Scientific Literature A New Measure of the Relationship Between Two Documents,\224 Journal of the American Society of Information Science 24 pp. 265-269, 1973 4 J Hartigan Clustering Algorithms John Wiley  Sons New York, 1975 5 R Agrawal T Imielinski A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 in Proceedings of the 1993 International Conference on the Management of Data Washington DC, May 1993, pp. 207-216 161 R Agrawal R Srikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules,\224 in Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile September 1994, pp. 487-499 7 E Garfield Citation Index Its Theory and Application in Science Technology and Humanities John Wiley  Sons New York, 1979 8 H Small 223Macro-Level Changes in the Structure of Co-Citation Clusters 1983-1989,\224 Scientometrics 26 pp 5-20 1993 668-677 432 


which works off the circumstance lattice sweeping it level wise and is very expensive as well In the full paper we develop efficient algorithms for computing the Armstrong Basis suppressed here for lack of space 7 Discussion and Conclusions Recently there has been interest in mining long pattern s In this context algorithms for mining maximal frequent sets have been proposed Bay98 AAPOO This is relevant because of our interest in minimal circumstances However these algorithms operate in a different lattice and the mech anisms of the algorithms appear different Given our interest in the Armstrong Basis, these algorithms might offer yet an other way to efficiently find maximal frequent itemsets as sociated with a circumstance in that context The recent ly proposed FP-tree method HPYOO PHMOO has obvious relevance for circumstance mining and also for the compu tation of the Armstrong Basis We are currently exploring efficient algorithms for the Armstrong Basis based on the FP-tree method Finally as previously noted mining for cir cumstances in which a given pattern \(like frequent itemset holds has a close relationship with cube computation For lack of space we refer the reader to the recent paper BR99 which surveys many of the cube methods and which also describes the BUC algorithm In conclusion basing pattern mining on a clear sepa ration between item attributes and circumstance attributes pays its dividends the close ties with the cube computa tion paradigm and between cube computation and mining of i-anti-monotone patterns open up new and promising di rections for future work As motivated earlier, finding mini mal for c-monotone patterns circumstances under which a pattern holds for a specific itemset is useful in its own right The framework developed in this paper goes far beyondjust support-based mining of frequent itemsets This is achieved using properties of patterns on the bilattice of circumstances and itemsets Finally we proposed a useful notion of Arm strong Basis with which we can find \(say minimal circum stances where a pattern holds for an itemset and then find which other itemsets satisfy the pattern under these circum stances This is in the spirit of mining the result of min ing one of the important problems identified by Imielinski and Mannila in their seminal paper ImMa96 Just as data cube is an important operator for supporting queries involv ing multiple group-bys for queries involving migration be tween itemsets and circumstances Armstrong Basis can pro vide effective support More work is needed for its efficient computation and its use in answering such mining queries AS951 AAPOO R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining sequential pattem s ICDE\22295 pp 3-14 R Agrawal C C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad Depth first generation of long pattems KDD 2000 to appear R J Bayardo Efficiently mining long pattems from databases SIGMOD 22198 pp 85-93 K S Beyer, R Ramakrishnan: Bottom-Up Computa tion of Sparse and Iceberg CUBES SIGMOD 22299 pp S Brin R Motwani, and C.

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
