The mass instrumentation\nof the planet and society is providing intelligence that is not\nonly enhancing our personal lives, but also opening up new\nopportunities for addressing some of key environmental, social\nand economic challenges of the 21st century. Unfortunately, as\nwith all technology, there is the potential for misuse; in the case\nof personal data the ability to gather, enrich and mine at extreme\npace and volume could result in societal-scale privacy intrusions.\nWe apply a model for identity across cyber and physical spaces\nto the question of risk control for personal-data in the context of\nbig data analytics. Using a graphical model for identity we re?ect\non the response options we have and how such risk controls may\nor may not be effective.\nIndex Terms—privacy; big-data; society; personal-data; risk\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSociety is continuing to increase its exploitation of cy-\nberspace as an arena in which to both work and play resulting\nin a production and consumption of data on a huge scale. The\neconomic value of cyberspace is signi?cant \(and increasingly\nso  important across all the leading\neconomies of the world. As the developing world joins the\nInternet it is predicted that cyberspace will become a key\nenabler for these economies too.\nThe mass instrumentation of the natural and man-made\nworld, enabled by cyberspace, is offering new intelligence and\nunderstanding into the complex systems which pervade, in?u-\nence and control our environments. This in turn is providing\nus with new opportunities for addressing the challenges facing\nmankind in the 21st century – from the better predication of\nweather systems and understanding climate change, farming\nand feeding a fast growing global population, to more ef?cient\ntransport strategies in urban areas and the planning for global\nmarket stability. In the near term, cyberspace is offering\nopportunities for ef?ciencies in citizen services and bene?ts\ncrucial to many austerity strategies and it is underpinning a\nrevolution in community and society through its opening up\nof information access. For many, cyberspace is likely to offer\nthe route out of austerity and into prosperity There is little\ndoubt that cyberspace is a force for good in the world.\nAs society continues to exploit and rely on cyberspace we\n?nd ourselves changing our understanding of what is meant by\nidentity – what de?nes us as us. In order to reap the bene?ts\noffered by cyberspace, and in particular the instrumentation of\nour environments, we need to share data, lots of data. Each\ntime we engage in cyberspace we generate and use some\nform of data - whether it is metadata, wrapped around our\ntransactions and interactions, or whether it is the content or\nexplicit data we share and consume. This data can be collected,\naggregated, mined and correlated in order to generate new\ninsights and predictions – this in turn creates more data.\nIn many cases the predictive power of Big Data analytics\nis so good that it is possible to know people better than\nthey appear to know themselves; predictions can be made\nabout a persons likely preferences and onward choices that are\naccurate and at times the individual would not be conscious of\nsuch preferences – giving the appearance of, or producing the\nreality of, the technology knowing them better than they know\nthemselves. Most people interact in cyberspace without paying\ntoo much consideration to the Big Data analytics operating in\nthe background in order to provide the services they utilise.\nHowever, once the actualality of the insights and predictive\ncapabilities are made tangible to them many people become\nill-at-ease; there is a feeling that this may not be desirable,\nalthough typically they cannot formulate why they are uneasy\nwith the situation. We re?ect on the question of risk and\nwhether there is a reason to be concerned about the apparant\nloss of privacy we must bear in order to adopt these services.\nWe consider the threat to people from exposing personal\ndata in cyberspace in the face of Big Data analytics, and how\npersonal data exposures in cyberspace can enable sophisticated\nmodels of personae to be created which may be undesirable\nin the face of such threats. We explore a graphical model of\nidentity and what that might tell us about the controls we might\nadopt to manage such risks. Finally, we consider a range of\noptions for mitigating the risks associated with such exposure\nof personal data.\nThis paper continues in Section II by considering the\nincreasing risks around personal data, Section III describes the\ncomplexity and fragility of identity with Section IV presenting\na graphical view of identity, and in Section V we discuss the\npolicy options for societal management of Big Data in the\nface of such risks. The paper concludes in Section VI with a\ndiscussion of the future research direction.\nII. INCREASING RISKS AROUND PERSONAL DATA\nThere is much research and product-development concerned\nwith identity, personal data and associated analytics, whether\ncommercially through targeted marketing \(e.g. [2 e.g. [3 e.g. [4 or\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 613\nto support an investigative viewpoint. However, as with any\nexpansion into new territory we face a new set of risks.\nThe 


level of personal data \(data that in some way provides\ninsight into a person and how they live aggregated\nand created by Big Data analytics is exceptionally large, with\nlittle new or tailored governance around it. This means that\nin many cases the standard website data handling terms and\nconditions apply – often allowing the service provider free\nreign with regards to data processing and onward sharing.\nTypically the ownership of data resulting from aggregation and\nprocessing is with the organization creating such data, and not\nwith the person whose data was the origin and whose persona\nor identity is being enriched by such processes. This is crucial\nto underpinning the Big Data ecosystem, where supply chains\nof data processors purchasers and handlers exist to support\nthe growing industry. However, the power of the Big Data\nanalytics combined with the lack of control that individuals\nhave once they have shared their data, is likely to increase the\nrisks that individuals and potentially the organisations handling\nsuch data face.\nIn considering the risks around big personal data we\nadopt the classi?cation scheme of Rose [5]: location-based\ninformation oversharing and risks through direct disclosure,\ninformation aggregation and risk-by-design. Risk-by-design is\nlargely unchanged by a Big Data paradigm, as we might expect\nthe systems supporting Big Data analytical environments to\nbe no more likely to suffer such risks than any other digital\nsystem. However, the other risks are increased as soon as we\nconsider a Big Data context. In each of the examples below\nthere are undeniably threats to individual members of society\nthrough the unmanaged sharing of information, however Big\nData platforms \(including both technical platforms and indi-\nvidual analytics methods of these\nattacks on a societal-scale previously unavailable. The ability\nto aggregate, enrich, mine and most importantly act on very\nweak signals in Internet-scale data can enable a very powerful\nset of actions:\nA. Risk associated with oversharing and direct disclosure\nIn 2010 a couple posted on their social networking site\nthat they would not be at home on a particular evening\nand then were robbed by two of their friends [6 Reports\nindicated that this was likely to have been a planned event\nseeking to exploit the intelligence that can be gleaned from\ntaking trusted positions in social networks; an example of\nhow oversharing interactions in cyberspace can cause a vul-\nnerability in physical-space. Whilst this appears to be an\nexample of a lack of common-sense it does highlight that a\nlarge amount of the population believe there is a disconnect\nbetween online actions and of?ine effects, or at least do not\nhave the same understanding of risk in cyberspace that they\nwould have in physical space \(where perhaps they would\nhave limited dissemination of their imminent travel plans to\na small group of friends as opposed to broadcasting in the\nlocal bar – the social networking equivalent users of a particular OSN \(online\nsocial network evidence they are away from home, then using\nlogistics planning applications to optimize the route for thefts.\nIn a city population it is clear that a number of individuals\nwould be at risk of suffering this sort of attack.\nAnother example of the physical-world consequences of the\noversharing of information in cyberspace is the cancellation\nof an Israel Defense Force raid in 2010 after one of it’s\nsoldiers posted the date and location of a raid on Facebook\n[7], the raid was only cancelled because other members of\nthe same company saw the post and reported to commanders.\nOutside of a Big Data context this individual sharing could be\nconsidered an isolated incident where the exposure could be\nconsidered to be relatively constrained. However, within a Big\nData framework the automatic mining of all posts from those\nwithin a countries armed forces is certainly not inconceivable,\nand more powerfully the ability to mine the content of those\nfriends and family \(who will be less OPSEC aware cyberspace has increased the amount of\n‘publicly-available’ data and as we continue to share in-\nformation the risks associated with the aggregation of this\ndata becomes very real. The ability to infer a social-security\nnumber \(a piece of information most people view as ‘private been demonstrated [8]. The\npower of ‘Big Data’ further empowers this aggregation and,\ncombined with the risks associated with oversharing \(discussed\nin Section II-A to infer a social-security number from a picture of\nan individual \(albeit with some caveats  of\nenrichment is likely to produce vast commercial opportunity in\nthe form of more tailored services and advertising. However, it\nwill also provide increased opportunity for social engineering\nbased attacks and privacy losses. Such risks will not only\nbe felt by individuals, as evidenced by the data harvesting\nattack on a NATO Commander where attackers created a\nfake Facebook pro?le for NATO Supreme Allied Commander\nEurope Admiral James Stavridis to use to befriend colleagues,\nfriends and family and so garner information on him for use\nin a wider attack [10]. This is an example of a simple attack\nwhere research has already demonstrated the feasibility of an\nindustrial-scale version [11] putatively permitting a Big Data\nversion of the automated attack at a societal-level.\nC. Risks Associated with Location-Based Information\nLarge parts of the general 


public view cyberspace and the\nnatural-world as two very different spaces which are discrete\nand the ‘bleed from one space to another can be controlled\nand managed. In fact this is increasingly not the case and\nthe bleed between the two spaces can offer opportunity for\nintelligence gained in one to be used in attacks on the\nother; a would-be attacker of a company might use location-\ninformation on a key employee to plan a physical interaction\n614\ndesign to obtain information or develop a relationship key to\nsecuring access to their workplace. Equally, the publishing of\nlocation-based information can enable very speci?c attacks on\na person and their assets. Note that both of the examples in\nII-A have location-based information associated with them.\nWith respects to Big Data analytics we might expect a vastly\nincreased opportunity for malicious entities to predict location\nto greater accuracy, potentially increasing the threat faced.\nUnfortunately, our location in the natural-world is typically\nsomething that we hold very personal \(or at least its publicity\nas something we can control perceived\nprivacy whilst in the face of Big Data this is evidently no\nlonger the case; a challenge for effective risk control.\nD. Privacy Preserving Data-Mining\nThere has been much research surrounding the use of so-\ncalled Privacy Preserving Data-Mining \(PPDM  privacy at\ndata-release time. Data-modi?cation anonymisation such as\nk-anonymous [14, 15] and perturbation-based PPDM attempt\nto provide a degree of privacy when data is released by\neliminating or unifying uncommon entries across the data set.\nA common criticism of this approach is that it requires a\ngood understanding of previous and future data releases, in\naddition to other data sources that are available, in order to be\neffectively implemented. \(Incidentally the approach presented\nin this paper can be used to understand the release within the\ncontext of publicly available data-sets, but we do not expand\non this here Other PPDM approaches look to create synthetic\ndata which attempts to demonstrate the same fundamental\ncharacteristics as the original datasets; this can be either by\ncondensation where the data is clustered and synthetic data\nis created from the statistics of the clustered data [16] or\nby a randomized response approach [17]. Synthesizing data\nwhilst maintaining the characteristics of the original data-set\nis very challenging, arguably one of the key applications of\nBig Data is exploring information in which exists very weak\nsignals which, if not performed exceptionally well, synthetic\napproaches may not be able to regenerate.\nThese approaches are generally good at controlling the\nprivacy risks at a bi-party transactional level as data is shared\nor released. However, they are not designed to solely address\nrisk at a persona or system level – but they could be a\ntool utilised towards such ends. Our analytics are aimed at\nexploring such higher level concerns.\nIII. COMPLEXITY, FRAGILITY AND RESILIENCE OF\nDIGITAL PERSONAE\nCyberspace is an arena in which identity, or personae, are\nexpressed in many varied and occasionally contradictory ways.\nIn some spaces individuals may feel they are able to form\nhyper-emotive relationships with people through the perceived\nanonymity of the space [18] sharing more information than\nthey would in a similar real-world settings. Whilst in other\nspaces individuals may feel they should behave more as they\nfeel they ‘ought’ to 19]. It is exactly this complexity and the\ninteraction with the identity that an individual projects in the\nphysical space that is the driving question in the SuperIdentity\nproject which the underlying model used in this work supports.\nThe Superidentity project is an inter-disciplinary project\nfunded by both the Engineering and Physical Sciences Re-\nsearch Council \(EPSRC Homeland Security bringing together experts from\ndiverse ?elds such as traditional forensics, biometrics social\nand cognitive psychology and ‘cyber’ experts in order to work\non this complex area [20, 21]. We have created a model for\nunderstanding identity in a holistic manner [22–24], holistic\nidentities look to encapsulate all facets of identity displayed in\nthe 21st century. These holistic identities consider projections\nin the real-world through biometrics \(e.g. ?ngerprints, hand\ngeometry, femur length biographical / factual \(e.g. names,\naddresses e.g. usernames on forums, email addresses, IP addresses e.g. models of psychological identity such as big-\n5 25] or the dark-triad [26 identity from\na current set, modeling an identity enrichment activity \(i.e.\ntaking a set of known elements of an individual’s identity and\ninferring new elements of identity propagation of con?-\ndence as new elements are created, an understanding of the res-\nolution of con?ict within a superidentity and the time-sensitive\nnature of some elements of identity. Each inference has a\nnumber of dimensions associated with it \(attributes associated\nto the link the\ninference. For example, an inference may have a dimension\ndescribing the time it takes for an inference to be performed,\nother requirements could include access to the Internet, or\nthe requirement to interact with the target. We can create a\ngraph of capability from the available inferences, where the\nentire capability graph 


is constrained by the restrictions on a\nparticular exercise as some inferences are disabled potentially\nbecause of regulatory and legal issues socio-economic contexts. The\nmodel itself is beyond the scope of the paper but the reader\nis directed to previous work for details [22–24].\nFrom the model and the resulting graph of identity we can\nobserve that it is possible to enrich our understanding of any\nparticular persona, potentially with very limited amounts of\nseed data. This, in a sense, makes the privacy of our personae\nparticularly fragile in the face of Big Data analytics. As we\ncontinue to explore identity in a number of different contexts\nwe can start to explore interesting interfaces such as the\ninterface between individuals work and personal personae in\ncyberspace. If an individual is unable to maintain a separation\nbetween these personae then their employers vulnerability-\nsurface signi?cantly expands to include this individuals per-\nsonal cyber-persona Interestingly with the rise of Bring Your\nOwn Devices \(BYOD include the employees family and friends. If we assume that\nwithin a Big Data context an individual is unable to maintain\n615\nthis separation [22] then an organizations vulnerability pro?le\nincreases – possibly exponentially. Not only does it increase\nsigni?cantly, it is unclear how an organization can manage\nthe risk in a manner which employees will ?nd acceptable.\nAre there particular inferences which when enabled are the\nroot of signi?cant risk to personal data, individuals and the\norganizations with which they are associated?\nIV. GRAPHICAL IDENTITY\nAs we discussed in Section III above, we can create\na directed-graph with elements of identity as vertices and\ninferences as links. If we use a hierarchical set of labels\nfor the nodes within the graph we can model identity and\nanalyse which inferences we should be concerned about,\ndepending upon our concerns. For example at a high-level\nwe might consider protecting a ‘cyber’ identity, at the mid-\nlevel protecting biographical information about family, and at\na low-level protecting information about a Facebook account\nand at the fundamental data-level protection of a date-of-birth.\nIn order to provide an example of the modeling of identity\nand inference capability, an example model has been created\ncapturing inferences1 from academic research and those en-\nabled by widely-available tool-support. An example of a set\nof capability is shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, as can be seen, the\nhierarchy allows powerful questions to be asked of the data.\nThe colors of the nodes represent the different ‘domains’ and\nare consistent through the three ?gures.\nThese graphs are a very simple way of exploring the ques-\ntions around the complexity and fragility of identity. We can\nmodel which elements of identity we believe to be important\nto protect and which elements of identity we are happy to\nbe available, or indeed those that are already released or it is\nimpossible to withhold. We can then consider the capability\nthat could be used to bridge the set of elements we are trying\nto withhold and those we are happy to disclose.\nTo take a tangible example, consider all the information\nabout a partner / spouse to be represented by the node marked\nas spouse in Figure 2. We can observe all the links to\nthis node, this allows us to understand how we can attempt\nto control disclosures which might allow the inference of\ninformation pertaining to this facet of my identity. Further up\nthe hierarchy we can consider the spouse node is within the\nfamily node so we can examine how to protect disclosure\naround the family as a whole, down the hierarchy we can\nconsider protecting discrete parts of my spouse’s identity such\nas name, age or employer.\nWe can perform relatively simple graph-analytic calcula-\ntions, such as computing the number of inferences leading\nto or from a node \(it’s degree number of onward\nconnections enabled by a node, etc. These simple measures can\nhelp highlight nodes or inferences that are disproportionately\n‘powerful’ in an identity. Using these simple analytics we\ncan see that in Figure 2 that the trait attribute \(associated\nwith personality traits connected,\n1I.e. The capability of inferring one element from another.\nindicating that the ability to infer personality traits allows the\ninference of many more elements of identity and behavior,\nthis is further emphasized by the psychological nodes forming\nthe central core of Figure 3, a layout where highly connected\nelements are drawn to the center.\nMore complex analytics can be used to explore these\ngraphs in more interesting ways. For example, group-detection\nalgorithms can be used to identify nodes which form well-\nconnected groups of nodes. An informative analysis is to\nmodel the overlap between the hierarchical domain labels used\nby the nodes \(i.e. nodes which have some inherent similarity i.e nodes which are well connected bridges’.\nBy viewing the bridges between domains at different levels\nof the hierarchy we can highlight possible capability which\nmay be viewed as ‘intrusive’ – as it is the bridging between\ndifferent domains which offers the great value in Big Data\nanalytics, where connections within a domain may well have\nbeen easy to guess or predict before such computing power\nwas available. Bridges between top-level domains are probably\nthe area where the public are likely to be most concerned\nwith inferences, in general the public will view 


inferences\nfrom one top-domain to another as intrusive, these can be\nseen in Figure 1a. The general public have an expectation\nof anonymity around cyberspace \(e.g. [27–29 expected in the natural-world\n\(as Rose[5] described as risks associated with locations the hierarchy of elements, we can explore\nhow dif?cult it may be to keep the personae on different cyber-\ndomain services discrete; some people and organisations may\nview the links between recreational spaces e.g. Facebook e.g. LinkedIn as in Figure 2. Interestingly,\nas more Government and local authority services move to cy-\nberspace then the links between these services and recreational\nspaces are likely to be considered very intrusive, for example,\nthe ability to associate Facebook accounts with unemployment\nbene?t applications.\nWithin the biometric domain the ability to infer elements\nused for identi?cation \(such as ?ngerprints or iris scans from\neasily observable features is likely to be viewed as intrusive,\nthese data-level elements can be explored using the directed\ngraph at the base level of the hierarchy shown in Figure 3.\nFinally, we can use the graph to understand the sub-set\nof inferences and volume of connected elements which are\nrequired to establish a reliable pattern-of-life [30–32], and\nthe options for disrupting such knowledge. The volume of\nconnected elements likely to be of concern to individuals\nwithin society will vary from person to person. However we\nhypothesize that the ‘line-in-the-sand’ is likely to be the point\nat which reliable pattern-of-life is established, and that it is at\nthe point that individuals’ become fully aware and conscious\nof what this means that the demand for controls will arise.\nWithin a Big Data context, the ability to create analytics\nwhich are able to exploit weak signals within projections of\n616\n\(a High-level\nELRPHWULF\nLQGLYLGXDO\nSHUVRQDOLW\\\nGHYLFH\nZRUN\nIDPLO\\\nSHUVRQD\nSOD\\\nWHFKQRORJ\\\nZHEVLWH\nFRJQLWLYHIXQ\n\(b  enables many more potential arcs, for example the\nability to infer a Social Security Number from a public data\n[8]. For a capability to require a Big Data solution it is likely\nto be complex to understand and to some degree intangible,\nand as society struggles to understand these inferences this can\ndrive a level of mistrust and potentially increase the societal\nconcerns with particular capability in some hands Similiary,\ngovernments, civil bodies and commercial organisations may\nfeel that such rich identity enrichments could become the\nsource of risk to the systems they are charged with governing\n– as identity management underpins the security, safety and\nprovisioning of resources across most information infrastruc-\ntures, which in turn underpin most critical systems to societies.\nV. POLICY OPTIONS FOR ‘BREAKING THE ARC’\nIf the graphical model can help to elucidate the inferences\nwhich could be the cause of risk related to identity and\npersonal data, then could it also provide a source for control\noptions?\nA. Education and societal pressure\nA key step in affecting a societal-response to these societal-\nissues is education. If a society as a whole can understand the\ntrade-offs and risks associated with these Big Data techniques\nthey are then able to decide at a societal level whether these\ntrade-offs are acceptable. In essence it can allow responsible\ndata-sharing and also catalyse better policy making due to\na well-informed voting public. At present it is dif?cult to\nargue that society as a whole has a good enough understanding\nto make these risk decisions, or even give informed consent\nwhen sharing personal data. However, it is unclear what it is\nwe should be seeking to educate people about – we cannot\neducate people not to use cyberspace. Potentially we should be\nseeking to educate people to become consumers who demand\nprotection, but that will be ineffective without providing the\neveryday tools with which they can exercise protection. One of\nthe hardest parts of education around privacy is contextualising\nthe effects of disclosure. As we discussed in Section II-A,\noften the general public ?nd it dif?cult to map causes in\ncyberspace with effects in the natural-world. The model de-\nscribed in Section IV allows a user to explore the effects of\ndisclosure and the privacy implications of new capability. But\nin isloation it can only help people to understand the real\nmeaning of privacy in the context of Big Data and personal\ndata sharing.\nSince an educated population is better placed to be able to\nchoose between services, or even boycott those with policies\nand practices perceived as unacceptable, creating societal-level\nconsumer pressure could be a real option. There have been\noccasional notable instances where a society has reacted to\n617\nDPD]RQSHUVRQD\nIDFWXDO\nKREELHV\nKRPHDGGUHVV\nEDGJX\\IRUXPSHUVRQD\nEXLOG\nFKLOG\nHPSOR\\PHQW\nHWKQLFLW\\\nIDFH\nIDFH ERRNSHUVRQD\nIOLFNUSHUVRQD\nIRXUVTXDUHSHUVRQD\nJDLW\nJRRJOHSOXVSHUVRQDLQVWDJUDPSHUVRQD\nOLQNHGLQSHUVRQD RSLQLRQ\nSUHVHQFH\nVNLQ\nVSRXVH\nVWDWH\nWUDLW\nWZLWWHUSHUVR D\nYLPHRSHUVRQD\nYRLFH\nFFWY\nQDPH\nFSH\nFY\nGRFXPHQWV\nHGXFDWLRQ\nSHUVRQDOZHEVLWH\nIOXLG\nHPSOR\\HUZHEVLWH\nJHQHULF\nWRXFKV FUHHQ\nWZLWSLFSHUVRQD\nIRRW\nKRPHFRPSXWHU\nPRELOHSKRQH\nVKDUHGFRPSXWHU\nWDEOHW\nKDQG\nKDQGZULWLQJ\nNH\\ERDUGXVH\nXQLYHUVL W\\ZHEVLWH\nFig. 2. A simple open-source capability model using a low-level of the hierarchical labels.\nwhat they believe is an unacceptable change, the most recent\ncase in note was when in late 2012 the photo-sharing 


site In-\nstagram changed their terms and conditions and suffered a very\nvocal backlash from technically-aware users which caused it\nto revert to its original terms and conditions [35]. This threat\nof societal repercussions, notably a loss of Instagram’s main\ncommodity \(its user base the\nsociety \(or a very vocal group a slight drop in\nInstagram’s user base, and the effect was simply to change a\nsingle organizations policy. But this is not a risk control option\nthat could scale to a Big Data ecosystem; it is impractical to\nrely on militant consumers to effect a risk control across the\nentire industry.\nB. Voluntary governance\nConsumer pressure from an educated society may lead to a\nstate of voluntary governance, in which norms and baselines\nof acceptable practices are de?ned by the industry themselves,\npossibly with some form of independent oversight Voluntary\ngovernance has worked in some industries but also failed to\nprotect the general public in some high-pro?le examples, for\nexample the UK Press Complaints Commission. In addition to\nthe problems associated with voluntary regulation, the ability\nto de?ne the baselines of acceptable behavior is likely to be\nvery challenging. Arguably voluntary governance might be the\nquickest route to effecting change across the entire industry,\nbut to really offer any kind of risk control it would need to\ntranscend national boundaries. It is likely that resistance will\nbe offered from the large data gatherers and processors, as\n618\nFig. 3. A simple open-source capability model using a data-level of the hierarchical labels.\nany kind of governance over and above existing data protection\nlegislation is likely to be perceived as creating friction for their\nbusiness processes and potentially impacting the bottom-line.\nWith voluntary governance it is important to understand\nthe effect new capability \(i.e. the ability to perform new\ninferences ecosystem. This is\nparticularly important if new capability either bridges domains\nor joins well-connected sub-graphs as this can enable a large\nnew set of elements to be realised based on currently available\ndata The model gives a way of metricizing the effect of\nnew inferences, both in terms of the direct effect of the\nnew inferences and the effects which are enabled from the\ntransitive nature of transforms. This could be used to underpin\ncompliance monitoring approaches - where the monitoring is\nfocused on the data handling and processing practices around\nbridges. In this way the model could be used to redirect or\nrefocus our understanding of critical data assets in relation to\nprivacy impact \(those requiring particular attention towards\nthe creation of the bridge, and the subsequent protection of\nthe bridge \(and possibly the informing of the individual that\nsuch a bridge has been made in order that they may be enabled\nto contribute to the management of identiy and privacy risks\nsurrounding such knowledge voluntary governance is not suitable then regulation\ncan be considered, through, for example, the enforcement of\ndynamic consent \(e.g. [36,37 management of personal\ndata, enabling the right to ‘change your mind’ and revoke\ndata access privileges. This would require full transparency\nof the identity-related information retained about you and\nwith whom that data is shared or made available. How\nthis can be implemented within the distributed architectures\nthat are key to Big Data environments is unclear and also\nrequires more complex legal changes around data ownership.\nThe use of dynamic consent empowers the individual with\ncontrol of their own data, but again this relies on an educated\n619\nand aware society and only serves to break individual arcs\nwhen an individual feels it’s necessary. The use of run-time\ncompliance monitoring mechanisms may ease the process for\nthe Big Data organizations, as they could enable the business\nto manage risk associated with non-compliance in real-time.\nShould such monitoring be in use organizations may ?nd that\ntheir customer base becomes more willing to share data and\npermit processing of data, since they believe they are better\nprotected and can change their minds.\nWith regulation it is important for an organisation to be\ntransparent surrounding both their capability in infering new\nelements of identity and the con?dence with which these can\nbe attained. The model provides a framework within which\nthis capability can be eloquently described, it would also\nbe possible to aggregate the directed graphs from multiple\norganisations to indicate the total privacy implications This\nis one of the key issues in k-anonymity PPDM techniques\n[13] where the encapsulation of ‘external tables can be\nchallenging.\nVI. REFLECTION\n‘Big Data’ as a concept has, through the identi?cation\nof weak-signals within large amounts of multi-dimensional\ndata, the potential to enable genuinely revolutionary advances\nin medical-sciences, physics, etc. However, such analytics\nalso potentially enable privacy intrusions \(whether directly\nmalicious or not attacks’ potentially targeting\nat a societal-scale we should in turn be concerned at a societal\nlevel. Whilst any solution for managing risks will clearly need\nto involve individuals and enterprises there is signi?cant op-\nportunity for societal involvement. We have discussed several\noptions for the societal management of big personal data risks.\nConcepts such as dynamic consent may empower individuals\nto control isolated elements of 


identity or inferences yet the\nrequirements on the individual can become signi?cant. One\nof the key solutions may turn out to be an educated society\ncreating consumer forces driving enterprises and organizations\nto balance the use of Big Data analytics with consumer\nprivacy. However, creating a Big Data technology sector that\nis sympathetic to privacy concerns, and who might embrace\nmore sophisticated controls than currently available, is likely\nto be the optimum position. Since in this case, risk control is\nnative in the ecosystem losses more likely to be minimized,\nand con?dence built in the service provision. We believe that\nour graphical identity model could provide the analytics to\nunderpin the rationale for and the implementation of controls\nfor big personal-data related risks in cyberspace.\nUndoubtedly people that would attempt to attack or desta-\nbilize a society are likely to utilize cyberspace in some way.\nTherefore, it would be natural for authorities charged with\nprotecting society to seek Big Data analytics in order to iden-\ntify malicious threats and to intercept planning and logistics\ncommunications. The low-cost of computing hardware and the\nmassive storage capability, in conjunction with the analytics,\nmake the collection, storage and processing of general com-\nmunications an attractive option. The policy challenges are\nsigni?cant around managing the privacy concerns surrounding\nthe potential of such a Big Data system and the possible re-\nsulting loss in personal privacy of citizens. In the UK, through\nthe Right of Investigative Powers Act \(RIPA Ser-\nvices Act \(ISA WTA what individual\nagencies can and cannot do. Whilst the ?tness-for-purpose of\nsome of these laws, notably RIPA may be debatable it is\nimportant that there is a clear boundary demarking the extent\nof Government intrusion However this relies on public trust\nthat the checks and balances in place to ensure compliance are\nsatisfactory, this is dif?cult for the general public to engage\nwith and con?dence in elected Government Of?cials, Intelli-\ngence Agencies, Law-Enforcement and the wider civil service\nis often incorrectly intermingled and confused. Indeed, this\npublic trust is also required for the corporate use of big-data\nand ultimately corporate use will have a pro?t motivation not\nnecesarily present within the law-enforcement environment.\nOur future work includes an exploration of appropriateness\nof existing controls. We will be looking at how the graphical\nidentity model might elucidate how various organisations can\naccess personal data within a particular legal context and how the existing controls for personal privacy\nrelate to the graph.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to thank our partners in the SuperIdentity\nproject for their continued help and support and notably their\ninput into creating the taxonomy of the elements of identity.\nThe SuperIdentity project is funded by the EPSRC under\ngrant number EP/J004995/1 under the umbrella of the Global\nUncertainties initiative, and by the Department of Homeland\nSecurity in the US.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements. The opportunity for spectacular science return on this rare trajectory should not be missed The innovative SHOTPUT mission is truly one of a kind Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Anita Sohus, Amber Norton and JPL Team X for their contributions to this work.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
