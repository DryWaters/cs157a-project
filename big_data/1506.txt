 1 Analysis of Relay Network Duplexing, Multiplexing Multiple Access: Application to Aeronautical Networks Qian Zhang, David W. Matolak Ohio University Athens, OH  45701 740- 593-1241 qz490506@ohio.edu, matolak@ohio.edu  Abstract 227Relay networks have seen use in many systems including satellites, sensors, aeronautical systems, etc 1,2  Advantages of relays include range extension, capacity increase, reduced transmission power, and possibly diversity. Disadvantages include increased latency and implementation complexity. In aeronautical applications link distances can be orders of magnitude larger than in terrestrial cases, and propagation conditions are also substantially different. Thus, solutions for terrestrial settings are not necessarily applicab le to aeronautical cases Although relay networks have seen increased attention 
optimal resource allocation methods have not been determined. The question of which multiple access duplexing, and multiplexing \(M A/Dup/Mux preferable for relay networks is still under study. In this paper, we analyze several MA/Dup/Mux techniques in nonredundant uni-directional and bi directional relay networks These techniques allocate resources to network nodes in the time, frequency, and time-fre quency domains. We provide comparisons among the various schemes for uni- and bidirectional relay networks, in terms of resource allocation duty cycles, required data rate per transmission, required transmit power per link, and relative range. Although commonly employed techniques that only use time division appear adequate in some cases\227such as short range networks\227our results show that appropriate time-frequency schemes can be superior in terms of data rate and/or quality of service, especially for long range aeronautical networks Pure frequency division schemes also attain the largest

Historically, frequency division was the scheme of choice for duplexing and multiplexing [1 ased o n sim p licity an d  av ailab l e technology. Similarly, freque ncy division multiple access was also dominant, at least until the 1960\222s, for wired netw W i t h t h e advent of hi gh-rat e  si gnal  processi ng and economies of scale, othe r duplexing, multiplexing, and multiple access techniques have seen much research and deployment. This is particularly true of time division, an 
often \223natural fit\224 for digital signaling For terrestrial wireless comm unications, as infrastructure has grown more spatially dense, link distances have grown smaller, allowing time division duplexing to be practical Advantages of this mode of operation include channel reciprocity, and the ability to easily adjust relative data rates in the two link directions Time division multiple access TDMA\ used for cellular communication e.g., the Global System for Mobile Communication \(GSM  and TDM A i s bei ng pl anned as a com ponent 227al ong with frequency division multiple access \(FDMA imminent 4 th generation cellular systems that will use orthogonal frequency division multiple access \(OFDMA Code division multiple acce ss \(CDMA\requires spectral spreading beyond the bandwidth needed for data transmission, also saw commerc

The evaluation can be broadly classified as addressing \223r esource allocation techniques.\224 We build upon our work i  and by  doi ng so provi de 


 2 comparisons for multiple allocation schemes, in the context of aeronautical relay MANETs. The schemes we study include multiple access \(MA multiplexing, and duplexing techniques, and some of the physical \(PHY\work layer processing required to effect these medium access control \(MAC far as we have ascertained no such detailed comparative analysis has been done for relay networks, and work in m a y be t h e fi rst  t o  do so for mesh networks MANETs have seen a lot of r ecent attention, and are still a topic of much research. These networks have application in both military and commercial systems [5 e.g  in  ex ten d i n g  wireless local area network \(WLAN\capabilities, and in public safety applications. Yet quantitative comparisons of the various multiple access, duplexing, and multiplexing techniques \(MA/Dup/Mux\ have seen surprisingly little attention. Many commercial systems, and some military systems, have opted for pure time-division, or \223bursted\224 waveforms, without convincing theoretical or practical justificati we conduct e d a basi c com p ari s on of time \(T\frequency \(F\e-frequency \(TF\es for a particular network topology\227the full mesh. Our results showed that TF appro aches are clearly superior in performance to the pure time-division techniques for longrange or high data rate netw orks. Pure frequency division schemes can also outperform the pure time-division schemes, particularly when advanced signal processing for channelization and peak-to-average power ratio reduction are employed\227this can make the F schemes competitive with the best TF schemes. Note that our classification terminology here is still being refined. Classification by the three \223dimensions\224 of MA/Dup/Mux should clarify more precisely how the schemes are distinguished 3 For example the pure T scheme is T/T/T, and similarly the pure F scheme is F/F/F, whereas the \223TF\224 schemes will have two F and one T, or two T and one F designati ons. In this paper we employ the less precise TF designation for brevity. Note that we assume no random access in the network in our analysis\227 all available resources are assigned via orthogonal T, F, or TF domains, hence there is no \223contention.\224 The study in was rest ri ct ed t o a m e sh t opol ogy  but  som e  results will also hold in other topologies, such as in relay networks, centralized topologies \(sometimes called star or 223hub and spoke\224\brids of these topologies that exist in truly ad hoc networks. Extending our work to these other topologies is one area of future study In surveying the MANET literature, one finds a very large body of work, on a wide range of topics. For brevity, we  3 Our present definitions for thes e \223dimensions\224 are as follows: \(i MA  refers to how transmissions by different users are separated, \(ii Dup  describes how any given user sepa rates its transmissions from its receptions, and \(iii Mux refers to how any given user\222s transmissions to different receivers are separated. In each \223dimension,\224 separation is either by T or F \(until we extend to code se paration via spread spectrum in future work cite here only a few representative examples of the hundreds of papers published. These MANET topics of study include routing and capaci t y 7 connect i v i t y 8  cross-layer desi 10 and phy si cal l a y e r i ssues rel a t e d to these topics, e.g  Papers speci fi cal l y  addressing multiple access, duplexing, and multiplexing are rare, with two examples bei  14  for cent r al i zed short-range terrestrial comme rcial systems. The vast majority of work on MANETs for commercial systems pertains to terrestrial networks, but does include studies for both indoor and outdoor, mobile and non-mobile settings Nevertheless, important applications such as airborne and air-to-ground networks have not been nearly as widely studi M a ny references t o  ai rborne net w orks al so assume a vendor-specific technology 17 Two recent references on airborne networks for commercial applications are 19 i n whi c h t h e aut hors di scuss ad hoc networking techniques in the civil aeronautical environment \(in the VHF band\fic proposed standard for aeronautical networking \(L band\respectively Interestingly, the authors al so propose a TF approach The absence of quantitative comparisons of these techniques is surprising: very few researchers have addressed the appropriate choice of multiple access duplexing, and multiplexing sche mes, and the conditions in which one scheme may be preferable to another. Most studies either avoid the i ssue and address a specific technique, sometimes associated with a specific technology e.g., time-division duplexing \(T DD   or avoid the issue by addressing the problem in a highly idealized manner, e.g., [7 ich n eg l ects realities in  real networks, such as PHY layer statistical non-stationarity and network routing. Compared to many military and aeronautical systems, commercia l terrestrial systems often cover short ranges, and offer low to moderate data rates. It appears that TDMA and TDD are most common for these commercial systems [14 an d th is is tru e fo r so m e m ilitary aeronautical systems as well  The use of TDM A  and TDD as a \223default\224 approach, based primarily on results for commercial applications, or selection of TDMA/TDD while neglecting the advantages of the other approaches may be a serious mistake for some systems. \(Note that for any centralized systems the third \223dimension\224 of multiplexing is not required, since any given transmitter sends to only one\227not multiple\227receivers Even when direct comparisons among competing techniques are made, as in key i ssues we address initially, data rate and range\are essentially ignored  Re focuses on burst y net w ork t r affi c effect s t o  conclude that TDMA/TDD outperforms TDMA/FDD in terms of throughput, but the advantage cited in  i n  t e rm s of throughput is minimal, and again, completely ignores the range and/or data rate penalty of their proposed pure timedivision approach. The function of multiplexing in [20 is accomplished spatially, with directional antennas \(SDM 


 3 Similarly, the aut 22 descri be a sophi st i cat ed simulation tool for evaluation of MANET performance, but focus only on TDMA and CDMA approaches, and \(like many network simulators\reatly oversimplify the PHY layer. Recent efforts to quantify MANET performance theoretically 24 are focusi ng on devel opi ng information theoretic capacity bounds, and these efforts have not \(yet\plicitly addressed the choices of MA/Dup/Mux schemes and how that choice interacts with PHY and network layer processing In this paper we study pure relay networks, focusing on aeronautical applications. E ach platform is termed a network node, and for simplicity, we generally assume all nodes have equivalent capabilitie s. Section 2 describes the basic characteristics in the uni-directional network. Section 3 describes pure time division, pure frequency division and time-frequency division schemes in our relay network and in Section 4 and 5 we provide a comparison for these schemes in terms of important parameters. In Section 6 and 7, we extend to describe the MA/Dup/Mux schemes in the bi-directional relay network, and also provide an analogous comparison for the different schemes. Section 8 contains some additional comments on comparison. We provide a summary in Section 9 2  U NI D IRECTIONAL N ETWORK C HARACTERISTICS  In aeronautical networks, the most common node type is a fixed-wing aircraft These range from large transcontinental airliners to small leisure craft. Other node types include ground stations, and various types of satellites and High Altitude Platforms \(HAPs\8 A relay can ex ten d  coverage area and enhance capacity  and i s  oft e n required for beyond the horizon communication, as occurs in aeronautical networks For simplicity, this paper first considers a single-direction non-redundant relay network of n platforms \(nodes\ch includes one source \(S n-2 relays \(R\ination D\node. We assume all nodes are arbitrarily arranged in space. In practice, node density will vary, for example density will be high near large airports but small for trans e also assume that all messages are conveyed from S to D through all the equivalent relays R 1  R 2 205.R n-2  For a given duplexing, multiplexing, and multiple access scheme, relays are assumed to work in a store, process and forward m selectively according to the indicated time or/and frequency division method. In the simplest approach, relays demodulate and then subsequently re-modulate the data to relay, while in more advanced approaches, relays decode the data including error correction\t and then subsequently re-modulate to relay Here we assum e  that relays work in the latter mode and regenerate the received signal before transmitting to the next node with exactly the same available tr ansmission power. In this way the relay does not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio \(SNR each hop. Moreover, all nodes are assumed equivalent with the same bandwidth, receiver noise temperature, antennas modulation/demodulation scheme and signal processing complexity [4 r an alysis and comparison, we assume that the total available bandwidth is W Hz for all schemes and transmission rates are uniform across the network which means that the averag e one-way data rate is R b  bits/s W e assum e t h e schem e s operat e wi t hout  interference Any node has a total power available for transmission of P T  watts, during any time period, which is the power available at the transmitter\222s antenna i nput, and is the average power when transmitting without c onsidering duty cycle for bursted transm example, if the duty cycle is 1/2 because of time division, the long term average power will be P T 2 For a network that has n nodes, there is a total of L=n-1 one-way links. We assume that propagation path loss is proportional to range \(distance d to the power 002  3  D UPLEXING   M ULTIPLEXING MA  S CHEMES F OR U NI D IRECTIONAL N ETWORKS  In general, for the two basic duplexing schemes used in present mobile radio networks, frequency division duplex FDD\and time division duplex \(TDD and cons, but both can be flexible and can have scenarios where they can be used best 14 General l y TDD i s  preferred for use in short range networks, whereas FDD is more appropriate for use in wide areas. This is because TDD requires a duplex guard interval period that must allow for propagation delay as well as node transmit/receive switching Si nce som e researchers have been investigating the coexistence of TDD and FDD modes, such as in future cellular systems [26 it is lik ely th at TDD an d  FDD schemes may be integrated to obtain the best performance Time Division In our time division scheme, we use only the time domain to separate transmissions among users. We abbreviate this as the \223T\224 scheme. The simplest network consists of a source single relay, and destination n=3 smitted from S to R, and then to D, as indicated in Fig. 1 


 4  Figure 1 \226 The simplest uni-directional, non-redundant relay network The time axis is divided into 2 equal time slots of duration T slot The 2 consecutive slots can be viewed as a frame of length T f 2T slot The source transmits during the first slot waits during the second slot and then repeats this process the relay receives the data from the source during the first slot, transmits it to the destination during the second slot and then repeats; the destination waits during the first slot receives the data from relay dur ing the second slot, and then repeats. Therefore, in this n 3 T scheme, the source and relay transmission duty cycle is 1/2. In this case, no node needs to simultaneously transmit \(Tx\\(Rx\In addition, propagation delays only require that the slot duration be sufficiently long, but otherwise don\222t affect the time division scheme For this pure time division case, a single antenna and RF section can be used and it switches from Tx to Rx in time However, in some cases relays must transmit and receive signals simultaneously, for exam ple, if the source duty cycle is greater than one-half, or if the relay also has its own data to send. Under these circumstances, a large spatial isolation between transmitter and receiver is required. This can be aided by the use of directional antennas for the Tx and Rx at the relay, which in general point in different directions We next extend the network, and consider more than one relay. Our previous statements still hold, which means that we can still use only two time slots to separate all transmissions. The other relays just operate as the first relay does, receiving data from the pr evious node during the first slot and then sending the data to the next node during the second slot, and then repeating the process; see Figure 2 for illustration. Here for illustration we assume that the propagation delay is a very small fraction of slot time, so this is not shown in Figure 2  Figure 2 \226 Transmission diagram for time division scheme To obtain an average data rate of R b per one-way link, the per-slot data rate must be R b,T 2R b This requires a total bandwidth W  1 The received bit energy E b,r,T is then E b,T divided by i d 003 2R b We assume linear modulation total power available at any node during any time slot is P T  Therefore, the transmitted bit energy is   2 bT T bT T b E PR P R 002  the distance of the ith link. The equation is identical for all links Frequency Division In the frequency division scheme, only the frequency domain is used to separate transmissions. We abbreviate this as the \223F\224 scheme. Similar to the previous scheme, we first analyze the simplest network shown in Figure 1. There are 2 links for this simple network, so we need 2 frequency channels and the relay needs to simultaneously Rx and Tx for this pure frequency division scheme. The source only transmits continuously in one direction and the destination only receives continuously. Gene ralizing this network to more than one relay, we can conclude that there still needs to be only two frequency channels, which can be alternately used by the nodes. See an example in Figure 3 for a network of n=7 nodes. In this network, links SR 1 R 2 R 3 and R 4 R 5  use frequency channel f 1 and links R 1 R 2 R 3 R 4 and R 5 D use the other frequency channel f 2  S 1 R 2 R D 3 R 4 R 5 R f 1 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 2 f  Figure 3 \226 Transmission diagram for frequency division scheme  Source S Relay R d1 d2 


 frequency channels are needed to yield L=n-1 links x is the largest integer smaller than x Each frequency channel has bandwidth approximately 2 Wn and for average data rate R b  transmission during each slot must be R b,TF1 2R b The transmitted bit energy with available transmit power P T  during any slot is  11  2 bTF T bTF T b E PR P R  5 In this case, there might exis t \223co-site interference\224 if the two frequencies f 1 and f 2  are not separated enough in frequency. Hence, we may need to use spatial isolation to separate transmissions and receptions and/or we need 223guard bands\224 between the channels in practice to mitigate the effect of this interference. If this is not done, more than two frequency channels may be required Obviously, for this one-way link, no multi-carrier signal needs to be transmitted. However, the antenna for this scheme is more complicated as a result of simultaneous transmission and reception. We may choose to use one or two antennas. A directional antenna would provide better performance than an omni-dir ectional one, especially in line-of-sight \(LOS\tions Since we need two frequencies in the network, the bandwidth W must be divided into 2 channels, so W F  3 the same as for the T scheme Our second TF scheme reverses the arrangement of time and frequency allocations with 2 n time slots and 2 frequency channels. Figure 6 provides an example of the resource allocation for scheme TF 2 also for n=6 and n=7 nodes. Here each channel has bandwidth approximately W/2  and for average rate R b the per-slot data rate must be R b,TF2  2 n R b Hence, with P T available power during any slot, the transmit bit energy is then  22  2 bTF T bTF T b EPRPnR  4 1 SR Tx 23 R R Tx 4 R D Tx 12 R R Tx 34 R R Tx 12 R R Tx 1 SR Tx 34 R R Tx 23 R R Tx 5 R D Tx 45 R R Tx t f f t 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 f n=6 n=7  Figure 6 \226 Illustration of time and frequency allocations for n=6 and n=7 2D TF 2 scheme In the first two TF schemes, either the number of time slots or frequency channels is two, so if the number of links is large, the use of one domain is much more \223finely quantized\224 than the other. Thes e schemes can be referred to as 2-column schemes. To explore the effects of other allocations, the aim of TF 3 and TF 4 schemes is to avoid this  2 and the received bit ener gy is \(2 d 003 R b in which case the total bandwidth is still 2R b  and again R b is the data rate for each one-way link Similarly, with power P T available for transmitting by any node, the transmitted bit energy is    bF T bF T b E PR PR 003 W/2 002  Time-Frequency Division In this scheme, we use both time and frequency resources divided among users. For our one-way, non-redundant relay network, we consider 4 distinct TF schemes here. Assume there are n nodes in the network. Figure 4 provides an illustration of the resource allocation for TF scheme TF 1 for n=6 and n=7 nodes   1 SR Tx 23 R R Tx 4 R D Tx 12 R R Tx 34 R R Tx 12 R R Tx 1 SR Tx 34 R R Tx 23 R R Tx 5 R D Tx 45 R R Tx t f f t 3 f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f n=6 n=7  Figure 4 \226 Illustration of time and frequency allocations for n=6 and n=7 2D TF 1 scheme The example allocation shown in Figure 4 requires simultaneous Tx and Rx for some of the relays. The actual assignment of frequency channels to the nodes during each time slot can be arbitrary, so by re-arranging the allocated channels to assign the Tx and Rx for a given relay to different time slots, we can always avoid this simultaneous transmission/reception for all the relays; an example of this is illustrated in Figure 5   1 SR Tx 23 R R Tx 4 R D Tx 12 R R Tx 34 R R Tx 12 R R Tx 1 SR Tx 34 R R Tx 23 R R Tx 5 R D Tx 45 R R Tx t f f t 3 f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f n=6 n=7  Figure 5 \226 Another illustration of time and frequency allocations for n=6 and n=7 2D TF 1 scheme Therefore, 2 time slots and 2 3 n 


002  but if 2 002  the difference between the two schemes gets smaller Alternatively, if we set the distances to be equal, assuming a common received bit energy requirement, the relative data rate relationship for the two schemes is then    2 bF bT R R 212\212 R b With available power P T  during any slot, the transmitted bit energy is  33  1\/1 bTF T bTF T b EPRPn nR  6 223narrow rectangle\224 shape and tr y to distribute the \223cells\224 in the time and frequency domains more evenly With n nodes in the network, the number of links is L=n-1  The third TF scheme uses 1 n 212\212 5  The final TF 4 scheme is similar to TF 3 with the order of the allocations of time and freque ncy resources exchanged Now we use 1 n 212\212 time slots. For example, if n=9, L=8  and we use 3 frequencies and 3 time slots. Other examples are n=10, L=9 in which we can still use 3 frequencies and 3 time slots, but if n=11, L=10 we need to use 4 frequencies and 3 time slots to separate transmissions Hence, the resource allocation pattern for any n node network will be similar to a square, but there may be a few un-used cells Similar to the previous schemes, here we have R b,TF3  1 1 nn 212\212  frequency channels. Similar to the previous calculation, we can obtain the transmitted bit energy as  44  1 bTF T bTF T b EPRPnR 002  10 Hence d F d T The T scheme has a \2233 dB range\224 penalty versus the F scheme. For free space, and as a good approximation for LOS aeronautical networks 2 212 frequency channels and 1 1 nn 212 time slots, and 1 1 nn 002  7 where P T/link is the power per link in each scheme, and R bx is the transmitted data rate in each scheme. As an example, we address the T and F schemes    2 brT T bT T b EPRPRd 002  8     brF T bF T b EPRPRd 002  9 With equal P T equal average R b the same total bandwidth W and equal E b we obtain the relationship of the relative ranges for the two schemes as follows  1 2 F T d d  11  Therefore, under these conditions, the F scheme has a larger range or data rate than the T scheme. Table 1 provides a summary of the comparisons among the six schemes that we have described Thus, in terms of either range or R b the best scheme for this uni-directional network is the F scheme, followed by the T and TF 1 schemes. Neither of the latter two requires simultaneous transmission and reception for the relays When n increases, TF 2 requires a much larger data rate per slot, which means a smaller range for fixed P T Note that because of the duty cycle, the average power is different for each of the schemes. The last row of Table I lists the SNRs which can be calculated by SNR=P r N 0 B where P r is the per-link transmitted power divided by d 002  B is the occupied bandwidth per transmission, and N 0 is the thermal noise density. It turns out that for large n TF 1 has the best SNR but the penalty for this is latency: latency must increase as the number of frequency channels increases because the time slot duration must increase to maintain the desired data rate. We can designate this effect as an \223equal required area\224 in the TF plane for main taining data rate. The link range of the TF1 scheme is also still less than that of the F scheme. Also, the SNR of the F and TF 2 schemes is twice that of the T scheme. TF 3 and TF 4 yield almost the same SNRs According to the comparisons listed in Table 1, for this kind of relay network, either the T, F, or a TF scheme may be best in terms of some characteristic. However, if the relays need to send their own da ta while receiving and/or transmitting, the TF schemes may work more efficiently than the pure time division or pure frequency division schemes 212 6 4  C OMPARISON OF S CHEMES F OR U NI  D IRECTIONAL N ETWORKS  For all schemes, if we assume the same available power P T  and the same average rate R b and also assume that we require the same received bit energy, we can compare the relative ranges \(distances\e can support.

For larger networks with larger n we can find even more ways to design the rectangular schemes, which can provide more flexibility. In addition, for this example network with L 21 TF 1 is designed as 2 by 11, which provides 22 \224TF cells\224 and TF 3 is designed as 5 by 5, which provides 25 cells. For both these schemes, there exis t vacant cells that won\222t be used for transmissions, which makes the resource usage less efficient; nevertheless, for this example network, TF 5 has a 3 by 7 resource arrangement, which gives exactly 21 required links. So here, TF 5 is the most efficient scheme in terms of resource usage 5  A DDITIONAL C OMPARISONS FOR U NI  D IRECTIONAL R ELAY N ETWORKS   Assuming an additive white Gaussian noise \(AWGN channel, using the relationships in Table 1 for unidirectional networks, we can compare the one-way per link normalized channel capacity in bits/s   2 log 1 B CS N R J 212  and B TF4  1  1 n W n 4 6 8 12 16 18 20   C F C T C TF1 2 C TF2 C TF3 C TF4  Figure 7 \226 Per link normalized capacity comparison for a constant total transmission power and bandwidth n 8 Next, we want to compare the cost of the network for the different schemes, which is an important concern for deployment. We assume each node is identical and the cost per node is the same, and for brevity, we omit other networks costs here. Hence, to cover the same total distance d T from S to D, the scheme that uses the largest number of nodes costs the most. As we stated before n is the number of nodes, which gives n-1 links. So n-1 = d T d L for the T scheme, with d L the relative per link distance. We conclude that the scheme with the largest relative link range can employ the smallest number of nodes. The relative range is listed in Table 1. Here we compare cost for the F, T, and TF 1 schemes in Table 3 for 212 212 We also have J F 1 J T 2 J TF1 2 J TF2  2 n  J TF3  1 1 n n 212 212  J TF4  1 n 212 From the SNRs listed in Table 1, we can see that for large enough values of n such as n 8, we have the following relationship SNR TF1 SNR TF3 SNR TF4 SNR F SNR TF2 SNR T Figure 7 shows a plot of normalized capac ity \(i.e., spectral efficiency C/W vs. normalized distance. For this we assume P T N 0 W\=1 and as in an aeronautical case 002 2 and n 8 To more clearly separate the curves, the ordinate uses a logarithmic scale, but this does not affect the relative rankings of the schemes. The aim of the plot is to directly show the relative values of these schemes rather than the absolute values. We can see fro m the plot that scheme F has the best performance in terms of capacity, followed by schemes TF 1 and T. The TF 3 and TF 4 schemes for this network are the same, so the curves are identical                               002 2. We can see that to achieve the same total distance, the number of nodes required for the F scheme n F is half that of the T scheme n T and TF 1  scheme n TF1 which shows that the cost of the F scheme is lowest Table 3 Summary of Cost Comparison in UniDirectional Network Scheme F  T TF 1 Relative # of nodes required to achieve total distance d T d T 2 d T  2 d T   To illustrate the relationships of the important parameters in Table 1, we also plot other performance measures of interest.

For this initial analysis, we consider only a symmetric data rate in the bidirectional network.

Briefly, for a given number of nodes n since the number of links doubles, if we require L 223TF slots\224 in the uni-directional network, we will then require 2L slots in the bi-directional case Time Division Here again we use the time domain to separate transmissions/receptions among users and in different directions. Based on the analysis of the uni-directional case now we require 2 more time slots for the reverse direction and this results in a total of 4 time slots for the bi-directional case. Hence, two slots are used for the S to D direction, and the other two serve the D to S direction. The time axis is divided into 4 equal time slots of slot duration T slot The 4 consecutive slots are viewed as a frame of length T f 4T slot  Figure 11 gives an example that illustrates the time allocations for an n 7 node network  Figure 11 \226 Illustration of time allocations for n=7 pure time scheme 4 6 8 12 14 16 18 10 1                   P F P T P TF1 Rb F Rb T Rb TF1 Rb TF2 Rb TF3 Rb TF4  Figure 8 \226 Relative data rate comparison for a constant total transmission power and received energy n 8 Next we show the relative relationships among schemes for relative range and total transmission power P T For simplicity, we assume E b,r 10, and again use 2 4 6 8 14 20   


 13  Frequency Division For the pure frequency division case, we assume a symmetric frequency division link, which separates the spectral allocation into two e qual parts, with each half allocated to a direction of transmission between the source and destinati Usual l y t h ere i s a guard band t o  separate the transmit band and the receive band to avoid interference, which obviously reduces spectral efficiency  For si m p l i c i t y we i gnore t h e guard band for our analysis. Here, very similar to the uni-directional case, with four frequency channels, two are used for S-D direction and the other two are used for the reverse D-S direction. These are assigned alternately to the nodes, similar to that shown in Figure 3 With the bandwidth W divided into 4 channels, we have that W B-F  10 Analogous to the uni-directional case, the per-slot data rate must be R b,B-T 4R b to obtain an average data rate of R b per one-way link, which requires a total bandwidth W  14  Time-Frequency Division For this case, both time and frequency resources are utilized for signal separation in two directions. The principle of the TF 1 scheme is similar here to the FDD/TDMA scheme used in GSM \(a centralized system\divides the frequency domain into two bands used by downlink and uplink, and within each band, users are sepa rated by time slots. For the bi-directional relay network, the spectrum is divided to two frequency channels for S-D a nd D-S directions. In each direction, we use different time slots to separate transmissions among signals Note that for this case, there might be multi-carrier transmissions for the relay to transmit simultaneously to two consecutive nodes, such as relay R 2 for which the one node is R 1 and the other node is R 3 So with transmit power P T  available for each node, per link transmission power is  _1 2  BTF T PP  17 Next we consider four other distinct TF schemes. If there are n nodes in the network, the number of links in onedirection is n-1 and the total number of links for the bidirectional network is J=2\(n-1 Figure 12 provides an example illustration of resource allocations for the TF 3  scheme for n=5 nodes. It shows 2 time slots n-1=4  frequency channels, yielding a total J=2\(n-1\=8 orthogonal channels. Except for S and D, each frequency channel is dedicated to reception by a given relay  Figure 12 \226 Illustration of time and frequency allocations for n=5 2D Bi-TF 3 scheme Therefore, each frequency channel has bandwidth approximately W/\(n-1 and for average data rate R b  transmission during each slot is at rate R b,B-TF3 2R b The transmitted bit energy with available transmit power P T  during any slot is  33 _ _   2 bB TF T bB TF T b E PR P R 004 N where N is the number of carriers  For data rate R b the transmitted bit energy on any link is  _ 1 _ 1 2   2  4  bB TF T bB TF T b Tb E PR P R PR 003 W/4 003 R b 4 The total bandwidth is 4R b where R b is the data rate for each one-way link.

When a multicarrier signal is transmitted, this backoff is used to avoid non-linear distorti General l y  1 004 004   16 The TF 2 scheme is similar to a TDD/FDMA centralized system, which divides the time domain into 2 slots \(uplink and downlink\and in either slot, frequency resources can be used to separate users. Analogous to this, our TF 2  scheme uses two slots to divide the S-D and D-S directions and in each slot, the nodes alternately use one of the available two frequency channels. For this case, no multicarrier signal is transmitted. The transmitted bit energy on any link is  _ 2 _ 2   2 bB TF T bB TF T b E PR P R  18 Scheme TF 4 is illustrated in Figure 13.

As with the uni-directional case, in terms of SNR, the performance for the TF 3 and TF 4  schemes is better for large n but this comes at the expense of increased latency because of the need to increase time slot duration to maintain R b  As stated for the uni-directional relay network, the assignment of frequency channels and time slots to the 2\(n1 links is arbitrary. We do not necessarily need to separate the resources into a 2 by n-1 arrangement, instead, like the uni-directional case, we can shape the resource allocation for any n node network to be more like a square The design idea and equations will be similar to those for TF 3 TF 4 in the uni-directional network except that the number of links now is 2\(n-1 instead of n-1 Thus in the interest of brevity, we don\222t include these square schemes in Table 4, instead we briefly describe them here.

 15 increased, and this needs to be considered for the maximum number of nodes in the network. Generally, latency will be largest for the T scheme, so when the range gets larger and larger as it may in some aeronautical networks, this could constitute a problem. In terms of latency, in general, the F scheme is best and then the TF schemes The TF schemes require fewer frequency channels than the F scheme, and most TF schemes employ single carrier transmission. Thus although the F scheme has its own advantages, TF schemes may be good alternatives to the F scheme, especially for the long range aeronautical networks considering characteristics such as flexibility, resource efficiency, etc. Moreover, if n needs to be changed, TF schemes are more convenient because they can change the number of time slots, or if possible, can change the number of frequency channels, or even change both In practice, for both commercial and military applications additional issues arise, such as power constraints, spatial isolation with directional antennas, adjacent channel interference. Among other things, such as the use of spread spectrum, these are areas for future work 9  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we analyzed time, frequency, and multiple time-frequency schemes applie d to the non-redundant uni and bi- directional wireless relay networks, and conducted a straightforward comparison of several duplexing multiplexing/MA schemes in terms of resource allocation constraints, required data rate per transmission to obtain a desired average throughput, required transmit power per link, and relative range. Although commonly employed pure time division techniques appear adequate in some cases, such as short range networks, our results indicate that appropriately designed time-frequency schemes are preferable in terms of data ra te and/or SNR, especially for long range aeronautical networ ks. In addition, we can obtain the conclusion that pure frequency division schemes attain the largest range for a given data rate and performance. We also discussed the capacity and cost of the network, with results that use of frequency division or certain time-frequency divisi on schemes are superior For future work, we can ex tend the analysis of relay network from point-to-point links to point-to-multipoint link, such as in redundant relay network or ad-hoc network   We al so m a y consi d er usi ng spread spect rum t o  separate the user transmissions R EFERENCES   J.

movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
