process on the 003y according to the user's perception This integration not only improves the feature selection accuracy but also allows personalising such process The experiments performed show that the method improves up to 30 the query precision and decreases up to 11.6 times the number of features employed to compute the similarity in the contentbased query also decreasing the processing costs and memory requirements of the query execution Keywords Feature Selection Relevance Feedback User Perception Content-Based Image Retrieval I I NTRODUCTION Content-based image retrieval CBIR techniques and si 
milarity search ha v e been intensi v ely researched in the recent years CBIR techniques work on the whole information embodied into the stored images and are not limited by a textual description of it The advantage of working with the visual content of an image is to avoid the inherent bias and subjectivity of textual description Textual descriptions of images can be incomplete as the specialist can be interested in speci\002c aspects of the image under analysis letting some others unreported The medical area can greatly bene\002t from CBIR applications due to the huge amount of images daily generated by hospitals and medical centers CBIR employs image processing algorithms to extract relevant characteristics features from the images organizing 
them into feature vectors The feature vectors are employed in place of the images to compare them allowing fast and ef\002cient indexing and retrieval The features quantify intrinsic visual characteristics of the images such as color shape and texture usually leading to high-dimensional vectors The usage of a large number of features to represent images is a problem because the processes of indexing retrieving and comparing images become less accurate and more time consuming This occurs because the usage of a large quantity of features leads the CBIR systems to face the dimensionality curse problem This curse occurs because a usage of a large number of features and consequently a high-dimensional data leads each feature to 
diminish its signi\002cance Thus one of the major challenges in a CBIR system is to determine a minimal subset of features that best represent the images according to each specialist intention This paper aims at dealing with this issue Specialists have different perceptions of image similarity frequently feeling unful\002lled with the CBIR results In fact there is a disparity between low-level features and high-level user perception which is called the semantic gap  One way of gathering subjectivity in CBIR is to introduce the users e.g medical specialists into the process To avoid the semantic gap it is important to have the user interacting and telling what are the truly relevant images from those 
retrieved This way of interaction between the user and the system is called Relevance Feedback RF The RF approach asks the specialist to quantify the relevance of each medical image retrieved by a query allowing the system to automatically adjust future query results It is common that a medical image presents several clinical 002ndings with distinct visual patterns Thus it is important to note that each user should perform a speci\002c feature selection process according to his/her perception This mainly occurs because different specialists may be interested in different clinical 002ndings therefore employing distinct similarity criteria Hence it is crucial to capture information related to the user perceptual similarity during 
the search process in order to describe how each individual understands similarity in his/her speci\002c context to perform a feature selection guided by perception In this paper we propose a method that integrates RF and feature selection to improve the CBIR results In our approach the mining process is re-executed once after the RF iterations taking into account the information fed by the specialist reaching more precise and useful patterns The experiments performed show that our method improved the query precision up to 30 yet the dimensionality reduction allowed discarding up to 91 of the features Besides the method speeds up the whole CBIR system

since the complexity of the query processing decreases along the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector Moreover the proposed approach is effective in performing feature selection guided by each user perception The remainder of this paper is structured as follows Section II summarizes the concepts and related works Section III details the proposed method and Section IV discusses the experiments and the achieved results Finally Section V presents the conclusions of the work II B ACKGROUND AND T ECHNIQUES Comparing images employing exact matching is not useful in several areas e.g medical applications since searching for the same data already under analysis does not add extra information In fact the retrieval of complex data is mainly performed regarding similarity The most wellknown and useful types of similarity queries are the k nearest neighbor and range queries Similarity search is performed comparing the feature vectors using a distance  or dissimilarity  function to quantify how close or similar is each pair of vectors The distance functions most widely employed to perform similarity queries are those from the Minkowski family also know as the L p distances which are usually employed over vectorial spaces In this paper we employed the Euclidean distance L 2 and L 1  also called City Block or Manhattan  to perform the similarity queries A Relevance Feedback Relevance feedback ful\002lls an important role in CBIR systems due to its ability to gradually reduce the semantic gap through users interaction As a real-time learning strategy it can capture the essence of the user expectation leading to higher precision and improved query re\002nement Basically a relevance feedback technique is composed of three steps in the CBIR process Figure 1 illustrates a classic scenario of RF in conjunction with a CBIR system In Step 1 the system retrieves the most similar images according to the initial query In Step 2 the users guide the search process judging the returned images based on a relevance degree Step 3 the system captures the user expectation based on the performed feedback and automatically adjusts the further queries based on the user's informed relevance Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the user is satis\002ed with the results As the system captures the user's intention when a new query is performed the resulting set of images can be continually improved until be stagnated In this work we use the query point movement QPM technique to perform RF which consists of estimating the query point according to the user's interaction by moving it towards the positive examples i.e objects selected as relevant and away from the negative examples i.e objects Figure 1 RF in conjunction with CBIR selected as irrelevant Thus at each user interaction cycle an ideal query center is estimated in the query space The most well-known and widely used technique to iteratively improve the query center estimation through relevance feedback is the Rocchio's formula This formula is formally de\002ned in Equation 1 where Q is the original query i.e the initial feature vector Q 0 is the updated query i.e the resultant feature vector D 0 R and D 0 N are respectively the positive and negative examples given by the user N R 0 and N N 0 are the number of relevant i.e positive and irrelevant i.e negative examples in D 0 R and D 0 N  and 002nally 013  014 and 015 are weighting factors experimentally obtained to tune the relevance feedback factors In our approach we employ the Rocchio's technique together with incrementally feature selection to maximize the precision of content-based image retrieval Q 0  013Q  014 0  1 N R 0 X i 2 D 0 R D i 1 A 000 015 0  1 N N 0 X i 2 D 0 N D i 1 A 1 B Statistical Association Rule Mining In this work we employed the StARMiner algorithm which extended statistical rule mining techniques presented in to 002nd patterns in image datasets Let T be an image dataset x an image class T x 2 T the subset of images of class x and f 2 F a feature where F is the set of all original features employed to represent the images Let 026 f  Z  and 033 f  Z  be respectively the mean and standard deviation of the values of the feature f in the subset of images Z  StARMiner uses three thresholds de\002ned by the user 001 026 min  the minimum allowed difference between the average of the feature f in images from class x and the average of f in the remaining dataset 001 033 max  the maximum standard deviation of f values allowed in a given class and 015 min  the minimum con\002dence to reject the hypothesis H 0  The StARMiner algorithm mines rules of the form x  f  given the following conditions are satis\002ed 026 f  T x  000 026 f  T 000 T x  025 001 026 min 2 033 f  T x  024 001 033 max 3 H 0  026 f  T x   026 f  T 000 T x  4

Equation 4 states that H 0 should be rejected with a con\002dence equal to or greater than 015 min  in favor of the hypothesis that the difference between the means 026 f  T x  and 026 f  T 000 T x  are statistically signi\002cant A rule x  f returned by the algorithm relates a feature f with a class x  where values of f points to a statistically signi\002cant difference in the images of class x  This property indicates that feature f can distinguish images of class x  A set of rules x  f for the same predecessor x can be summarized in the rule x  R  where R is the union of the features returned by StARMiner for the predecessor x  meaning that the features in the set R are the ones that can best distinguish images of class x from the remaining images Hence the relevant features for class x are the features R  The union set S of all sets R returned by the StARMiner algorithm for all image classes contains the features that best discriminate the images into categories The set S is the resulting set of relevant features selected by the StARMiner algorithm In our approach we employ StARMiner to select the set of features that is considered in the similarity computation during the query execution At each relevance feedback iteration the mining algorithm is re-executed considering the feedback information fed by the user increasing its precision and improving the feature selection result The complexity of StARMiner is 002 ckN   where N is the number of instances of the dataset k is the number of features and c is the number of categories This algorithm was chosen because it produced better results when compared with other traditional feature selection algorithms such as the Relief and the Decision Tree Method DTM III F EATURE S ELECTION G UIDED BY P ERCEPTION We propose a method to improve the user satisfaction with the CBIR system that combines relevance feedback and feature selection The relevance feedback process iteratively enhances the training dataset applied to the feature selection process according to the user intention providing for each one a personalized training dataset closer to his/her perception The mining process is performed once as the dataset was tunned by the user expectations Consider G an image database composed of images from different classes  n classes  Every image f 2 F corresponds to a feature vector Therefore the distance between two images is de\002ned as d  q g  where q is a query center Given an initial k-NN query the retrieved images are the ones closest to the query center However these results may not reach the user's expectation due to the semantic gap problem Thus to include the users expectation in the process we employed the QPM relevance feedback technique where the user will label the relevant and irrelevant images from the retrieved ones  result an ordered list of the k most relevant images in G  Algorithm 1 describes the pipeline of the proposed method while the Algorithm 2 describes the process of incrementally building the training set according to the user's expectation Algorithm 1 Pipeline of the proposed method Require query center q  number of k nearest neighbors a

relevance feedback loop RF loop 3 relevance feedback mining data 4 association rule mining 5 feature selection which removes noisy features and bursts the most relevant ones When the user decides to 002nalize and visualize the answer similarity queries are executed with the selected features Initially the training dataset used in the process of association rule mining is empty At Step 1 the user performs an initial similarity query using a given image as query center In Step 2 the user labels the retrieved images as relevant or irrelevant Then in Step 3 the labeled images are used by Algorithm 2 to build a training dataset

Figure 2 Pipeline of the proposed method In Step 4 the association rule mining algorithm takes the built training dataset as input and then mine rules meeting the required support and con\002dence Finally in Step 5 the association rules generated are used in the feature selection process in order to select the most relevant features The feature selection is accomplished according to the user expectation since the training dataset is iteratively built during the relevance feedback performed in Step 2 Since the user remains in the feedback loop of Step 2 until he/she is satis\002ed with the retrieved results the training dataset applied to the process of association rules mining continues to be re\002ned until the relevance feedback process reaches a saturation point Thus each new feedback cycle can re\002ne the training dataset and consequently also the feature selection process In order to compose the training dataset from the relevance feedback iteration we adopted a particular strategy which was formally described by Algorithm 2 At each relevance cycle the user is asked to select a 002xed number of relevant images  N R 0  and a 002xed number of irrelevant images  N N 0  For example in the 002rst relevance cycle  Cycle 1  the user could be asked to select the 5 most relevant images i.e those within the same class of the query image N R 0  5  and 1 irrelevant image i.e in a class distinct from the query image N N 0 i  1  where i is the i-th image class from the dataset Since we construct a balanced training dataset when the user makes the choice and decides to feedback the system with them the irrelevant image is used to choose the other irrelevant images e.g 4 images of its same class i-th image class from the resultant set  result  of k images of the initial query to compose the training dataset too For instance considering an Image dataset G  if the selected irrelevant image belongs to the i-th class the other 4 images will be from this same class However there are some situations to consider Suppose there are insuf\002cient images from the same class e.g class A of the irrelevant ones in the resultant set  result  to complete the required number of images i.e N R 0 000 N N 0 i  and to build a balanced training dataset Then the remaining images that belong to the same class e.g class A of the irrelevant one are randomly selected from the image dataset Another situation occurs when the number of dataset classes  n classes  is greater than the number of irrelevant images selected from distinct classes  N N 0 Distinct  In this case the image classes that were not selected by the user will be randomly selected from the k resultant set  result  until reaching the required number i.e N R 0 000 N N 0 i  If it is not achieved the remaining images are randomly selected from the image dataset For example considering that only one image from the i-th class was selected as irrelevant the other irrelevant images from different classes are selected according to the described process It is important to emphasize that repeated images i.e those previously selected in past relevance cycles are never included in the training dataset in order to not build a biased training dataset This fact may occur when a user in different feedback cycles selects the same image of past cycles as relevant/irrelevant Our method includes the high-level knowledge provided by the user from the relevance feedback process into the training dataset used by the association rule mining algorithm thus helping to reduce the semantic gap and optimizing the feature selection process Moreover the method allows the system personalization since some specialists may have different expectations regarding an image domain thus building different training datasets Another point is that our method not only identi\002es the most relevant features according to the specialist expectation but also performs dimensionality reduction of image features avoiding the dimensionality curse problem The features are modi\002ed during each relevance feedback cycle by selecting the most signi\002cant ones and discarding the irrelevant ones To do so the training dataset employed to the mining of statistical association rules is incrementally increased according to the user expectation captured in each feedback cycle It is important to highlight that although in this paper we employ the StARMiner algorithm see Section II-B to

perform the association rules mining process without loss of generality other mining methods of association rules can be applied IV E XPERIMENTS This section presents experimental results when using our proposed method to execute similarity queries In order to evaluate our approach we employed precision 002 recall P 002 R graphs The precision of a query is the fraction of the retrieved elements which are relevant Hence precision  j R A j j A j  where j R A j is the number of relevant images retrieved and j A j is the size of the answer set The recall of a query is the fraction of the relevant elements which has been retrieved Thus recall  j R A j j R j  where j R A j is the number of relevant images retrieved and j R j is the number of relevant elements that should be retrieved When analyzing P 002 R graphs the closer the curve to the top the better the corresponding retrieval technique is To build the P 002 R graphs when the user decides to 002nalize and visualize the results we applied sets of k nearest neighbor  kN N  queries using all images of the analyzed image dataset as query centers varying the values of k  in order to compare our approach i.e features selected according the user perception with the original features In the Step 2 RF Loop of the proposed method was employed the Rocchio's technique setting the positive feedback constant as 014  1  0 and the negative feedback constant as 015  0  5  We chose to employ this well-known technique for showing our method applicability However other more sophisticated RF methods could also be used A Dataset Description We used a variety of image datasets acquired from our Hospital University to perform the experiments However due to space limitations we present here only the results obtained from one representative dataset The M RI dataset consists of 800 images obtained from magnetic resonance imaging exams The dataset was divided into 4 classes according to the body region image orientation and the height of the slice Figure 3 illustrates an example of each class a Axial Head MRI 200 images b Coronal Head MRI 200 images c Sagittal Head MRI 200 images d Sagittal Spine MRI 200 images Figure 3 Examples of images from the M RI dataset Each image from the dataset was processed using the Haralick's Texture the T raditional Gray-le v el histograms and the Zernike Moments These feature e xtractors generated feature vectors comprising 140 256 and 256 positions respectively They were used because they describe the gray-level distribution the texture patterns and shape peculiarities of the medical images B Results In our experiments considering the Steps 1 initial query and 2 RF Loop we applied sets of k nearest neighbor  kN N  queries more speci\002cally 80 nearest neighbor queries and the 002rst three relevance feedback cycles in order to build the training dataset For our experiments at the 002rst second and third relevance feedback cycles 5 10 and 15 relevant images were selected respectively For comparison purposes we always required the user to perform 3 relevance cycles Therefore the 002rst relevance feedback cycle always generated a training set with 5 002 n classes  were n classes is the number of classes in the dataset The second cycle generated a training set with 15 002 n classes  because it was increased by 10 new images and thus the third RF cycle always generated a training set with 30 002 n classes images as it was increased by 15 new images In all experiments a weight w  000 0  5 was assigned to the irrelevant images The P 002 R graphs of Figures 4 5 and 6 show the experiments performed over the M RI dataset represented by the Haralick features the gray-level histogram features and by the Zernike moments respectively using L 2 distance The graphs compare the original features i.e 140 features for Haralick and 256 for gray-level histogram and Zernike moments with the proposed method re\002ning the training dataset using the 002rst 3 relevance cycles gradually decreasing the number of features by selecting the relevant ones according to the user perception and at the same time obtaining a gain in the precision of the similarity queries Figure 4 shows the P 002 R graphs obtained using the Haralick features over the M RI image dataset Analyzing the graphs of Figure 4 we observe that the proposed method not only clearly improves the precision of the similarity queries but also achieved a considerable dimensionality reduction The precisions obtained by the relevant features selected using the training set generated in cycles 1 2 and 3 show that the curves practically ties presenting a precision gain of up to 30 over the precision of the original features i.e 140 features for a recall level of 40 It is important to note that the proposed method not only presents a considerable precision gain in all cases but also promoted a signi\002cant reduction of up to 6.7 times less dimensions in the third interaction which reduces the memory and processing cost These results show that the proposed technique improves the precision of similarity queries even when it reduces the dimensionality of the feature vectors

Figure 5 shows the P 002 R graphs obtained from the graylevel histogram features of the M RI dataset Analyzing Figure 5 we see that our method again presented a gain in precision of up to 14 for a recall level of 20 in comparison with the original features and those selected by the mining process using the third re\002ned training set In this case the feature vector size were approximately reduced to up to 11.6 times less dimensions in comparison with the dimension of the complete feature vectors Figure 4 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Haralick features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 5 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Gray-level Histogram features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 6 illustrates the results over the Zernike moments features We can notice that the proposed method achieved a precision gain of up to 11 in comparison with the original features considering a recall level of 60 It is important to highlight that the feature vector size again was reduced to up to 2.2 times less dimensions in comparison with original ones i.e 256 features Figure 6 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Zernike Moments features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 7 P 002 R graphs using L 1 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Haralick features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figures 7 8 and 9 show the P 002 R graphs obtained from the Haralick features gray-level histogram features and Zernike moments of the M RI dataset using L 1 distance Analyzing the graph of Figure 7 we observe that the proposed method not only clearly improves the precision of the similarity queries but also achieved a considerable dimensionality reduction The precisions obtained by the relevant features selected in cycles 1 2 and 3 show that the curves practically ties presenting a gain of 20 over the precision of the original features i.e 140 features for a recall level of 40 Analyzing Figure 8 one can see that our method again present a gain in precision of up to 9 for a recall level of 25 in comparison with the original features considering the third interaction Figure 9 illustrates the results over the Zernike moments features We can notice that in Figure 9 the method achieved a precision gain of up to 11 in comparison with the original features considering a recall level of 50

First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using product classes represents the hierarchical relationships among products. The method can make an effective dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as follows PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          \(1 Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically letC be composed as follows CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   \(2 11,0 ?= sk "  2?s WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the 


e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is defined as follows Let C _ be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C _ is defined by the following matrix for n product classes and m e-shoppers over the course of s periods  3 mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj   All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper The transaction clustering results in the following set of q clusters DDDD q"21 ,=                             \(4 Where each Di is a subset of C _ the given in \(3 A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by time  period is necessary for the identification of the dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following terminology Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as follows  5 Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can 


be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her past behavior, the input data should be divided into a conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The conditional part is composed of the left-hand-side assigned to the consequential part R j represents the association rule about the user specified minimum support and confidence in the following form R j 6 A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this 0 if Otherwise    C kTj 154 process requires new measures for calculating the degree of correspondence between the association rules and the behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is defined as follows     


1 1  s i i kTj i j SSD                            \(7 Where        1 if RD kTikTi   Si kTj 0 otherwise mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s ni "2,1 The above definition indicates that, if the behavior path of a target e-shopper i is equal to the conditional part of association rule j in the same period, then S j kTi ?,  is equal to one, otherwise is equal to zero. However, even if the similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that the support and confidence of the association rule may be remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness is defined as follows Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is defined as follows ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             \(8 Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of the association rule j with maximum FDij IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3 is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of e-shopper CID006 are C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk 


Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented as { }0,0,0,0,1,006 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006 _ C May and 0,0,1,0,0,006 _ C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can The dynamic purchase profile of CID016 buying the products may be represented as 0,0,0,0,1,016 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016 _ C May TABLE IV.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
