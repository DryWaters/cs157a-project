The association rule mining method is used to mine rules of infrequent itemsets and more interesting ones, and the outlier condition threshold is set upon the expert experience, searching for qualified data sets to distinguish the exceptional data among the monitoring ones of the City Operation System in this paper. The potential symptoms are acknowledged then through interactions of experts and machine providing a useful decision-making support for the monitoring and preventing accidents happening. The algorithm proved in this paper has been applied in Beijing City Operation Administration Software System successfully and testified by practice well Index Terms—outlier mining, association rules, City Operation System, accidents symptoms I I NTRODUCTION With the development of society and the need of modernization, the City Operational System has accumulated lots of useful data, and it has become a focal point in this field that how to find knowledge and make a strategic decision Compared with available mass monitoring data, the potential symptoms of accidents are “small samples” information models How to find these symptoms in the mass monitoring data of the City Operational System is crucial and important to prevent the accidents happening Data Mining is a progress in which the potential knowledge is found. Compared with numerous data, outlier data are those that are small but obviously deviated from the other data, not meet the general pattern or behavior of the data, and may be noise or the reflection of nature of the data. But outlier data may contain more valuable information than normal data, so they should be studied as important data also. Outlier data mining is an important study field of data mining, which is dedicated to find the objects that are significantly different from the other data in the data set [1  So  far th e o u t lier data mining has been widely studied and applied in many fields such as weather forecasts and the time series data analysis [2 This paper, combining the method of outlier data mining with associational rules, is about the mining and discovery of potential symptoms in unforeseen accidents of the City Operation System The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the concept of association rules will be introduced and the outliers in city operation system database are analyzed. In section 3, an outlier mining algorithm based on association rules are described and relevant experiments are given to prove its validity. Finally the conclusions are given in section 4 II B RIEF R EVIEW OF A SSOCIATION R ULES Mining association rules is an important branch of data mining, which describes potential relations among data items in databases, such as attribute and variant. Since R. Agrawal put forward Apriori algorithm, Association rule mining becomes one of the most popular research in data mini Mi n i ng  association rules can be stated as follows Suppose 12     m I ii i   be a set of items, let D the task-relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that TI  The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, a transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A T  An association rule is an implication of the form A B  where A I   B I  and AB  The rule A B  holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A B  This is taken to be the probability  PA B  The rule A B  has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B This is taken to be the conditional probability  PB A That is  Support A B P A B s      Confidence A B P B A Support A B Support A c    Mining association rules is to mine strong association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence one.

    The function of mining association rules is analyzing the relation between data items, and the rules of infrequent itemsets and more interesting ones. In order to finish the goal of outlier data mining, the itemsets less than the given threshold should be searched upon this III O UTLIER M INING AND C ITY O PERATION S YSTEM A Outlier Mining Outliers are the data that obviously deviate from others disobey the general mode or behavior of data and disaccord with other existing data. The concrete definition is as follows Supposing 12     n Xxx x    12     n Yyy y   are n demensional vectors, where X D   YD  and D is a sample set. Y is called an outlier when it satisfiers the following condition   EY EX 012  where 012 is outlier factor, and  E is the eigen operator of the entire sample set [5   Outliers may originate from measuring errors, computer inputting errors or man-caused errors, etc. These are usually called noise data. Outliers may also reflect the true properties of data, such as the rare disastrous weather recorded in meteorological database, which often contains one or more properties whose values seriously deviate from the normal values. However, these data may contain more valuable information than normal data. The so-called outlier mining means extracting outliers from the database. The discovery of outliers may result in some true but unexpected knowledge therefore such data should be retained Outlier data may be noise or interesting data of association rules. Therefore, the important monitoring data should be confirmed through interaction of experts and machine, then a synthetically analysis is given combining with other forecast methods to acknowledge whether the monitoring data is the potential symptoms of the City Operational System B The Outliers in Data of City Operation System There are mass monitoring data in the City Operation System, which are collected from different departments and fields of the city, such as traffic, weather, all kinds of water electricity, windpipe line, and etc. The relations between these data are complicated, the change of some data may have direct or indirect influence on the other data. Among the mass and complicated data, the data which have great influence on the normal running of he City Operation System should be given due attention. However, the change of some data are not obvious, but the data still have some impact to the city system's normal running, that are the outlier data of the City Operation System. The traditional data forecast methods can describe and analyze the change trend of all kinds of data easily, but it can't give a quantitative express of the degree of the relation between the data. Therefore, the outlier mining of the City Operation System is obviously important IV D ESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM A Description of Algorithm As mentioned above, the results of the association rules mining, the relationships between different data can be obtained by solving the problem of the frequency itemsets and then giving appropriate thresholds of the support and confidence. The purpose of outlier mining is to search the data itemsets which meet some threshold condition. If the definitions of association rules miming were improved and some outlier conditional items were defined, the outlier data namely which are different obviously from other data, could be mining and analyzed The outlier mining algorithm based on association rules is described in Fig. 1 as following Input  dataset max support threshold max_  Output: Outlier datasets  Begin     is the condition itemsets of kth layer of rules tree    compute  1 for 1  Ds O set C k C k O set C kCkn k 015 015   Begin scan and count support each  if support  max_ and support  0 then     if satisfies pruning criteria then discard   Dc i cs c OO c set set c  else  Children  End output  End CC c kk O set Figure 1 description of algorithm The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and the validity is proved in two ways in [6   The a l gori th m  i s  a p p lied  in the City Operation System, after some pretreatments on the monitoring data, and the application case is given in following section B Application and Analysis The monitoring data of the City Operation System include traffic, weather, energy, water, and etc. Water data used to analyze in this paper are listed in Table  TABLE I DATA FORMAT OF WATER Water Monitoring Data Water Water Supply Water Drainage 20080607 217 270 20080608 222 265 20080609 221 255   1422 ThP9.25

The data should be selected beforehand and be jointed according the date. At last, the results are given in form of rules, and more clearer and understandable interpretations are given with visual graphic display If a rule about the relationship between the item “coal_Sell and “coal_Stock” is mined, it can be described in form of coal_Sell->coal_Stock\(with support 0.2 and confidence 0.3 Its visual meaning can be described in a reference frame which horizontal axis represents support and vertical one represents confidence, showed as Fig. 2 Figure 2 description of the visual meaning of a rule More clearer and understandable interpretations about the rules can be given according the experts of City System. The outlier itemset is all the items which satisfied the criterion of outlier condition threshold In practical running, this algorithm is carried out on mass history data. Its precisions are validated according to the analytical result of experts. Some precision comparison results are listed in Table  TABLE IV PRECISION COMPARISON RESULTS Precision Comparison Number of Data Algorithm Expert 500 77.64 75.22 1000 78.31 72.86 1500 79.84 68.37 It can be seen from the Table that the precisions of algorithm are higher than those of expert subjective prediction The comparison experiments also show that the precision of algorithm will be higher when the number of data is increasing while the speed of mining will descend V C ONCLUSIONS The outlier mining on monitoring data of the City Operation System is to find the potential symptoms data which may endanger the City System. The potential symptoms data always are difficult to find or forecast by traditional data process method, if they are identified as noise points and therefore their influence on the system might be ignored Therefore, the outlier data should be mined using data mining methods The outlier mining method based on association rules is applied to analyze the symptoms in the mass monitoring data of the City Operation System in this paper, and has been applied in the practical city management software system successfully A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors appreciate the support of this work by Applied Basic Research Projects with Advance Technology of Tianjin No. 08JCYBJC10700\d Creative engineering Foundation of BJAST: key laboratory of public safety R EFERENCES 1 R Sridhar, R R a j e ev, S Ky u s eok Efficient  algo r i t h m s f o r  m i n i ng outliers from large data sets”, Proceedings of the ACM SIG MOD Conference, 2000, pp.427-438 2 L C h ao, Z   Yang chang, C Long bi ng O.

different approach to associative classification in that it does not directly use the rules generated by ARM, but only uses the frequent itemsets and their respective counts to build a classifier using a FOIL-like technique called PRM. Even before the advent of associative classifiers, many nonassociative classifiers were proposed, prominent of which is C4.5, which is a widely known decision tree classifi  and Ri  The principle of maximum entropy has been widely used for a variety of natural language tasks [22  A C M E  1 6  use s  it for binary data classification with mined frequent itemsets as constraints, discusses the failure of maximum entropy model to accommodate closed constraints, and proposes solutions to this problem. In fact, closed itemsets were first defined by Zaki in Thabtah in prov i d es a v e ry det a i l e d su rv e y of cu rre n t  associative classification algorithms. The author has compared most of the well-known algorithms, like CBA CMAR, and CPAR among others, highlighting their pros and cons, and describing briefly how exactly they work. He lays more emphasis on pruning techniques, rule ranking, and predication methods used in various classifiers, and also provides valuable insights into the future directions which should be undertaken in associative classification In [6 ller m eier p r o v id es a d etailed o v erv i e w o f fu zz y  methods as applied to data-mining.

PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we describe the performance study model that has been used for testing FACISME using three mostwidely-used disparate UCI Machine Learning \(ML\ datasets namely iris, breast, and pima. These three datasets are disparate from each other on various facets \(like number of attributes, type of attributes \226 numerical or binary, size of dataset, and type of dataset \226 dense or sparse\his makes any experimental analysis performed simultaneously on all the three datasets reliable and veracious, and such that its covers a wide range of aspects on which testing of classification accuracy and performance can be done The performance of FACISME has been compared with that of other state-of-the art classifiers, and the results of the same are detailed in section 6.A. Specifically, the classifiers used for comparisons are  200  Classification based on Predictive Association Rules CPAR 200  Classification based on Multiple Rules \(CMAR\8  200  Classification based on Associations \(CBA  200  C4.5 [22  200  Ri  200  Fuzzy Round-Robin Ripper \(FR3  200  Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm FURIA  200  Structural Learning Algorithm in a Vague Environment \(SLAVE    For the experiments on FACISME, we downloaded the raw datasets from the UCI ML website. These datasets then underwent the fuzzy pre-processing, mentioned in section 3 before being used to generate fuzzy frequent itemsets. To generate the fuzzy frequent itemsets that are used by FACISME, we have used the fuzzy ARM algorithm described in T h e m i n i m u m su pport u s ed f o r t h e f u zz y ARM process in order to build the fuzzy classifier, for all the three datasets, was 0.2 All the experiments were performed on an AMD 2600 Sempron PC with 512 MB main memory. All the approaches have been implemented by their authors with the parameters that they have used for testing. For CPAR, the best five rules are used for prediction. In all the experiments of FACISME and other associative classification algorithms\uracy is measured using the 10-fold cross validation. We implemented FACISME using Java on Windows XP. The results of the remaining algorithms i  e  excepting FACISME\aken from  2 4 25   A. Experimental Results As mentioned above, three standard UCL-ML datasets have been used to illustrate the efficacy of FACISME in terms of accuracy and simplicity of use. Figures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the experimental results to test accuracy obtained for various classifiers on each of the three UCI-ML datasets Fig. 4 shows the accuracy obtained by each classifier on the iris dataset. FACISME performs the best in terms of accuracy as compared to the other datasets. From fig. 5 we get to know the accuracies for all the classifiers on the breast breast cancer\et. And, FACISME performs nearly as well as the most accurate classifier for this dataset. Finally fig. 6 depicts the results of the experimental analysis done on pima dataset. Even in this case, FACISME performs the best as compared to the other classifiers. Thus, the basic inference from this experimental analysis is that FACISME consistently performs very well on the basis of accuracy, and is even the best in two cases Each of the classifiers \(excepting FACISME\used in this experimental analysis are crisp in nature, and thus use sharp partitioning to convert numerical attributes to binary attributes. Normally 5-6 sharp partitions are used, but these can extend up to 10 or more depending on the nature of the 


numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
