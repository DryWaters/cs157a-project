Abstract 
The incremental clustering algorithm plays a vital role in big data processing. The massive data problems generally raise high computation demand on the hardware platform. GPU-based parallel computing is a promising method to satisfy this demand. However, the existing incremental clustering algorithms face an accuracy-parallelism dilemma when accelerated by GPU. The block-wise algorithms evolve the clusters in coarse granularity and sacrifice accuracy for parallelism; while the point-wise algorithms proceed in fine 
granularity and barter parallelism for accuracy. We propose a moderate-granularity algorithm. This algorithm constantly generates micro-clusters from the incoming data blocks, and then evolves the clusters in the granularity of a micro-cluster The proposed algorithm takes the following advantages: first it avoids predefining a cluster number searching range like block-wise algorithms; second, it alleviates the accuracy problem caused by coarse granularity; third, it adopts the parallel-friendly algorithm to generate micro-clusters and decreases the amount of serial operations, so that it is parallelism-scalable compared to point-wise algorithms Experiments on a CPU-GPU hybrid platform show that our algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy to its batch counterpart and is scalable in terms of parallelism

I I NTRODUCTION  Due to the rapid developments of the digital sensors, highperformance computing, large-capacity data storage and communications, enormous volumes of data are being produced everyday in modern society. The huge amounts of data demand automatic analysis methods to extract concerned information, so that man can efficiently understand and use the data. A promising solution to this problem is machine learning. Based on their input type or desired output, machine learning algorithms can be categorized as: supervised learning, semi-supervised learning 
unsupervised learning and so on. The first two categories require labeled data as the training input, and labeled data are usually provided by human experts of a certain discipline However, labeled data are not available in all application scenarios. Moreover, with regards to the massive data problem, it is somewhat difficult to decide how many training data is enough. In contrast, unsupervised learning does not need labeled data, and thus can be more widely applied. In addition, clustering is a common method for unsupervised learning  Many clustering algorithms have been developed to handle massive data, including the incremental clustering algorithm. Using incremental clustering algorithms, the learning machine can process input data step by step. In each 
step it has access to only part of the entire input data points so its knowledge of the so far processed data can be built only upon these data points and the former knowledge \(if any\. The incremental clustering algorithm takes the following advantages  
the incremental clustering algorithm can identify the clusters with a single pass over the input [1   If it does not have a large enough memory to simultaneously memorize the entire input data, the learning machine can use the incremental clustering algorithm to process the input data points part by part The incremental clustering algorithm is helpful to eliminate redundant

computation. For instance, it can potentially contribute to redundant computation elimination of data center [2   Massive data problems often raise high demand on the hardware platformês computing power. Parallel computing is a common solution to provide powerful computing capabilities. In recent years, the General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit \(GPGPU\ has emerged as a promising device for parallel computing. The superiorities of the GPU includes: much faster increasing computing power than CPU 3  af f o r d ab ility p r og ram m a b ility  an d  s o on

algorithm of GMM \(Expectation Maximum Algorithm of Gaussian Mixture Model\. But this algorithm faces accuracy problems, because it evolves the clusters of the so far processed data in coarse granularity \(demonstrated in Part A of Section II\. Our previous work showed that the accuracy of this algorithm \(measured by Davies-Bouldin index\ is significantly lower than its batch counterpart \(the EM algorithm of GMM\ [5 And i t s fi na l cl ust er num b e r di ffe r s  from that of the batch counterpart, by order of magnitude While the block-wise processing pattern sacrifices clustering accuracy for parallelism, the point-wise pattern barters parallelism for accuracy. In each step, the point-wise algorithm processes the input data points one by one, and strong data dependency exists between adjacent steps. This kind of algorithms implicitly identify the number of clusters the number is naturally obtained in the clusters evolutionary process. The point-wise algorithms evolve the clusters of the so far processed data in fine granularity Therefore, they generally obtain good clustering accuracy  11]. A s f a r as  w e  k n o w  th ere are m u ch  m o re poin twise incremental clustering algorithms than block-wise algorithms. But due to the strong data dependency, their parallelism is limited, in terms of benefiting from GPUês computing power with best efforts A parallelized implementation of BIRCH [6  Bal an ce  Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchy\ was designed based on a MPI-supported multi-processor platform 12   Ho w e v e r  BIRCH is in h e r e n tly p o in tw i se an d i t o n ly  shows processor-level parallelism; inside each processor, the data are still processed sequentially. Thus, BIRCH is not suitable for GPU-like processors. With the support of CUDA PBIL \(population based incremental learning\ was applied to image stereo matching [1   R abe ir o e t  al et  al ev alu ate d  a GPU-based implementation of RAN-LTM \(Resource Allocation Network with Long Time Memory\ [1  PB IL  and RAN-LTM both show good learning accuracy and speedup on the GPU. Nevertheless, PBIL is not an unsupervised learning method and RAN-LTM cannot adjust the cluster number to the evolving data. Our previous work proposed an approximate incremental clustering algorithm of GMM [5  It ac tu ally m a in tain s th e p a ral lelism an d  im p r o v e s  the clustering accuracy of the algorithm in [4  B u t p r o b l e m s  still remain to be resolved, and three of them are: First, it is only for GMM clustering. Second, identifying the cluster number need a predefined searching range, which is hard to obtain for massive evolving data Third, resolving the cluster number involves running the EM algorithm on the same data block for many times and brings redundant computation In this paper, we derive an algorithmic method for GPUpowered incremental clustering from the works of [15 an d  10  In o r de r to s e ek b a l a n ce b e tw een accu ra cy an d  parallelism, our algorithm evolves the cluster in the granularity of a micro-cluster. A is a small dense region in the feature space constituted by the input data points. A cluster can be constituted by several or even many micro-clusters. In each incremental clustering step, our algorithm does the following two tasks: First, parallelfriendly part: it generates micro-clusters from the newly incoming data block by running a GPU-accelerated meanshift algorithm. Second, sequential part: based on the basic idea of the point-wise processing pattern, the micro-clusters are clustered one by one. The proposed algorithm takes the following advantages: First, the final cluster number is naturally obtained in the clustersê evolutionary process Therefore the cluster number searching range is not required Second, the size of a micro-cluster can be much smaller than that of a cluster, which ensures finer granularity than the block-wise processing pattern. Third, the parallel part maintains the inherent parallelism of the batch clustering algorithm. Also, there is another advantage with the microcluster granularity. The sequential part handles microclusters other than data points. Generally, the amount of micro-clusters can be much smaller than that of data points This significantly reduces the amount of sequential operations to be done and dramatically decreases the time span during which the GPU is underutilized. Experiments show the efficiency of our method as follows 1\ The most desirable incremental clustering algorithm should eventually obtain the same clusters as if the entire input data were processed at once. Images are used as the input. We run our method to incrementally segment an image and run its batch counterpart to segment the same image at once, respectively. Results show that our algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy to its batch counterpart The accuracy metrics are peak signal to noise ratio \(PSNR and the final cluster number 2\ The sequential part is done on CPU. The parallelfriendly part is run on CPU and GPU, respectively. The parallel-friendly part gains dramatic speedup from the computing power of GPU. In addition, the sequential operation number of our algorithm is smaller than that of the point-wise algorithm, by orders of magnitude The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II analyzes the accuracy-parallelism dilemma; Section III proposes our moderate-granularity incremental clustering algorithm; Section IV presents the experiments; Section V concludes our work and points out the further work II P ROBLEM A NALYSIS AND S TATEMENT  Suppose the incremental clustering is currently in the th  2, 3, 4,É\ step represents the historic clusters, and represents the input data of the current step.

In the first step 1 is directly clustered by the batch clustering algorithm; and the result serves as The abovementioned processing flow is summarized in Algorithm 1    There are many parallel-friendly bath clustering algorithms. Moreover, the time complexity of the testmerging is generally much lower than that of batch clustering. Therefore, test-merging \(Algorithm1 line 5 to 7 can be sequentially done on the CPU, and the batch algorithm \(Algorithm1 line 3\ can be accelerated by GPU  1 In the single-CPU and multi-GPU scenario is the total number of GPUs is the batch algorithmês running time on the th data block with a single CPU is the batch algorithmês running time on the th data block with a single GPU; and is the total running time of the test-merging operations from the th step to the th step, with a single CPU. If data blocks are simultaneously clustered and each of them is processed on a single GPU, then the speedup is  1 1   1  2   1 1  max 2 Obviously, the block-wise processing pattern is scalable in terms of parallelism. However, it evolves the clusters with coarse granularity and thus induces accuracy problems. An example of the accuracy problems is illustrated in Fig. 1 In Fig.1, the red points and green points are supposed to be affiliated to two different clusters of the benchmark. The mean vectors of these two clusters are shown in red and green circles, respectively. \(Note that the colors are only used to distinguish different clusters, and do not necessarily represent the RGB values.\he dotted rectangles represent the data blocks, and the dashed arrows point out the direction of the growth in the block number. The red points are distributed in block  1\d while the green points are concentrated within block 1\en running the batch clustering on each data block \(Algorithm 1 line 3 the algorithm has no global view of the entire red points. As a result, the red points are divided into three parts: 1\ step red points in block are identified as an independent cluster. \(Its mean vector is shown with a black circle  2 In step 1\se red points in block 1\ery close to the green points, they may be combined into a single cluster. \(The mean vector of this cluster is shown with a white circle.\ step red points in block are identified as an independent cluster. \(Its mean vector is shown with a gray circle              Fig. 1 Problems with the block-wise processing pattern The statistical equivalence of clusters is typically done based on their statistical characteristics \(mean vector covariance matrix, and so on\g this in mind, the biased statistical characteristics can exert negative influence on the equivalence test. For examples 1\ the equivalence test of step 1\ the red cluster of block and the wrongly combined cluser of block 1 are identified as not equivalent, then the red points of block and block 1\ cannot be merged; otherwise, if the two clusters can be merged, then the green points will be affiliated to a wrong cluster 2\ In the equivalence test of step the red cluster of block and the red cluster of block can be identified as not equivalent due to the biased statistical characteristics then the red points of block and block cannot be merged As the algorithm proceeds, these kinds of inaccuracy inevitably accumulate  Under this kind of processing pattern  2, 3, 4 only contains a single data point   1, 2, 3 The algorithm defines a metric function    The value of this function is either 1 or 0, which indicates whether is affiliated to cluster or not Note that the number of a data point s affiliated cluster is at most one.

Before completely identifying how changes the algorithm cannot obtain And cannot be processed without a clearly identified Thus, strong data dependency exists between two adjacent incremental clustering steps. However, the point-wise processing pattern does not have problems illustrated by Fig.1. This is because: every time it needs to identify a data pointês affiliation, the point-wise pattern always refers to the latest historic clusters \(Algorithm 2 line 4 to 6\. On the opposite, before referring to the latest historic clusters \(Algorithm1 line 5 to 7\, the block-wise processing pattern first decides the currently accessible data points affiliations based on a local view \(Algorithm1 line 3 As is discussed in this Section, incremental clustering faces a parallelism-accuracy dilemma III T HE M ODERATE GRANULARITY A LGORITHM    In order to achieve the balance between parallelism and accuracy, we propose our algorithm to evolve the clusters in moderate granularity     Our basic idea is to combine the advantages of both the block-wise and point-wise processing pattern. Two key points of our algorithm are summarized as follows 1 Abundant data points constitute a feature space. A is a small dense region in the feature space. A cluster can be partitioned into a certain number of microclusters Thus, the probability of wrong combination is low, due to the small size of the micro-cluster. Even though some wrong combinations still exist, the number of wrongly combined data points is small \(the bold rectangle 2 Extend Algorithm 2 to handle micro-clusters In fact, any batch clustering algorithm can be adopted to generate micro-clusters, as long as it satisfies the following requirements: 1\he algorithm does not need the predesignated cluster number or the searching range of the cluster number; 2\The granularity of the output clusters is tunable; 3\he algorithm is parallel-friendly, especially GPU-friendly Obviously, the mean shift algorithm is a desirable choice Given a set of data points the underlying probability density is estimated by  3 where   is a constant   is the kernel profile, and

And a stationary point has a gradient that equals to zero    0 The mean shift algorithm uses a hill climbing method to move every data point to its nearest stationary point; and points that converge to the same stationary point form a distinct cluster.\(For image segmentation, similar clusters can be further concatenated\. The bandwidth has significant influence on the clustering result. Bigger bandwidth usually results in larger clusters, or vice versa. For image segmentation, the spatial bandwidth and the range bandwidth can be different    We propose a neural network algorithm to cluster microclusters based on the SOINN algorithm [1  I n SO I N N  t h e neural network consists of a certain number of nodes. During the networkês evolution, the node acts as an agglomerative core as well as a cluster. Every node has a certain number of affiliated data points. All nodes contained in the same connected subset are grouped into a distinct cluster, when the neural network is fully built. Our algorithm leverages the basic idea of SOINN, but it handles micro-clusters other than data points. Notations to be used in our algorithm

We use other than because the latter is always in the center of the node s affiliated data points. In the scenario of incremental clustering, the distance from to may be too large. As a result, even though micro-cluster is homologous to node i.e. it should be affiliated to node it is still wrongly identified as distinct This problem is similar to the ones illustrated by Fig.1 However is constantly shifting to the potential position where the next homologous micro-cluster may appear Algorithm3 line 16    Similarly, the distance between two nodes  is defined as 1 1    8 The agglomerative radius of the node is a vital parameter for identifying homologous micro-clusters.

As is discussed in Part B of Section II, the sequential operations constrain the parallelism. In the sequential part, the micro-clusters can only be processed one by one, which is similar to the point-wise processing pattern Algorithm 2\ our algorithm, only 0 1 sequential operations are needed. But for this moderate-granularity algorithm, the point-wise algorithm would have to do  sequential operations. Thus, higher and lower are more favorable All experiments are done on a platform equipped with an IntelÆ Core2 TM E7500 CPU, and a NVIDIA GTX 660 GPU The main memory size of CPU is 2GB. Linux of 2.6.18194.el5 kernel is used with gcc 4.1.2 and CUDA5.0  Three 256-color grayscale images from the Rawzor benchmark are used as the input: artificial.pgm \(3072 000h 2048\es_iso_200.pgm \(3008 000h 2000\ and fireworks.pgm \(3136 000h 2352\ These images are transferred into 6291456, 6016000, 7375872 data points, respectively Each data point is a three-dimension vector, whose components are X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, and the grayscale. Note that our way of formatting data points is different from the method in  Every image is divided into a certain number of tiles Take artificial.pgm as an example, it is divided in the following way: 1\e image is divides into five 3072 000h 400 tiles and a 3072 000h 48 tile; 2\e first five tiles are spliced into one 15360 000h 400 tile, keeping their original order; 3 the 15360 000h 400 tile is separated into 400 000h 400 tiles and a 160 000h 400 tile; 4\ except the thirty-eight 400 000h 400 tiles, there are 3072 000h 48+160 000h 400=211456 pixels; 5 keeping the original order of the pixels and obeying the row-major sequence, these 211456 pixels are split into  160000-pixel tile and 51456-pixel tile. Overall, this image is divided into forty tiles. The other images are divided into tiles in a similar way. A comparatively large tile size \(1.6 000h 10 4 adopted , because we want to alter the micro-clustersê granularity by tuning the bandwidth parameters of mean-shift. If the tile size is too small, the size of the micro-clusters will be small even if large bandwidths are used. Each tile serves as a data block With regards to the benchmark and parallel-friendly part of our algorithm, the uniform kernel is used. The bath meanshift algorithm is run on CPU, and its output is the benchmark of accuracy. The sequential part of our algorithm is run on CPU; the parallel-friendly part is run on CPU and GPU, respectively. For the GPU code, CUDA grid size is 5 and CUDA block size is 256. The GPU-accelerated meanshift algorithm is implemented in a similar mann

The vertical axis is  and both achieve the top when 4 4. As the granularity grows, their decline at least obviously or even significantly reaches top when 10 8. As the granularity rises to 12 10, its also decreases. The final cluster numbers are shown in Table I. With regards to the cluster number obtained by incremental clustering is 1.48 times as large as that of the benchmark, but its top is 1.17 dB higher than the benchmark. For its top is 5.36 dB lower than the benchmark, but its cluster number is 48.3% of the benchmarkês. Likewise can achieve the 2.9 dB lower top with the 21.5% smaller cluster number Segmentation results of the benchmark and our algorithm are shown in Fig.5 \(at the end of this paper\. From Fig.3, Table I and Fig.5, we can see that our algorithm achieves comparable accuracy to the benchmark                 Fig.3 PSNR  TABLE I  rises significantly. Even when the granularity is small, a considerable part of computation still can be done on GPU decreases at least obviously or even significantly, which means higher parallelism-scalability. Even when the granularity is small, the can be as low as the magnitude of 10 3 The operation of Algorithm3 line 13 actually involves a loop \(similar to Algorithm2 line 4 to 6\. Actually, it can be parallelized on GPU, but the GPUês computing capability is very likely to be underutilized. A lower means a shorter time span during which the GPU is underutilized Currently, the problem of how to select suitable bandwidth parameters still remains to be investigated. However, even if the bandwidths are manually set to small values \(for example 4 4\ the accuracy is still comparable to the benchmark Compared to the block-wise algorithm, our algorithm does not need a predefined searching range of the cluster number avoids redundant computing, and is more likely to achieve high accuracy. Compared to the point-wise algorithm, our algorithm is more parallelism-scalable due to much higher and much smaller  In all, our algorithm can benefit from both the block-wise patternês and the point-wise patternês advantages             Fig. 4 Parallel-friendly rate and shrinking rate TABLE II C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper we present our work towards a moderategranularity incremental clustering algorithm. Our main idea is seeking the balance between accuracy and parallelism  Our future work will focus on identifying the suitable granularity for a given incremental clustering task. Besides we will also investigate whether new metric of cluster-tomicro-cluster \(or cluster-to-cluster\ distance can improve the
