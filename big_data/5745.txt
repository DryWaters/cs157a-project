On Mining Association Rules with Semantic Constraints in XML Md Sumon Shahriar 1 and Jixue Liu 2 1 Tasmanian ICT Centre CSIRO Castray Esplanade Hobart 7001 Tasmania Australia 2 School of Computer and Information Science University of South Australia Australia mdsumon.shahriar@csiro.au jixue.liu@unisa.edu.au Abstract An improved association rule mining technique with semantic constraints is proposed in XML The semantic constraints are expressed through the use of close properties of items in an XML document that conforms to a schema de“nition The proposed association rule mining with semantic constraints can be used for mining both contents and structures in XML I I NTRODUCTION As XML is widely used in data representation e xchange and storage format over the world wide web 3 4 data mining and knowledge discovery activities in XML 6  8 are recei ving signi“cant attention One of the important data mining activities is association rule mining in XML  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 In XML same data can be represented in different structures Moreover XML data can be associated with schema languages e.g DTD Relax NG 19 XML Schema 20 The exibility of representing same data in different structures and in different schemas has made the task of data mining speci“cally XML association rule mining more complex Although there are many proposals in XML association rule mining techniques in literature to the best of our knowledge there is a little work in mining association rule with semantic constraints for XML document conforming to a schema de“nition By the semantic constraints  we mean to use the ordered property in XML document that conforms to a schema Using the ordered property we capture the correct items in a transaction for mining association rules We use the following example to indicate the research problem Consider the DTD in Fig.1 The DTD describes the publications from different research groups   
 ELEMENT research  group      ELEMENT group  name publication    f lagship location       ELEM EN T publication  title type keyword   publisher   author       ELEMENT name  PCDATA     ELEMENT flagship  PCDATA     ELEM EN T title  PCDATA     ELEMENT type  PCDATA     ELEMENT keyword  PCDATA     ELEMENT publisher  PCDATA     ELEMENT author  PCDATA   Fig 1 An XML DTD The XML document in Fig.2 conforms to the DTD in Fig.1 The tree representation of the XML document in Fig.2 is shown in Fig.3 In an XML tree to represent a node we use an identi“er v  a label e and the associated value txt for leaf nodes only For example T v 2 is represented as  v 2  name  T asM AN  and T 
v 1 is represented as  v 1  group  T v 2 T v 3 T v 4   research group name>TasMAN</name publication title>Sensor Data Mining</title type>Book</type keyword>Pattern</keyword keyword>Clustering</keyword publisher>Kluwer</publisher author>John Li</author author>Mark Dev</author title>Mining Provenance from Hydrological Process</title type>Journal</type keyword>Workflow</keyword keyword>Clustering</keyword publisher>IEEE</publisher author>John Li</author author>Riccu Von</author publication flagship>WFO</flagship group research Fig 2 An XML document 
Fig 3 An XML document in Fig.2 represented in XML tree Now consider the rule that if the author is Mark Dev then the research topic keyword of the author probably is 978-1-4577-1539-6/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 1 


Clustering To calculate the support and con“dence for the rule Mark Dev  Clustering  we need to consider the transactions that include author and keyword elements in the XML document If we observe the XML tree in Fig.3 we see that the elements keyword and author are repeated under the element publication In order to calculate transactions containing the elements keyword and author we rst consider the minimal hedges T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 10 T v 11 and T v 12 T v 13 T v 14 T v 15 T v 16 T v 17 T v 18 and then we consider the minimal transactions T v 7 T v 8 T v 10 T v 11 and T v 14 T v 15 T v 17 T v 18 using the ordering property in XML document Note that T v 10 T v 11 T v 14 T v 15 is not a minimal transaction because the the authors and keywords are from different hedges violating the ordered properties in XML document So the support for the rule Mark Dev  Clustering is 0.5 and the con“dence is 0.5 However the support for the rule John Li  Clustering is 1.0 and the con“dence is 1.0 We aim to contribute on the followings  We exploit both schema DTD and document in mining XML association rules  The proposed XML association rule mining considers semantic constraints expressed through the ordered property in XML documents  Both structure and content can be considered in mining association rule with semantic constraints The paper is organized as follows In Section II we give basic de“nitions and notation In Section III we de“ne the language and algorithm of proposed association rule mining with semantics for XML We further de“ne support and con“dence for the proposed XML association rule mining in Section III-C Finally we conclude with future work in Section IV II B ASIC D EFINITIONS AND N OTATION In this section we present basic de“nitions needed throughout the paper We de“ne the notation of DTD De“nition 2.1 DTD An XML DTD is de“ned as D   EN,G  where a EN is a set of element names b G is the set of type constructs and g  G is de“ned as one of the following i g  Str where Str means  PCDATA  ii g  e where e  EN  iii g   means EMPTY type iv g  g 1  g 1 or g 1  g 1 is called conjunctive or disjunctive sequence respectively where g 1  g is recursively de“ned g 1   Str  g 1     g  g c 2   g 2  e  e  EN or g 2  g    g  or g 2  g  g   called a component where c    1     is the multiplicity of g 2    i s the component constructor c   e  g  c is the function de“ning the type of an element e where e  EN and g  G  We term   e  as element de“nition  d  is the root of the DTD and that can only be used as       We now give an example to explain the notation of DTD Example 2.1 Consider the DTD in Fig.1 The DTD is de“ned as D   EN,G  where EN   research group name publication f lagship location title type keyword publisher author   G    group     name  publication    f lagship  location      title  type  keyword   publisher   author       research  group      group   name  publication    f lagship  location       publication  title  type  keyword   publisher   author      name  Str    f lagship  Str    location  Str    title  Str    type  Str    keyword  Str    publisher  Str    author  Str and   research  We now de“ne paths on the DTD De“nition 2.2 Path Given a D  EN G      a simple path  on D is a sequence e 1   e m  where  i  e i  EN  and  e w   e 2   e m   e w is an element in   e w  1  A simple path  is a complete path if e 1    A path  is empty if m 0  denoted by     When we say path we mean simple path We use function last    to return e m  beg    e 1 and par  e w  e w  1  the parent of e w Weuse len    to return m  Paths satisfying this de“nition are said to be valid on D   We give an example to explain paths on DTD Example 2.2 Consider the DTD in Fig.1 In Figure group/name is simple path research/group/name is a complete path because research is the root of the DTD last  group/name  is name and beg  group/name  is group  len  research/group/name  is 3 We de“ne the notation of an XML tree De“nition 2.3 XML Tree The XML tree T representing an XML document is de“ned to be one of the followings i T   empty ii A labeled node T  v  e  txt   iii If T 1   T f are trees then T  v  e  T 1 T 2  T f  is also a tree T 1  T f are called subtrees  The symbol v is the node identi“er which can be omitted when the context is clear Now we give an example to show an XML tree Example 2.3 Consider the document in Fig.2 The document is represented as T v r  v r  research  T v 1   Then T v 1  v 1  group  T v 2 T v 3 T v 4   T v 2  v 2  name  T asM AN   T v 3  v 3  publication  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v

Riccu V on   The XML tree is shown in Fig.3 We de“ne the hedge and the conformation of hedge De“nition 2.4 Hedge and Conformation Let  v  e  T 1  T n  be a tree where T 1  T n are subtrees of a node v with label e  A hedge H is a maximal sequence of consecutive subtrees from T 1  T n that conforms to a component g under the context node v  denoted by H  g or H g   When there are multiple hedges for g  we use H g j to denote one of them and H g  to denote all of them We now give an example on hedge Example 2.4 Consider the DTD in Fig.1 and the tree in Fig.3 Let the component be g 1   name  publication    f lagship  location   be a component Then H g 1 1  T v 2 T v 3 T v 4 is the hedge conforming to g 1  Let g 2  title  type  keyword   publisher   author    be the component Then H g 2 1  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 10 T v 11 T v 12 T v 13 T v 14 T v 15 T v 16 T v 17 T v 18 is the hedge conforming to g 2  Now consider the structure g 3   title  type  keyword   publisher   author    Then H g 3 1  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 10 T v 11 and H g 3 2  T v 12 T v 13 T v 14 T v 15 T v 16 T v 17 T v 18 are the hedges conforming to g 3  We de“ne the tree conformation using the hedge De“nition 2.5 Tree Conformation Given a DTD D   EN,G  and XML Tree T  T conforms to D denoted by T  D if T  H       We now give an example to illustrate the tree conformation Example 2.5 Consider the DTD in Fig.1 and the tree representation of the XML document in Fig.3 The root   research and the the element de“nition   research   group    The hedge H  group    T v 1 conforms to the component  group    We then get T r  researchH  group     Thus the tree in Fig.3 conforms to the DTD in Fig.1 We de“ne minimal structure of a DTD De“nition 2.6 Minimal Structure Given an element de“nition   e  and two elements e 1 and e 2 in   e  of a DTD the minimal structure g of e 1 and e 2 in   e  is the innermost component belonging to the component   e  that contains both e 1 and e 2   We present an example to show the minimal structure Example 2.6 Let group be an element and  name  publication    f lagship  location    be the element de“nition of group in the DTD in Fig.1 Now consider two elements f lagship and location  Then the minimal structure of the elements f lagship and location is  f lagship  location    But the minimal structure of publication and f lagship is  name  publication    f lagship  location    We now de“ne the minimal hedge De“nition 2.7 Minimal Hedge A hedge that conforms to a minimal structure g is a minimal hedge  We now de“ne pre“xed trees The reason for de“ning pre“xed trees is to get the trees for a path De“nition 2.8 Pre“xed Trees We use T e to denote a tree rooted at a node labeled by the element name e  Given path e 1   e m  we use  v 1  e 1      v m  1  e m  1  T e m to mean the tree T e m with its ancestor nodes in sequence called the pre“xed tree or the pre“xed format of T e m  Given path   e 1   e m  T  denotes  v 1  e 1      v m  1  e m  1  T e m and is called a tree of the path   When the context is clear we use T e m to mean T   Given path   e 1   e k   e m  prec  T    v 1  e 1      v k  e k      v m  e m  means the precision of the tree T  for path    T   is the set of all T    T     T  1   T  f    T   returns the number of T  in  T     Example 2.7 Consider an element title  Then T title means one of the trees T v 5 and T v 12 in Fig.3 Let   research/group/publication/title  The pre“xed trees of T title are  v r  research  T group v 1 T publication v 3 T title v 5 and  v r  research  T group v 1 T publication v 3 T title v 12  The precisions of the tree T  are prec  T    v r  research  T group v 1 T publication v 3   Then  T     T title    T v 5 T v 12  and  T title  2 We now de“ne the minimal transaction from minimal hedge De“nition 2.9 Minimal Transaction Consider a minimal structure g m  e 1    e i  e j    e n  for the elements e i and e j and a minimal hedge for g m is H g m  Then the minimal transaction  contains only the trees with the elements e i and e j   We present an example on minimal transaction Example 2.8 Let g 3   title  type  keyword   publisher   author   be a minimal structure for the elements author and keyword  Then H g 3 1  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 10 T v 11 and H g 3 2  T v 12 T v 13 T v 14 T v 15 T v 16 T v 17 T v 18 are the minimal hedges conforming to g 3  From the hedge H g 3 1  we get the minimal transaction  1  T v 7 T v 8 T v 10 T v 11  In similar way we get the minimal transaction  2  T v 14 T v 15 T v 17 T v 18 from the minimal hedge H g 3 2  III A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING IN XML A Language for association rule mining We now de“ne the language for association rule mining in XML De“nition 3.1 An XML association rule is de“ned as        where  is a complete path called context   is a set of simple paths called rule body   is a set of simple paths called rule head and    are complete paths  Example 3.1 Consider the XML association mining rule as  research/group publication/author  publication/keyword   In the rule research/group is a complete path and publication/author and publication/keyword are simple paths Also research/group/publication/author and research/group/publication/keyword are complete paths 3 


Example 3.2 Consider another XML association mining rule as  research/group/publication author  keyword   In this example we see that the context research/group/publication is different from the context research/group in the example 3.1 B Capturing semantics in ordered XML document To capture semantics for association rule mining in ordered XML document we use the concept of minimal transaction The minimal transaction extracted from the minimal hedge preserves the semantics using close properties of items in mining association rules The semantics through the close properties is considered for the ordered XML documents We now give an example to show the close properties in minimal transaction Example 3.3 Consider the association rule in the example 3.1 First we calculate the minimal structure for the elements author and keyword as g 3  title  type  keyword   publisher   author    This is because publication is a common path for the paths publication/author and publication/keyword  Now the minimal hedges are H g 3 1  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 10 T v 11 and H g 3 2  T v 12 T v 13 T v 14 T v 15 T v 16 T v 17 T v 18 conforming to g 3  Note that we do not consider H g 3 x  T v 5 T v 6 T v 7 T v 8 T v 9 T v 17 T v 18 a minimal hedge because the trees T v 17 T v 18 violate the order of document to form a minimal hedge From the hedge H g 3 1  we get the minimal transaction  1  T v 7 T v 8 T v 10 T v 11  In similar way we get the minimal transaction  2  T v 14 T v 15 T v 17 T v 18 from the minimal hedge H g 3 2  C Support and con“dence for XML association rule mining with semantic constraints We de“ne the support      of an association rule       s    012      where    is the total number of minimal transactions  means the percentage of transactions that contain both  and   The conf idence      of an association rule        is de“ned as                   Example 3.4 In this example we calculate support and con“dence for the association rule given the example 3.1 We have already calculate the minimal transactions  1  T v 7 T v 8 T v 10 T v 11 and  2  T v 14 T v 15 T v 17 T v 18 in the example3.3 For simplicity we denote the minimal transactions as  1  P attern   Clustring   JohnLi   MarkDev  and  2  Workflow   Clustering   JohnLi   RiccuV on  omitting the node identi“er v and the label e  In case of MarkDev  Clustering  we get support 0.5 and con“dence 0.5 For JohnLi  Clustering  the support is 1.0 and the con“dence is 1.0 D Algorithm for association rule mining We now present the algorithm for association rule mining in XML In algorithm 1 we take an XML document T that conforms to a DTD D  context   body   head  as inputs We also take optional minimum support M inSup and minimal con“dence M inConf as inputs Input  An XML DTD D  an XML document T conforms to D  context  body  head  M inSup M inConf  Output  XML association rules with Support  Conf idence  Calculate minimal structure and minimal hedges from context 1 body head and condition Extract minimal transactions from minimal hedges 2 Calculate support and con“dence using minimal transactions 3 Algorithm 1  Mining XML association rule with semantic constraints According to the algorithm 1 we rst create the minimal structure in the DTD according to the paths of body and head under the path of context The minimal structure is then used in creating minimal hedges in the document In the minimal hedges we extract the minimal transactions that only contain the values of the last elements of body and head Minimal transactions are further used in calculating support and con“dence of the association rules If minimum support M inSup and minimum con“dence M inConf are given as inputs the algorithm returns the rules above the minimum support and con“dence E Association rule mining with structure As the structure  e.g labels or tags is important for conveying the semantics of data mining structure of the XML document is also important The proposed association rule mining technique can be used both for mining contents and structures In case of association rule mining with structure we do not consider the values of the last elements of paths in the minimal transactions We rather consider the element names labels in the minimal transactions We give a motivating example on mining structures  Fig 4 Association rule mining with structure in XML Example 3.5 Consider an XML association mining rule as  research/group name  f lagship   This rule means that under the node group  if there is a node name  then probably there is a node f lagship  We show the sketch of mining XML structure in Fig.4 In this example the minimal transaction is  v 2  name   v 4  f lagship  from the XML document in Fig.3 Example 3.6 Consider another XML association mining rule as  research/group/publication title  type publisher   This rule means that under the node 4 


 Fig 5 Association rule mining with structure in XML publication  if there is a node title  then probably there are nodes type and publisher  We show the sketch of mining XML structure in Fig.5 In this example the minimal transactions are  v 5  title   v 6  type   v 9  publisher  and  v 12  title   v 13  type   v 16  publisher  from the XML document in Fig.3 IV C ONCLUSIONS We propose an improved theoretical framework on XML association mining rule with semantic constraints The semantic constraints is captured using minimal hedge and minimal transaction considering the ordered property of XML data The proposed association mining rule can not only be used in content mining but also be used in mining structure in XML In future we aim to investigate performance analysis of the proposed algorithms for XML association rule mining with semantic constraints for synthetic and real world data V A CKNOWLEDGEMENT The Tasmanian ICT Centre is jointly funded by the Australian Government through the Intelligent Island Program and CSIRO The Intelligent Island Program is administered by the Tasmanian Department of Economic Development Tourism and the Arts This research is supported as part of the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans National Research Flagship and Information and Communication Technologies ICT Centre Capability Development Project R EFERENCES  T i m Bray  Jean P aoli and C M Sperber g-McQueen Extensible Markup Language XML 1.0  World Wide Web Consortium W3C Feb 1998 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml   Suchanek F   V arde A.,Nayak R and Senellart P  The Hidden W eb XML and the Semantic Web Scienti“c Data Management Perspectives EDBT  pp 521-526 2011  M Arenas and L Libkin XML Data Exchange Consistenc y and Query Answering PODS  pp 13-24 2005  E Bertino and E Ferrari XML and Data Inte gration IEEE internet computing  pp 75-76 2001  Nayak R XML Data Mining Process and Applications  i n Song Min and Wu Yi-Fang Eds The Process and Applications of XML Data Mining Idea Group Inc./IGI Global 2008  Nayak R Disco v ering Kno wledge from XML Documents  i n W ang John Eds Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining Idea Group Reference IGI Global 2005  V arde A Suchanek F   Nayak R and Senellart P  Kno wledge Discovery over the Deep Web Semantic Web and XML DASFAA  LNCS 5463 pp 784-788 2009  Shetter  R Shobha G Surv e y on Mining in Semi-Structured Data  IJCSNS  vol 7 no.8 pp 226-231 2007  Rusu L.I Rahayu W   T aniar  D  Mining Association Rules from XML Documents In Vakali A Pallis G eds Web Data Management Practices  2007  Ling F   Dillon T   W eigand H Chang E  A n XML-Enabled Association Rule Framework DEXA  LNCS 2736 pp 88-97 2003  Majuran M Quintarelli E T anca L Mining tree-based frequent patterns from XML documents FQAS  LNAI 5822 pp 287-299 2009  Zhang S Zhang J Liu H W ang W  XAR-Miner Ef cient Association Rules Mining for XML Data WWW  pp 894-895 2005  Liu H.C Zeleznik o w  J Jamil H.M Logic-Based Association Rule Mining in XML Documents APWEB workshops  LNCS 3842 pp.97106 2006  Canea v a  E Oliboni B Quintarelli E Mining Fle xible Association Rules from XML EDBT/ICDT workshops DataX  pp 85-92 2009  P aik J Nam J Kim W  Y   Ryu J.S Kim U.M Mining Association Rules in Tree Structured XML Data ACM ICIS  pp 607-611 2009  Braga D Campi A Klemettinen M Lanzi P  Mining Association Rules from XML Data DAWAK  LNCS 2454 pp 21-30 2002  Zhang J Ling T  W   Bruckner  R.M Tjoa A.M Liu H On Ef cient and Effective Association Rule Mining from XML Data DEXA  LNCS 3180 pp 497-507 2004  W an J.W W  Dobbie G Mining Association Rules from XML Data using XQuery DMWI  CRPIT Vol 32 pp 169-174 2004 19 http://www.relaxng.org  Henry S Thompson Da vid Beech Murray Malone y  and Noah Mendelsohn XML Schema Part 1 Structures  W3C Working Draft April 2000 http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1  5 


For that, the service will check based on its properties, rules and preferences defined and the resources needed whether it can or should instantiate it. If the execution is properly done, it will continue executing the services of the same level of the tree. It a service cannot be executed or an error occurred, the execution will go down a level in the structure, in order to process the subordinated services \(Service 2.1, Service 2.2 etc subordinated, the next service level to be executed will be the corresponding to the directly upper level, that is, Service 3 III. NFC SCENARIOS CREATOR With the purpose of testing the functionality and utility of the interaction model described, a tool named NFC Scenarios Creator \(NFCSC developed in Java for the scenario definition under the model described and that integrates the use of them to be understood by a MIDlet that will be executed in a NFC device NFCSC allows, therefore, the definition of the scenario rules and user interaction preferences; it also has the capability both of recording the Tags associated to the objects in the scenario as of generating the contents needed for a proper performance of the MIDlet Although NFCSC is still in development stage, the system allows to establish the hierarchy of functionalities associated to each object and to define restrictions and preferences NFCSC \(Fig. 4 scenarios or projects. For each project a set of identifying attributes are defined, as well as the objects that compose the scenario, the services associated to the objects, the general and user interactions preferences and the resources used on it Each scenario is described by a XML document, as shown in the DTD file from Chart I  CHART I. DTD FOR THE SCENARIO DEFINITION xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8 ELEMENT XMLProject \(XMLDescription, XMLPath XMLResource*, XMLTag ATTLIST XMLProject ID CDATA #REQUIRED name CDATA #REQUIRED ELEMENT XMLTag \(XMLDescription, XMLResource XMLService

So when an object is detected the services to be offered can be defined and also the way to execute them. Herewith, together with the installation or deployment of an application, the initial XML file of the project is also stored in the device being the processing of that file by the MIDlet the one that really defines the interaction The user can modify the XML file making use of the MIDlet, adjusting the parameters that define the interaction model \(properties and resources a user that in the scenario definition decided that when touching a certain object an action started automatically, could modify that decision converting it to manual afterwards, or activate/deactivate the vibration when touching a Tag, simply by changing the values of the corresponding properties in the XML file As can be seen in Chart I, each project is defined by a 


unique name and identifier, a description, and a set of Tags assigned which characterize the scenario together with a set of resources. The Tag identifier includes the scenario identifier which allows the MIDlet of the device to reach the XML document that has to been used in order to guide the interaction For each Tag one or several services could be defined and one or several resources could be associated to them. The services could be defined in a recursively way, which allows specifying the execution hierarchy aforementioned. For each service a set of attributes is defined, those attributes define their activation and execution mode The resources used in the interaction should also be stored in the device, so, together with the definition and, pending of the type it is possible to: define its content \(XMLContent specify the path where it is stored in the device \(SMLPath Figure 4. NFC Scenario Creator main interface As can be seen in Fig. 4, the NFCSC interface is divided in some sections. The left sidebar presents the different projects scenarios of the projects represented as the root of the tree, while the Tags assigned to each scenario are added as if they were their leaves. The system allows to edit the information of the elements from each scenario, both the Tags and the own project Pending of which element is selected among the project tree, the content of the central panel would be different. For each project the system allows to introduce a general description, as well as to assign the general resources used If a Tag is chosen, the possibilities offered by the system change, allowing: a management, c associated to the services, and d among the execution hierarchy established NFCSC has an event viewer \(frame placed under the main pane the system during the interaction with the user. Each entry in the event viewer is composed by the time when that event happened and a description that allow the user to know the action that has been performed. Thanks to this log the edition or step back in the scenario building is easier IV. AN EASY EXAMPLE. EMERGENCIES AND ASSISTANCE 


SYSTEM With the aim of showing the characteristics of the proposed model and the tool built, its application to a very simple example will be described with the purpose of not including an extension and complexity not needed  Figure 5. Emergencies and assistance example The basic idea of this scenario is that any user in urgency could ask for help in an easy, quick and intuitive way, just by touching with their NFC device an image with a Tag associated. Chart II shows a fragment with the definition of the scenario described As shown in Fig. 5, the scenario is formed by a frame where, in order to represent the emergency, a picture of an ambulance has been placed. Behind the ambulance there is a Tag. Where the device is got close to the Tag placed in the frame: a the MIDlet retrieves and decode the content in order to identify the scenario, c XML file and its resources, d corresponding action and services and, e ends up the application The full definition of the XML file that specifies the interaction in this simple example contains two services: a phone call to the emergencies number, and b message to two relatives, both making use of multiple device 12 resources. However, and for keeping it short, Chart II only shows a partial view of the example, showing only the definition of the general properties of the Tag as well as the first two services and some examples of resource use As shown in Chart II, the Tag has defined the use of two resources. First one is associated to the vibration of the device while the second is about an information text that will be displayed to the user when starting the interaction CHART II.

In this case is a tel URI. This service makes use of an audio resource whose content it stored on the device storage. In future versions it will be implemented with a voice synthesizer Notice how the following service definition, corresponding to sending a sms, is indented from the previous one. This 


means that the service is in the same branch, but at a lower level in the hierarchy of services execution. Therefore, this service will only be conducted if an error has occurred in the execution of the previous one. As shown in chart II the latter service uses an image resource in charge of showing some information at the MIDlet display and whose content is also stored on the device Besides, the MIDlet allows in a simple way to modify all those parameters that define the execution of the services and their use. As commented before, a user could not want that a service is executed automatically and requires manual confirmation. For that, he/she only would need to change the value of the execution parameter of the service into manual. In the same way, the user can activate or deactivate the use of resources just by modifying the value of the state attribute into off. Even more, it is possible to add new resources, if, together with their definition some content needed for their execution is included Therefore, it can be checked as, even when the user define an initial interaction for a scenario and even when the same deployment is done in different devices, each user could easily adapt and customize the interaction to its needs and preferences afterwards Equally, the user could activate or deactivate a service changing the execution order and modifying the hierarchy initially defined for them. Herewith, the same scenario could be customized and act in a different way depending of the person that interacts with it V. DISCUSSION IoT is not a reality yet, but a prospective view of a series of technologies that, combined, could sharply modify the interaction mode with our environment and the working of our society in the following years. In order to establish the IoT philosophy, it would be needed an advance of the development and dissemination of elements as sensors, new communication technologies \(as well as their intercommunication mobile devices able to integrate them, a proper infrastructure and above all software applications that supports them and are able to integrate all those elements, as well as to fulfills the needs and requirements of the users Those new systems must also be adapted to the different interaction scenarios and, mainly, to the different 


characteristics, requirements, preferences and needs of the people that interact with the environment. In this paper we present a model that provides a solution to this issue The model is based in augment different objects among a scenario with Tags, by the assignment of services and resources defined in an abstracted hierarchy that allows configuring a customized interaction model. Thus, for the same scenario, the model is able to define different interaction contexts. So, a context is defined as the aggregation of: a certain scenario formed by a set of intelligent objects offering a set of services, b characteristics, preferences and needs, c and d Under the proposed model a tool that allows the definition and scenario deployment has been built. A neuter MIDlet installed in the NFC device is the one in charge of guiding the 13 interaction through the definition of the scenarios stored in a XML file. This architecture allows that the same MIDlet could be used with any scenario and that the user could adapt the interaction to his preferences Currently we are working in the completeness of the model and the complex interaction scenarios generalization, being the latter based in rules systems that allows adapting the different interaction contexts to the users ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain \(MICINN Project TIN2009-07184 REFERENCES 1] M.

dataset contains a stream of TCP connection records from two weeks of LAN traffic over MIT Lincoln Labs. It consists of 42 attributes that usually characterize network traffic behavior, both categorical attributes and quantitative attributes such as duration of the connections, protocol type etc. Attribute src_byte denoting the number of data bytes from source to destination and attribute dst_bytes inverse are selected in this experiment.  They are both quantitative attributes The user specified parameters are set as follows 5, 0.3, 0.03, 0.01,W min_sup preMinsup T 0.5, 0.4, 30.min_confidence max_MFB min_num_triples And the number of transactions in each time slot is 250 It is assumed that there are no more than three fuzzy sets or intervals in the datasets i.e. 3F Four different approaches to mine association rules are compared using the following notations: Fuzzy+MFB: the approach that use both fuzzy method and MFB_measure with 1 3.0? = and 2 0 .5 2 0.5? = , Fuzzy+P: the approach using fuzzy method with 1 3.0? = and 2 0.5? = also but repressing the first part of the MFB_measure that ignores the changed rate of the membership function, Discrete1: the approach using discrete method with 1 2 1.5? ?= =  and Discrete2 : the approach using discrete method with 1 2 2.5 TABLE I.

Comparison of Execution Time Fig. 3 shows the execution time of the four approaches The runtimes of them grow linearly as the data stream grows which confirms that they are scalable with respect to the size of data stream, and it is mainly because of the usage of sliding window model. Fuzzy+P uses the least time Fuzzy+MFB has similar execution time to Discrete2, and Discrete1 has the most execution time. The difference of runtimes between them is mainly influenced by the clustering operations they use. The more clustering operations were executed, the more runtime it was Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the number of frequent itemsets and interesting rules found with the data stream increased Fuzzy+P and Fuzzy+MFB used less clustering operations than Discrete1 and Discrete2. Fuzzy+MFB nearly finds the most number of frequent fuzzy sets and interesting rules with the second least of clustering operations. Sometimes Discrete2 returns nearly the same number of fuzzy sets and interesting rules but with more clustering operations and the 


semantics of Discrete2 are meaningless as discussed in experiment one. Furthermore, the number of interesting rules found by Discrete1 is even less than Fuzzy+P that used the clustering operations least which illustrates the superiority of the method using fuzzy sets V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel fuzzy ARM algorithm called FFI_Stream is presented to tackle quantitative attributes in data streams and some techniques are proposed in the algorithm. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  In comparison with the discrete method, the proposed algorithm using fuzzy sets and MFB_measure gets a trade-off between the number of interesting rules and efficiency ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by The National High Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2008AA042902 Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 Program 2009AA04Z162 Project \(B07031 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Size of Databases\(250 N um be r o f F re qu e n t I

In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures. Figure 1 b cost for the sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
