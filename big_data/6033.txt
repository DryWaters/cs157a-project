It is possible that some web forums are not satisfied with these presumptions and cannot be dealt with this algorithm. And some meaningless sequences may be taken as hot topics mistakenly. However, in most cases, this algorithm which uses purely statistic approach, can work fast and accurately In future work, we would like to investigate more ways to build topics based on the founded LCSCS’, for the topic net is not understandable enough for ordinary user. The public opinions about hot topics would also be concerned.

Summary When frequent k-item set to generate frequent \(k+1 item set, the mode of intersection of any two sets is used in 4]. Pruning is not used in the paper, thus there are some operations which are not necessary to be done. So when the number of the frequent pattern needed to be found is very big or the amounts of data is very large, the efficiency of the algorithm will be greatly reduced. Pruning is first done in this paper, namely count the number of TID sets. If the 


number is less than min_sup, well delete the corresponding item set. When we do and operation on the candidate sets we can use apriori_gen algorithm to filter to reduce the counts of and operation and improve efficiency V. EXPERIMENT We use the classical data set, Mushroom Database as test data. This data set includes 8124 instances, 23 attributes and 127 kinds of values. When the support degree is large the Apriori algorithm takes little running time. However, the improved algorithm takes less time than it. With the reduction of the support degree, the performance of the improved algorithm will be better We use a data set including 8124 instances to do simulation experiment.

associated category in the rule database. Thus, each email should be classified into one category predefined If a unlabeled email can not fit all rules in the rule database, we will label it as unrecognized-mail. After labeled it by manual, a re-training will be performed, to update the rules database 4. Experimental Results Then, we arrange 1000 Chinese emails for the experiment, which are composed of 500 spam emails and 500 legitimate mails, all of them are labeled sexual, political advertising, personal, or working by manual. We take 800 emails as training samples, and 200 emails as test samples. In our experiment, the number of attributes extraction is 30. The experimental result of this research is recorded in Table 3 TABLE 3.

Conclusions In this paper, we propose an efficient email classification method based on decision tree data mining technique. We dig out the association rules among specific features in the email and apply these rules to label unknown emails category Different from those methods of checking the complete content of email, we judge email simply by its attributes without screening overall content of email. Obviously according to the datum of experiment, the efficiency of the method proposed in this paper is not lower than that of other present methods of checking email content. Meanwhile our method reduces the cost of computation and it wont

could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
