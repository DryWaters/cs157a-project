    AbstractIn this paper, we adopt a more sophisticated multi-objective approach, SPEA2, to find appropriate sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. The first one is to minimize the suitability of membership functions and the second one is to maximize the total number of large 1-itemsets An experimental comparison with the previous approach is also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding the Pareto-front membership functions I. INTRODUCTION Many approaches have been proposed for mining fuzzy association rules [1, 12, 19, 20, 24] in fuzzy data mining. The fuzzy mining algorithms developed earlier were mainly based on the Apriori algorithm and some based on the FP trees was recently developed. Fuzzy mining algorithms with multiple minimum supports of different items were developed as well 20]. Most of the previous fuzzy data mining algorithms assumed the membership functions were already known Pre-defined membership functions are not actually suitable in usage. Mining algorithms that can automatically derive both the appropriate membership functions and the fuzzy rules are thus required. Many approaches have thus been proposed for deriving membership functions in data mining [3, 4, 10, 11 15, 16 Besides, several criteria may be considered in a real application. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, that are used to find a set of solutions with trade-offs among different criteria, are thus very suitable for solving such a task 6, 7]. Kaya et al. proposed an approach that integrated the multi-objective genetic algorithm into clustering for fuzzy mining [17]. Kaya also proposed an approach based on multi-objective genetic algorithms for mining optimized fuzzy association rules [18]. We also proposed a fuzzy mining approach based on the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm \(MOGA membership functions [2 In this paper, we adopt a more sophisticated multi-objective approach, SPEA2 [25], to find the appropriate 


sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining.

It adopts a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions [25]. Two objective functions are used here to find the Pareto front of membership functions. The first one is to minimize the suitability of membership functions and the second one is to maximize the total number of large 1-itemsets. An experimental comparison with the previous approach is also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding the Pareto-front membership functions II. GA-BASED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS A multi-objective optimization problem can be defined as follows Min/Max y = g\(x g1\(x x x subject to x = \(x1, x2, ..., xn y1, y2, ..., ym where x is the decision vector, y is the objective vector, X represents the decision space, and Y represents the objective space. In the past, several GA-based approaches were proposed to get the solutions. For example, Schaffer proposed the Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm \(VEGA multi-objective optimization problem [22]. Fonseca et al proposed a modified approach called Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm \(MOGA rank-based fitness assignment [9]. They defined three relationships among chromosomes, namely inferiority 


superiority and non-inferiority. Besides, some variants of MOGA were also proposed. Two well-known approaches are NSGA-II [8] and SPEA2 [25]. Their main purpose was to get better Pareto fronts. NSGA-II used a fast non-dominated sorting procedure, an elitist strategy, and an approach without parameters to achieve this [8]. SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions [25 III. THE SPEA2-BASED MULTI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC-FUZZY MINING APPROACH In this paper, we propose a SPEA2-based approach to derive the set of non-dominated solutions for fuzzy mining problems. The details of the proposed approach are described below A. Chromosome Representation It is important to encode membership functions as string representation for GAs to be applied. Several possible encoding approaches have been described in [5, 21, 23]. In this paper, each membership function is assumed to be isosceles-triangle and represented by a pair \(c, w A SPEA2-based Genetic-Fuzzy Mining Algorithm Chun-Hao Chen, Tzung-Pei Hong and Vincent S. Tseng 978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE    indicating the center abscissa and w representing half the span All pairs of \(c, w represent its membership functions. Since both c and w are numeric values, a chromosome is thus encoded as a fixed-length real-number string rather than a bit string B. Initial Population A genetic algorithm requires a population of feasible solutions to be initialized and updated during the evolution process. As mentioned above, each individual within the population is a set of isosceles-triangular membership functions. Each membership function corresponds to a linguistic term in a certain item. The initial set of chromosomes is randomly generated with some constraints for forming feasible membership functions C. The Two Objective Functions 


Kaya et al. proposed an approach to derive membership functions for mining problems [15]. It could get a maximum profit \(maximum number of large itemsets of user specified minimum support values. The derived membership functions were then used to mine fuzzy association rules. In our previous work, we have also proposed a genetic-fuzzy approach to learn an appropriate set of membership functions for mining problems [11]. In that paper, the fitness values were evaluated by the numbers of large 1-itemsets over the suitability of membership functions The two factors \(numbers of large 1-itemsets and suitability of membership functions relationship. In this paper, we thus consider the mining of membership functions and fuzzy association rules as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the above two factors are used as two objectives functions. A SPEA2-based mining algorithm is thus proposed to find the Pareto optimal solutions. The first objective function \(Obj1 for a chromosome Cq is defined as follows   1 qq CysuitabilitCObj where suitability\(Cq membership functions with Cq. Suitability\(Cq  _ _ 1 qjqj m j CfactorcoverageCfactoroverlap  where m is the number of items. Overlap_factor\(Cqj represents the overlap factor of the membership functions for an item Ij in the chromosome Cq and is defined as    ik jijk jijk qj ww RRoverlap Cfactoroverlap ],1     


max _  where Rjk denotes the membership function of the k-th linguistic term of item Ij, overlap\(Rjk, Rji of Rjk and Rji. Coverage_factor\(Cqj ratio of a set of membership functions for an item Ij in the chromosome Cq and is defined as     1  1 j jlj qj I RRrangeCactorcoverage_f  where range\(Rj1, Rj2, , Rjl membership functions, l is the number of membership functions for Ij, and max\(Ij the transactions. The suitability factor is used to reduce the occurrence of the two bad kinds of membership functions where the first one is too redundant and the second one is too separate [11 The second objective function is the total number of large 1-itemsets in a given set of minimum support values {ms1 ms2, , msh}. It is formally defined as follows    h g ms qqq gL CtotalNumL1CObj 1 12  where || 1 g ms qL  is the number of large 1-itemsets obtained when the minimum support value is msg. Using the number of large 1-itemsets can achieve a trade-off between execution time 


and rule interestingness. Usually, a larger number of 1-itemsets will result in a larger number of all itemsets with a higher probability, which will thus usually imply more interesting association rules. In this paper, the proposed approach uses the above two objective functions to find appropriate Pareto solutions for the genetic-fuzzy mining problems D. Fitness Assignment The fitness assignment is similar to that used in SPEA2 25]. The fitness of a chromosome Cq is calculated by using the formula as follows f\(Cq Cq Cq where R\(Cq Cq the density information of a chromosome. The raw fitness is used to exhibit the strength of each chromosome, and is defined as follows qjPPjq jSCR   where the strength value S\(j dominates of chromosome Cj, and is calculated as follows S\(j where |?| means the cardinality of a set, + represents multiset union and the symbol ;  means the Pareto dominance relation. In other words, the raw fitness of a chromosome is determined by the strength of its dominators in both the population P and the archive P . Thus, the lower the raw fitness is, the better the chromosome is. The density information of a chromosome Cq is defined as follows 2 1   k q qCD  where ?qk is the distance of Cq to its k-th nearest chromosome in both the population P and the archive P , and k is calculated by NN + . The density information is used to distinguish the difference of chromosomes which have the same raw fitness    


E. Genetic Operators Genetic operators are important to the success of specific GA applications. Two genetic operators, the max-min-arithmetical \(MMA  the one-point mutation, are used in the proposed approach The MMA crossover operator will generate four candidate chromosomes from them. The best two chromosomes of the four candidates are then chosen as the offspring. The one-point mutation operator will create a new fuzzy membership function by adding a random value ? \(between wjk to + wjk linguistic term, say Rjk. Assume that c and w represent the center and the spread of Rjk. The center or the spread of the newly derived membership function will be changed to c or w + ? by the mutation operation. Mutation at the center of a fuzzy membership function may however disrupt the order of the resulting fuzzy membership functions. These fuzzy membership functions then need rearrangement according to their center values IV. THE PROPOSED MINING ALGORITHM The proposed SPEA2-based genetic-fuzzy minng algorithm for deriving both membership functions and fuzzy association rules is described below  INPUT: A body of n quantitative transactions, a set of m items, each with a number of linguistic terms, a set of minimum support values {ms1, ms2, , msh}, a population size N, an archive size N , a crossover rate Pc, a mutation rate Pm, a number of generation G and a confidence threshold OUTPUT: A set of non-dominated solutions \(sets of membership functions rules STEP 1: Randomly generate a population P of N individuals with each one being a set of membership functions for all the m items, encode each set of membership functions into a string representation according to the schema stated in Section 3, and initialize the non-dominated \(archive STEP 2: For each chromosome Cq, calculate its two objective values, the suitability and the total number of large 1-itemsets according to the given set of minimum 


support values {ms1, ms2, , msh}, by the following substeps SUBSTEP 2.1: For each transaction datum Di, i = 1 to n and for each item Ij, j = 1 to m, transfer the quantitative value vj\(i i as      jl i jl j i j j i j R f R f R f  2   2 1   1 using the corresponding membership functions represented by the chromosome, where Rjk is the k-th fuzzy region \(term i i membership value in region Rjk, and l \(= |Ij number of linguistic terms for Ij SUBSTEP 2.2: For each item region Rjk, calculate its scalar cardinality on the transactions as follows    


n i i jkjk fcount 1   SUBSTEP 2.3: For each Rjk , 1 ? j ? m, 1? k ? |Ij|, check whether countjk is larger than or equal to the set of minimum support values {ms1, ms2, , msh} . If Rjk satisfies the above condition, set || 1 gms qL  = || 1 g ms qL 1, where || 1 gms qL  is the number of large 1-itemsets obtained by using the set of membership functions in chromosome Cq and the minimum support value msg let the second objective value of Cq be the following    h g ms qq gL CtotalNumL1 1 1 SUBSTEP 2.4: Calculate the suitability value suitability\(Cq by using the formula defined in Section 3; set it as the first objective value of Cq STEP 3: Calculate the raw fitness R\(Cq Cq by using the formula defined in Section III STEP 4: Calculate the density information D\(Cq chromosome Cq by using the formula defined in Section III STEP 5: Set the fitness value of each chromosome as follows f\(Cq Cq Cq STEP 6: Copy nondominated chromosomes to archive P . In other words, the chromosomes with their fitness 


values smaller than one will be copied to the archive STEP 7: Execute environmental selection according to the number of chromosomes in the archive. There are three cases 1 P | equals to N , go to the next step 2 is smaller than N , select the best \( N - | P dominated chromosomes with their fitness values larger than one from the previous population and archive 3 the archive exceeds N , use the truncation operator to reduce the size of the archive. At each iteration the chromosome Cq with the smallest ?qk, which is the distance of Cq to its k-th nearest chromosome in the archive, is removed until | P | = N . In case of many chromosomes have the same minimum distance, the second smallest distance is chosen for removal, and so on STEP 8: Use the selection operation to choose appropriate individuals from the archive P  to form the next generation. Here, the binary tournament selection is performed STEP 9: Execute the crossover operation on the population STEP 10: Execute the mutation operation on the population    STEP 11: If the termination criterion is not satisfied, go to Step 2; otherwise, do the next step STEP 12: Mine fuzzy association rules from the given database and based on the derived chromosomes in archive P , where each chromosome represents a set of membership functions. The fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in [13] is then adopted to achieve this purpose for each set of membership functions STEP 13: Output the archive P  and their corresponding fuzzy association rules V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section, experiments made to show the performance 


of the proposed approach are described. A simulation dataset with 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. The dataset followed the exponential distribution. The initial population size P is set at 50, the archive size is set at 30, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate pm is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al.s paper [14] and the set of minimum support values is {3 4%, , 13%}. The experiments were first made for demonstrating the evolution of the Pareto fronts by the proposed approach. The evolution of the Pareto fronts of chromosomes in the archive along with different generations by the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1 From Fig. 1, we can observe that the solutions were distributed on the Pareto fronts and the final solutions after 500 generations were better than those in different generations. Besides, we can also found that the derived solutions on a Pareto front are trade-offs between the two objectives. It thus depends on the user preference to decide which solutions on a Pareto front are desired. The experiment was then made for comparing the final Pareto front of chromosomes in the archive of the proposed approach with the previous approach [2], and is shown in Fig. 2  250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Suitability To tal N um be r o f L 1

Comparison results of final Pareto fronts between the proposed approach and the previous approach  From Fig. 2, it is easily to know that the Pareto front derived by using the proposed approach is better than the previous one.  From the experimental results, we thus can conclude that the proposed approach is not only effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions, but also can provide different options to users for further analysis VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The SPEA2 adopted a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method to derive better Pareto solutions 25]. In this paper, we have utilized it to propose a more sophisticated multi-objective approach to find the appropriate sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. They are minimizing the suitability of membership functions and maximizing the total number of large 1-itemsets respectively Experiments on a simulation dataset were also made to 


show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions. Further, the experiments also show that the proposed approach can derive better Pareto front than the previous one [2]. In the future, we will continuously enhance the multi-objective genetic-fuzzy approach for more complex problems REFERENCES 1] C. C. Chan and W. H.

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1

But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.

But this time, users require that different 


members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
