ata is pouring into the hands of cancer researchers 
thanks to improvements in imaging, models, and understanding of genetics. Today, the data from a single patient\222s tumor in a clinical trial can add up to one Tbyte, the equivalent of 130,000 books But we don\222t yet have the tools to e\037ciently process the mountain of genetic data to make more precise predictions for therapy. And it\222s needed: treating cancer remains a com plex moving target. We can\222t yet say precisely how a speci\036c 
tumor will react to any given drug, and as a patient is treated cancer cells can continue to evolve, making the initial therapy less e\035ective Toward this goal, the US Department of Energy \(DOE is partnering with the National Cancer Institute in an \223all government\224 approach to \036ghting cancer. Part of this part nership is a three-year pilot project called the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer \(JDACSC 
which will use DOE supercomputing to build sophisticated computational models to facilitate breakthroughs in the \036ght against cancer on the molecular, patient, and population levels 034e pilot builds on US President Barack Obama\222s Pre cision Medicine Initiative and Vice President Joe Biden\222s recent \223Cancer Moonshot\224 to transition cancer therapy away from a \223one size \036ts all\224 approach. Instead, the goal 
is to move toward individualized diagnosis and treatment that accommodates a patient\222s unique body chemistry and genetics 223Cancer researchers are very good at generating all types of data, from genomic data, proteomic data, and im aging data,\224 said Warren Kibbe, director of the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology at the National Cancer Institute. \223What we\222re not really good at yet is integrating all that information into a consistent model 
 and making predictions on how a tumor will respond to a given treatment.\224 Editors: James J. Hack, jhack@ornl.gov | Michael E. Papka, papka@anl.gov 


80   March/April 2017 CANDLE Patient Level Key to this collaboration is a computational frame work called the CANcer Distributed Learning En vironment \(CANDLE\. Over the years, many proj ects have amassed a huge volume of cancer data including tumor genomes, patient data, and experi ments on potential drugs. CANDLE is designed to use machine learning algorithms to \036nd patterns in large datasets. Machine learning is a type of ar ti\036cial intelligence that focuses on developing pro grams that can teach themselves to grow and change when presented with new data. \034ese patterns o\035er insights that could ultimately result in improved treatment or guidance on new experiments To date, machine learning studies have pro duced computational models that estimate drug response for a singular data point\227say, a certain mutation. Researchers working with CANDLE however, envision a higher degree of complexity that integrates many types of information, such as drug interactions and speci\036cs about a patient\222s genealogy, as well as the tumor\222s molecular charac teristics and how its protein expression varies over time 223\034e research community has collected thou sands of experiments with hundreds of thousands of data points characterizing tumors and their response to the drugs,\224 said Rick Stevens, an as sociate laboratory director at the DOE\222s Argonne National Laboratory and professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. \223By working with the national laboratories, the National Can cer Institute can now \036nally scale and quantify the cancer problem.\224 Using this computational architecture, partici pating labs\227Argonne, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge national laboratories\227 will focus on three problems singled out by the Na tional Cancer Institute as the biggest bottlenecks to advancing cancer research. \034e three pilot proj ects are aimed at understanding key protein inter actions, predicting drug response, and automating patient information extraction to inform treatment strategies Each pilot looks at cancer from a di\035erent scale. Lawrence Livermore drives the molecularlevel pilot, Argonne leads the patient-level pilot Oak Ridge undertakes the population-level pilot and Los Alamos looks at uncertainty quanti\036ca tion across all three pilots Molecular Level 034irty percent of all cancers exhibit mutations in the Ras family, a collection of proteins that help trigger cellular machinery to make new cells or kill old ones 034e molecular-level pilot work being led by a team at Lawrence Livermore will use the CANDLE architecture to predict how these proteins behave on the top of cell membranes. \034e team will then apply this knowledge to what researchers describe as the \223Ras pathway problem,\224 where glitches cause genes to remain stuck in the \223on\224 position, leading to cancerous tumors Researchers want to produce highly complex simulations that describe how a protein moves and binds to speci\036c locations on the cell membrane 034ey hope such insights can be applied to the mil lions of Ras pathways and dramatically enhance our understanding of how they work by predicting the likelihood that a signal will take a certain path Cancer encompasses hundreds of diseases, each with thousands of possible causes. \034us, bringing precision to therapy selection for a speci\036c patient is the goal of the Argonne-led patient-level pilot With the CANDLE platform, researchers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE O\037ce of Science User facility, will develop predictive models that guide drug treatment choices  for tumors based on a much wider assortment of data than is currently used To do this, they\222ll merge one type of compu tational model that uses data to predict phenom ena with another model that uses data to explain them. \034e hope is that by merging these two meth ods, they\222ll be able to migrate lessons learned from computer simulations to the research laboratory where researchers test mice to verify the computer\222s prediction of how a tumor will respond to a given therapy To date, machine learning studies have produced computational models that estimate drug response for a singular data point\227say, a certain mutation 


Justin H.S. Breaux www.computer.org/cise    Over the next three years, both the National Can cer Institute and DOE have a monumental task but they have a plan 034e \036rst year will focus on merging statistical models and building machine learning methods that make the best of their ability to explain and predict phenomena. In the second year, computer scientists will have to computationally estimate how con\036dent they are in those predictions and in the \036nal year, researchers will put all these pieces together and integrate experimental design 223I really think we are at a unique place right now. \034ere are some unbelievably great conver sations happening across government right now about how we work together and integrate these Researchers will also try to \036nd mechanisms for how a particular tumor evades a therapy or de velops resistance 223Conceptually, that\222s how we\222re thinking the future of cancer therapies is going to move. Right now, we don\222t understand the biological implica tions of resistance well enough for any particular therapy to do a good job at predicting combinato rial therapies,\224 said Kibbe. \223We think that simula tion will allow us to do a much better job of pre dicting which combination of therapies would be most e\035ective for a speci\036c patient.\224 At any one point in time, 3 to 5 percent of patients with cancer participate in a cancer clinical trial but cataloguing all this data is still a manual task Oak Ridge will help the National Cancer In stitute scale its ability to monitor cancer patients across the country by automating the process of entering and extracting information. By apply ing natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to these millions of clinical reports, computers will be able to derive meaning from the notes that doctors and nurses write in their reports Once completed, this system will automatically  analyze and extract information so that research ers can monitor country-wide outcomes, which can then inform treatment strategies for patients of di\035erent lifestyles, environments, and cancer types Steps are being taken to de-identify data before population-level pilot data is shared with partici pating labs, Stevens said is a science writer and social media specialist at Argonne National Laboratory. His interests include communicating di\037cult topics to unsuspecting audiences, \036guring out how to make a video go viral and learning Spanish.
