In the past, this problem has been addressed by approaches relying on static, dynamic and textual analysis. Recently, techniques based on historical analysis and association rules have been explored This paper proposes a novel change impact analysis method based on the idea that the mutual relationships between software objects can be inferred with a statistical learning approach. We use the bivariate Granger causality test, a multivariate time series forecasting approach used to verify whether past values of a time series are useful for predicting future values of another time series Results of a preliminary study performed on the Samba daemon show that change impact relationships inferred with the Granger causality test are complementary to those inferred with association rules. This opens the road towards the development of an eclectic impact analysis approach conceived by combining di?erent techniques Categories and Subject Descriptors D.2.7 [Software Engineering]: Distribution, Maintenance and EnhancementVersion control General Terms Measurements Keywords Mining Software Repositories, Change Impact Analysis 1. INTRODUCTION Change impact analysis is the process of determining the 


set of software artifacts likely to be changed when \(or after one artifact has been changed.

Recently, the availability of data from versioning systems and bug tracking systems opened the road towards a new software analysis perspective, namely historical analysis, which adds complementary information to what available with static and dynamic analysis, i.e., information about changes occurring to software artifacts over time, about artifacts changing together, about who performed a change, and why the change was made Ying et al. [9] proposed a technique to determine the impact of changes based on association rules. Such technique learns change impact relations based on the co-changes of software artifacts. The underlying idea is that a change occurring to a software artifact a is likely to impact another artifact b if in the past they changed together. This kind of historical analysis is often able to capture change coupling that might not be captured by means of traditional \(static and dynamic thus a change to one in?uences the otherwhile not having an explicit control or data dependency. Examples are change coupling between high level artifacts \(e.g., requirements code ?les belonging to di?erent features sharing something e.g., GUI style, licenses, database access necessarily be captured through data and control-?ow dependencies. While such technique has proven successful 


in capturing change relations among artifacts co-changing within a single change set [10], it fails to capture change relations having a consequentiality spread over a larger interval of time This paper proposes the use of a Vector AutoRegression VAR sion \(AR pendencies between multiple time series. In particular, we use the bivariate Granger causality test [4] to identify if the changes of a software artifact are useful to forecasting the changes of another software artifact. For a couple of software artifacts, a and b, an equation explains the change evolution of a based on its past changes and the past changes of b then, a statistical test shows whether the past changes of a are useful for predicting changes to b The bivariate Granger causality test has been successfully used in bioinformatics for identifying gene regulatory relationships [8], while to the best of our knowledge it has 163 not been applied yet to study software evolution phenomena where, up to now, univariate time series models have been used to predict software metrics and changes [6 Preliminary results obtained over 10531 snapshots of Samba suggest that Granger causality helps to capture change impacts in a complementary way with respect to association rules: while the latter captures relations between source code ?les changing together, the former identi?es temporal causality relations among changing artifacts The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of existing historical approaches, based on association rules, to identify the impact of changes [9]. Then, it introduces the proposed change impact analysis approach based on the bivariate Granger causality test. Section 3 reports and discusses results from a preliminary empirical study performed on Samba. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper and overviews challenges and potential applications of the technique 2. CHANGE IMPACT PREDICTIONWITH HISTORICAL ANALYSIS The evolution of a software system, S = {f1, f2, . . . , fK under the control of a versioning system can be viewed as a sequence of source code Snapshots generated by a sequence 


of Change Sets, ?1,?2, . . . ,?T . A change set, ?t, represents the changes performed by a developer on a set of source les, ?t ? S, at time t. Change sets can be extracted from a versioning \(e.g., CVS or SVN ample a time-windowing approach, that considers a change set as a sequence of ?le revisions that share the same author branch, and commit notes, and such that the di?erence between the timestamps of two subsequent commits is less than or equal to 200 seconds [10]. Historical analysis of a software system consists of extracting useful information from change set data In this section we recall a consolidated historical analysis approach for predicting change impacts, i.e., the use of association rules, and then we show how the bivariate Granger causality test can be used as a novel approach to predict change impacts. We assume the following de?nition of change impact relation from source ?le fi to fj , with i = j fj is impacted by a change in fi \(fi  fj change performed in fi will generate a change in fj in at least K, with K ? 0, ahead change sets 2.1 Association Rules Association rule discovery is an unsupervised learning technique used for local pattern detection showing attribute value conditions that occur together in a given dataset [1]. The application of association rule mining to change impact prediction assumes a dataset composed by a sequence of change sets, e.g., source ?les, that have been committed together within an interval of time into a versioning repository [10 9]. An association rule, Fleft ? Fright, between two disjoint source ?le sets means that if a change occurs in each fi ? Fleft, then another change should happens in each fj ? Fright within the same change set. The strength of an association rule is determined by its con?dence and support [1], de?ned as Support Fleft ? Fright T Con?dence Fleft ? Fright Fleft where T is the total number of change sets extracted from the versioning repository and |F | is the number of change 


sets, ?t, where F ? ?t, i.e., the source ?les in F changed together To ?nd the pair of source ?les, fi and fj , such that fi  fj i.e. fj is impacted by a change in fi con?dence and support for each fi, fj ? S, with i = j, and consider the top N of the list of source ?le pairs ranked by their con?dence and support in decreasing order 2.2 Granger Causality Granger causality test is a technique for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another [4]. It has become popular in recent years in bioinformatics to discover gene and metabolic pathways of an organism [8]. The basic idea is that a cause cannot come after the e?ect, then if a variable x a?ects a variable z, the former should help improving the predictions of the latter variable. We use this notion to capture whether changes performed in a source le could cause, in a Granger sense, a change in another source ?le. Let fk\(t of the source ?le fk de?ned as fk\(t 8  1, fk ? ?t 0, fk /? ?t i.e., fk\(t otherwise.

PRELIMINARY EMPIRICAL RESULTS This section reports an empirical study we performed with the aim of getting preliminary insights about the proposed change impact analysis approach. The goal of this study is to analyze to what extent Granger causality can be used as a complement to association rules to predict source code ?les change impact by using data from versioning systems. The quality focus is the increase of precision / recall in predicting change impacts, as well as the capability of di?erent techniques to detect complementary change impact sets. The perspective is of a maintainer interested to understand what 


les could be potentially a?ected by changes occurring in a given ?le. The context consists of change sets extracted from the versioning history of Samba1a well-known ?le and print service developed to ensure interoperability between Microsoft Windows and Unixes. Speci?cally, we analyzed 10531 snapshots, from release 1.9.16 to release 3.0.0 and restricted our analysis to ?les belonging to the Samba daemon \(i.e., smbd only 5265 dict change impacts, using the actual changes occurring in these snapshots as an oracle for evaluating the performances of our prediction Figure 1 shows, for di?erent values of top-n \(i.e., links with highest strength, increasing from the left to the right for di?erent techniques \(association rules, Granger causality, and the combination of both recall obtained when identifying the change impact of a class. Precision is de?ned as the ratio between the number predicted true changes and the total number of predicted changes, while recall is de?ned as the ratio between the number of predicted true changes and the total number of true changes As it can be seen, for lower values of n Granger starts with a high precision \(90 increasing top-n to about 70%, without positively increasing the recall. The precision for association rules starts lower 1http://www.samba.org       1  2 3 4 5 3 6 7 8

Finally, the precision for the combination of the two techniques starts very high 100%, with, however, few links retrieved to ? 75%, and ?nally rises again to ? 82%. Overall, the combination of both techniques seems to exhibit the best precision/recall compromise, i.e., to start with a very high precision, but then to keep it as high as association rules The complementarity of the two techniques is even more evident when looking at Figure 2, which shows, for di?erent values of top-n, the number of true impacts found by Granger causality \(and not found by association rules association rules \(and not by Granger causality found by both techniques at the same time. This ?gure shows that the intersection between the two techniques is always lower \(from 7 vs 37 and 31 for top-100, up to 25 vs 50 and 56 for top-200 one technique only Finally, Figure 3 shows an excerpt of an impact graph highlighting impact relations identi?ed by association rules plain lines dotted lines bold lines related to Samba authentication \(auth_*.c responsible of handling errors providing requests

Changes performed to auth_* ?les immediately impact on reply.c and on uid.c, as shown by relations identi?ed by association rules. Instead, the graph shows that changes are propagated only after a while to error.c: in fact the change impact relation is identi?ed by Granger causality only. For instance, on Aug 8, 2001 both auth_* ?les and reply.c \(revision 1.316 note \(smbd/auth server: Doco we want to use cli nt error here soon smbd/password.c management needs to be updated soon.

Our approach is purely statistical, hence there is no guarantee to ensure source code change causality. Also, the study can su?er of threats to external validity, as this is only one, small preliminary study. Further, larger studies are desirable to better assess the performances and the scalability of the proposed approach 4. EMERGING RESEARCH DIRECTIONS Driven by bioinformatics, where the Granger causality test is largely used to derive causal relationships among different elements, such as genes and proteins, we have developed a novel change impact analysis method that uses the Granger causality test to learn impact relationships among software artifacts. The main idea of the method is to infer the mutual dependencies between software artifacts by measuring the statistical con?dence that the time series representing the history of changes of a software artifact can be used to predict the changes of another artifact. The problem is therefore posed as a statistical test, evaluating the quality 


of forecasting of a variable given another one In this paper the method has been compared with the application of association rules [9, 10], and the preliminary results suggest that the Granger causality test can be a viable approach to change impact analysis, as it complements existing approaches. As a matter of fact, while association rules capture co-changes, Granger causality helps learning consequent changes. While not shown in this paper for the sake of space, we have compared the results of the proposed impact analysis method against traditional methods based on static analysis, and also in this case we found that they are able to highlight complementary, yet useful, impact relationships. This opens the way towards an eclectic impact analysis approach that combines existing methods, to overcome the limitation of the individual methods, and provides software engineers with a richer set of information useful to assess the impact of a change There are several directions in which the work presented here can be expanded. Of course, a ?rst direction is the development of further empirical studies to fully understand advantages and limitation of the proposed method, to compare it with other \(traditional and to develop heuristics for improvement The application of Granger causality depends entirely on the appropriate selection of variables. In this paper we have used an impulsive \(0,1 in a snapshot. However, other variables should be explored for example the variation of some metric values. Furthermore, the method could be applied for object-oriented system, considering classes and methods instead of functions We are interested to compare the Granger causality approach against the dynamic Bayesian network inference, which is a well-known approach used to derive causal relationships. Finally, we are investigating the use of information theoretic approaches based on mutual information 5. REFERENCES 1] R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. N. Swami.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
