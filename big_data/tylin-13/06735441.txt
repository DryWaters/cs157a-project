Extensible Video Processing Framework in Apache Hadoop 
Digital video is prominent big data spread all over 
Abstract 
  
the Internet It is large not only in size but also in required processing power to extract useful information Fast processing of excessive video reels is essential on criminal investigations such as terrorism This demo presents an extensible video processing framework in Apache Hadoop to parallelize video processing tasks in a cloud environment Except for video transcoding systems there have been few systems that can perform various video processing in cloud computing environments The framework employs FFmpeg for a video coder and OpenCV for a image processing engine To optimize the performance it exploits MapReduce implementation details to 
minimize video image copy Moreover FFmpeg source code was modiìed and extended to access and exchange essential data and information with Hadoop effectively A face tracking system was implemented on top of the framework for the demo which traces the continuous face movements in a sequence of video frames Since the system provides a web-based interface people can try the system on site In an 8-core environment with two quad-core systems the system shows 75 of scalability 
I I NTRODUCTION As smart phones and digital surveillance video systems ourish video becomes one of the dominant big-data appli 
cations From surveillance video we may want to identify and track the suspects In a user-video database automatic face recognition can be an attractive application Video data are not just large in size but also in required processing power To extract meaningful information from a video such as facial signatures massive process per image is needed while the entire video reel may have an excessively long sequence of images However such processing must be timely performed in mission-critical applications For instance of 2011 Vancouver ice hockey nal riot the police inspected 1600 hour video and a million images to identify the prime suspects In such cases investigation must be 
completed in a couple of days in general Consequently Video data processing is highly suitable to adopt a cloud computing environment such as Apache Hadoop which conveniently parallelize the processing In this demo we present a parallel video processing framework in the Apache Hadoop cloud-computing environment This work is supported by the the Gyeonggi Regional Collaboration Research Center GRRC-KA Apache Hadoop is the most popular big-data cloudcomputing environment whose source code is freely accessible in public It implements a distributed fault-tolerant le system called HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System and the MapReduce distributed processing pattern Our video 
processing framework is also based on both HDFS and MapReduce pattern It reads a video reel from HDFS and distributes the reel in the cloud for a process using MapReduce pattern To process the video it rst decompresses the stream using modiìed FFmpeg library and processes the uncompressed image sequences with the OpenCV library to extract essential information Since FFmpeg and OpenCV are in C language without a concern of Hadoop environment in Java extensions of the libraries were required which are found to be nontrivial In our best knowledge it is the rst extensible video-processing framework that modiìes FFmpeg library to optimize for the Hadoop environment even though there are a couple of video transcoding systems 
in Hadoop without off-the-shelf use of FFmpeg executable   To demonstrate our framework we implemented a face tracking system in which each sequence of the same personês faces in a continuous motion is collected and grouped automatically It can be one of basic features in facial information extraction from surveillance video data The paper is organized as follows We rst introduce the basic concepts and related work in video-related cloud systems in Section 2 In the following section we explain our framework and technical challenges we met Section 4 describes our demo system and evaluates experimental results We conclude our work in Section 5

In our framework Video processing is performed at stage of the MapReduce pattern At the reduce stage the proccessed data can be reìned Fig 1 illustrates the architecture of our demonstration framework The system has three layers Hadoop subsystem Figure 2 Namenode/Datanode and JobTracker/TaskTracker FFmpeg subsystem and the image processor from the bottom to the top between which the interfaces bridge Hadoop manages the cloud system based on the MapReduce pattern It decomposes the video processing job into GOP elements and distributes them to the cloud nodes Each GOP element metadata is handed to the FFmpeg library FFmpeg decodes a GOP into a sequence of images and passes them to the pluggable image processor one-by-one The image processor processes the image sequence and manufactures processed images in structure To implement a video processing cloud system the video decoder must be able to read a video le in HDFS There can be a couple of ways to pass video data to the video decoder First Hadoopês MapReduce engine can read and pass the video data to FFmpeg Second Hadoop can just point out the section to decode to FFmpeg and FFmpeg directly reads the video data from HDFS To optimize the performance we chose the second option in spite that it needs an FFmpeg extension in video I/O subsystem to allow direct access to HDFS The HDFS related portion of our framework is the left half of the framework in Fig 1 FFmpeg extension for HDFS was required to be developed because HDFS has only dedicated interfaces without a support of standard le APIs Linux FUSE package was another option which is a third party interface providing standard le APIs for HDFS Since a Hadoop-based transcoder uses Linux FUSE package we measured the performance of the Linux FUSE package as an option for the framework However we decided to extend FFmpeg for a direct HDFS access not using the FUSE package because it has signiìcant performance losses Our extension is not only faster than FUSE package but also much stabler we found

Hadoop MapReduce distributed processing engine in Hadoop is a programming model to process big data in largely distributed computing nodes Hadoop MapReduce has the Master node called JobTracker and the slaves called TaskTracker Their relationship is similar to the one between the NameNode and the DataNodes in HDFS The relationship between NameNode DataNodes JobTracker and TaskTrackers are depicted in Fig 2 JobTracker gets a Job usually a large problem from a client and slices it into small sub-problems each called  Each is allocated to a TaskTracker which consecutively performs a map function for each entry in the split Once a TaskTracker completes the allocated split an additional split is assigned if remained Performance of a MapReduce job considerably depends on how to divide a input le into s The size of a split is better to be smaller to maximize parallelism but should be larger to minimize maintenance overheads Consequently it is important to nd proper compromise for the size of a split Notice that an cannot scale down to a picture frame because a frame in a video is dependent upon other nearby frames in decoding Since the smallest independent decoding unit in video les is a GOP the smallest split unit is also a GOP Once a GOP is assigned to a TaskTracker as an  it will decode the frames in the GOP and process each image sequentially When deciding the size of an  it is better to be synchronized with a le block Once it is synchronized the JobTracker can distribute the split to the node that has the block as it can be read and processed within the node Otherwise the split must be requested remotely In this study we adjust each to be closely match with a le block However if each split is exactly the same as a le block the splitês starting point may not accord with a GOP starting point Since a split cannot be ner than a GOP a split boundary must be at a GOP boundary Thereby our framework divides an at the GOP boundary just after the block boundary With this strategy each split will closely synchronize with a le block with minimal off-block data As long as the JobTracker allocates a split to TaskTrackers that have the split locally data-process locality can be established and remote le access can be minimal only for the off-block data How to Figure 4 Output of our face tracing demo system divide each is depicted in Fig 3 To perform such splits the framework must be aware of the GOP boundary positions However FFmpeg does not provide APIs providing such information Moreover the framework must be able to process the video from the location in the byte precision Hence we extended FFmpeg to support GOP information retrievals and byte-precision video seek functionality to enable our design as shown in Fig 1 OpenCV is the most popular image processing library to get numerical or meaningful information from high dimensional image data in the real world OpenCV is composed of programing functions to process image data In our work OpenCV is not a mendatory but recommended image processing environment Once a video frame is decoded into a still image the image is directly passed to the image processor in C or C native environment If the Hadoop Java environment intervenes the image handover there must be copies of images between the native and JVM memory spaces Thereby we put the image processing layer just on top of the FFmpeg video decoding layer to optimize performance Besides our face-tracing demo system other image processing applications can be applied because it has a pluggable architecture IV F ACE TRACING DEMO SYSTEM IN A VIDEO We developed a demo application that extracts representative faces and traces continuous faces over the frames to show the performance and practicality of our framework The representative faces are listed for their own sets The criteria of facial continuity are positions of faces and similarity of facial contrast distributions As illustrated in Fig 4 All the faces in the video are detected by the OpenCV face detector and the continuous faces are traced and grouped Because demonstration system for this demo program is produced with web-based interface users can directly operate the system We measured the performance of the system by comparing the processing time of a multi-core cloud system with a single-core system

We use other than because the latter is always in the center of the node s affiliated data points. In the scenario of incremental clustering, the distance from to may be too large. As a result, even though micro-cluster is homologous to node i.e. it should be affiliated to node it is still wrongly identified as distinct This problem is similar to the ones illustrated by Fig.1 However is constantly shifting to the potential position where the next homologous micro-cluster may appear Algorithm3 line 16    Similarly, the distance between two nodes  is defined as 1 1    8 The agglomerative radius of the node is a vital parameter for identifying homologous micro-clusters.

As is discussed in Part B of Section II, the sequential operations constrain the parallelism. In the sequential part, the micro-clusters can only be processed one by one, which is similar to the point-wise processing pattern Algorithm 2\ our algorithm, only 0 1 sequential operations are needed. But for this moderate-granularity algorithm, the point-wise algorithm would have to do  sequential operations. Thus, higher and lower are more favorable All experiments are done on a platform equipped with an IntelÆ Core2 TM E7500 CPU, and a NVIDIA GTX 660 GPU The main memory size of CPU is 2GB. Linux of 2.6.18194.el5 kernel is used with gcc 4.1.2 and CUDA5.0  Three 256-color grayscale images from the Rawzor benchmark are used as the input: artificial.pgm \(3072 000h 2048\es_iso_200.pgm \(3008 000h 2000\ and fireworks.pgm \(3136 000h 2352\ These images are transferred into 6291456, 6016000, 7375872 data points, respectively Each data point is a three-dimension vector, whose components are X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, and the grayscale. Note that our way of formatting data points is different from the method in  Every image is divided into a certain number of tiles Take artificial.pgm as an example, it is divided in the following way: 1\e image is divides into five 3072 000h 400 tiles and a 3072 000h 48 tile; 2\e first five tiles are spliced into one 15360 000h 400 tile, keeping their original order; 3 the 15360 000h 400 tile is separated into 400 000h 400 tiles and a 160 000h 400 tile; 4\ except the thirty-eight 400 000h 400 tiles, there are 3072 000h 48+160 000h 400=211456 pixels; 5 keeping the original order of the pixels and obeying the row-major sequence, these 211456 pixels are split into  160000-pixel tile and 51456-pixel tile. Overall, this image is divided into forty tiles. The other images are divided into tiles in a similar way. A comparatively large tile size \(1.6 000h 10 4 adopted , because we want to alter the micro-clustersê granularity by tuning the bandwidth parameters of mean-shift. If the tile size is too small, the size of the micro-clusters will be small even if large bandwidths are used. Each tile serves as a data block With regards to the benchmark and parallel-friendly part of our algorithm, the uniform kernel is used. The bath meanshift algorithm is run on CPU, and its output is the benchmark of accuracy. The sequential part of our algorithm is run on CPU; the parallel-friendly part is run on CPU and GPU, respectively. For the GPU code, CUDA grid size is 5 and CUDA block size is 256.

The vertical axis is  and both achieve the top when 4 4. As the granularity grows, their decline at least obviously or even significantly reaches top when 10 8. As the granularity rises to 12 10, its also decreases. The final cluster numbers are shown in Table I. With regards to the cluster number obtained by incremental clustering is 1.48 times as large as that of the benchmark, but its top is 1.17 dB higher than the benchmark. For its top is 5.36 dB lower than the benchmark, but its cluster number is 48.3% of the benchmarkês. Likewise can achieve the 2.9 dB lower top with the 21.5% smaller cluster number Segmentation results of the benchmark and our algorithm are shown in Fig.5 \(at the end of this paper\. From Fig.3, Table I and Fig.5, we can see that our algorithm achieves comparable accuracy to the benchmark                 Fig.3 PSNR  TABLE I  rises significantly. Even when the granularity is small, a considerable part of computation still can be done on GPU decreases at least obviously or even significantly, which means higher parallelism-scalability. Even when the granularity is small, the can be as low as the magnitude of 10 3 The operation of Algorithm3 line 13 actually involves a loop \(similar to Algorithm2 line 4 to 6\. Actually, it can be parallelized on GPU, but the GPUês computing capability is very likely to be underutilized. A lower means a shorter time span during which the GPU is underutilized Currently, the problem of how to select suitable bandwidth parameters still remains to be investigated. However, even if the bandwidths are manually set to small values \(for example 4 4\ the accuracy is still comparable to the benchmark Compared to the block-wise algorithm, our algorithm does not need a predefined searching range of the cluster number avoids redundant computing, and is more likely to achieve high accuracy. Compared to the point-wise algorithm, our algorithm is more parallelism-scalable due to much higher and much smaller  In all, our algorithm can benefit from both the block-wise patternês and the point-wise patternês advantages             Fig. 4 Parallel-friendly rate and shrinking rate TABLE II C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper we present our work towards a moderategranularity incremental clustering algorithm.
