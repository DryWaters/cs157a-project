I  I NTRODUCTION  Due to recent advances in remote sensing instruments the number of spectral bands used in these instruments to collect data has significantly increa sed. The advances of sensor technologies make it possible to utilize a growing number of spectral bands. High-dimensional remote sensing data sets obtained from multispectral, hyperspectral or even ultraspectral bands generally provide enormous spectral information for data analysis. But this improved spectral resolution also comes at a price, known as the 
The term

is used by the statistical community to describe the difficulties associated with the feasibility of distribution estimation in high-dimensional data sets. The datasets cover an abundance of applications from satellite remote sensing imaging to medical examination imaging. World-wide researchers all report the difficulties, regarding its dis tribution estimation Accordingly, how to extract the most valuable and meaningful information has become much more essential  Pearson proposed a principal component analysis \(PCA  to c onver t a set o f cor r el ate d h ighd i m e n s i o na l da ta

 Figure 1. An example illustrating \(a\ an original CMPM and \(b\ its corresponding correlation matrix for class  CMPM\ is used to emphasize the second-order statistics in hyperspectral data and to illustrate the magnitude of correlation matrices in the proposed PPSO method. In our previous works, we proposed a GME set which is composed of a group of modular eigenspaces for the class as also shown in Fig. 1. Reordering the bands regardless of the original order in terms of wavelengths in high-dimensional data sets is an important characteristic of the GME. Each modular eigenspace includes a set of highly correlated bands In hyperspectral imagery, GME has been developed by clustering highly correlated hyperspectral bands into a smaller subset of band modular based on greedy algorithm PSO\is a swarm intelligence algorithm originally designed to solve the nonlinear function optimization and neural network training problems [6 SO sc h e m e  i s a w e l l kn ow n m e th od t o so lv e the heuristic optimization problems. PPSO band selection [5 can group highly correlated bands of hyperspectral images into several high corrected modules. However, the PPSO is difficult to identify which bands are the most significant bands in each high corrected module for the image classification. IFBP [5 is i n corporate d with  PPSO ba nd selection to improve the band prioritization while increasing classification accuracy After applying PPSO band selection to hyperspectral images, the IFBP is then deployed for band prioritization. A visualization of the IFBP method is shown in Fig 2. There are two classes \(A and B\ and two bands and this example. In Fig. 3, one training sample of class A and three  training  samples  of class  B  are  overlapped  within  the two   Figure 3. A visualization of the proposed IFBP method

 the most important feature bands are selected, including Band #1, #2, #4 and #5 in this case, as shown in Fig. 7  As a result, the highly corr elated bands of hyperspectral imagery can be grouped first into the some modules by PPSO band selection algorithm to coarsely reduce highdimensional datasets, and these highly correlated band modules can then be analyzed with the statistical relationship between bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the most important feature bands form the datasets  The natural parallelism of proposed PSO is in the face that each particle can be regarded as an independent agent Parallel computation benefits the algorithm by providing each agent with one of the parallel proces e intrinsic parallel characteristics embedded in the proposed PPSO can be therefore suitable for a parallel implementation Fig.8 illustrates a data flow comparison between PSO and parallel PSO approaches  III E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this paper, two plantation areas are chosen for investigation. They are the MASTER set of Au-Ku and the AVIRIS set of Northwest Tippecanoe County \(NTC\. At Au-Ku data set, 30 training samples and 120 testing samples for each class with 44 bands, there were 6 classes in this data set; at NTC data set, 20 training samples and 80 testing samples for each class with 220 bands, there were 9 classes in this data set. Five correlation coefficient \(CC\thresholds 0 7 0 9 with a offset of 0.05, were selected to carry out the experiments. The parameters used for PSO are initialized as follows. The inertia weight \002 is set as 0.8 to 0.4. The acceleration constants \(cognitive confidence coefficients 1 is 2 and c 2 is 1.25. All of the multiple combinations of parameters stated above are averaged to obtain the experimental results    Figure 9.The DRR with different thresholds of CC     Figure 10.The VCA with diffe rent thresholds of CC   The VCA DRR\4 ined  i n Eq. 1, a re used to verification the performances of proposed method   1  where represent the total number of bands, and  represent the number of selection bands  Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 summarize the evaluation results of qualities of solutions to illustrate the validity of proposed method.

The speedup versus the number of particles  Fig. 12 shown the DRR comparison between proposed method and PPSO, is also designed to validate the significant contributions of proposed method  The results appeared in Fig. 11 show that an efficient critical point around CC = 0.7 can be reached to obtain a high quality DRR along with a lower VCA impact. In the proposed parallel PPSO, the speedup almost proportional to amount of the number of particles with two sets of image data as shown in Fig. 13. The more particles the better the speedups. This result can well demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PSO process IV C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we propose the PSO/WVIF framework for feature extraction of hyperspectral imagery. Firstly, the PSO band selection algorithm can grouped highly correlated bands of hyperspectral imagery into the some modules to coarsely reduce high-dimensional datasets.  Secondly, these highly correlated band modules can then be statistically analyzed among bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the most important feature bands form the datasets. In order to speed up the proposed processes, a parallel PSO algorithm based on modern GPU\ecture using NVIDIA CUDA technology is implemented in this paper to improve the computational speed of PSO band selection to group the high correlated band modules. The effectiveness of the proposed PSO/WVIF framework is evaluated by MASTER and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method not only could reduction the dimension of datasets, but also can offer a satisfactory classification performance and computational speed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the National Science Council Taiwan, under Grant No. NSC-102-2116-M-027-003   R EFERENCES   K.

We can also see that our approach has achieved a rate of rejection in some cases with sharing of resources smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros approach in the case without sharing For example with the rst input ow regular ow and with 50 MVs Calheiros approach has rejected more than 36 of requests received in the case without sharing while our rejected rate is less than 36 in the case of sharing with 5 MVs affected Also with the second ow and 50 MVs Calheiros has rejected in the case without sharing more than 30.5 of received requests while our rate of rejection is less than of 30.5 in the case of sharing and with 5 MVs affected The same gain is more visible with the results of 100 MVs where we can see that the rejection rate of our approach in the case of sharing and with 40 MVs affected 0.1 with the regular ow and 0.2 with the random ow is smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros in the case without sharing 4 with the regular ow and 1 with the random ow Fig 5 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 50 VMs Fig 6 Average response time regular ow with 50 VMs By cons where the vast majority of virtual machines are affected by degradation the Calheiros strategy proved more effective however such cases must be very rare with the use of placement policies of virtual machines in the Clouds V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed a new load balancing policy that takes into account the interference of performance which may affect the QoS of virtual machines in the Clouds Our proposal was more scalable and could signicantly reduce the rate of rejected requests in both cases with and without resource sharing We have shown that it is possible to reduce the rate of rejected requests through optimal use of capacities of virtual machines and we were able to mitigate the degradations of some virtual machines using other non-affected virtual machines without creating an additional burden However we intend to complete this work by the introduction of a policy to predict the evolution of the intensity of ow of requests to dynamically obtain the appropriate number of instances to create or maintain to meet the desired QoS Fig 7 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 100 VMs Fig 8 Average response time regular ow with 100 VMs
