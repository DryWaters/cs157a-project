two-dimensional sparse data publication, so as to boost the accuracy of range queries of the released data. The proposed approach in this paper includes two steps: 1\ getting the sampling set of the original two-dimensional sparse dataset by adopting filter sampling algorithm; 2\uilding an incomplete quadtree based on the sampling dataset and adjusting the tree nodesê noise values under consistency. Experimental analysis is designed by comparing the proposed algorithm and the traditional algorithms on the accuracy of range queries in the released data Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible I

 I NTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of information technology various organizations can gather vast amount of personal information easily, such as hospitals, online social networks etc. Analysis on such data may find valuable information while endanger the privacy of the individuals who contribute to the data. Privacy preserving becomes an increasingly serious issue. The purpose of  privacy protection research is to provide adequate privacy guarantees and enhance the utility of the released data Traditionally, there are three famous privacy preserving models, including anonymity   diversity 
 and 
t 
closeness 3 Though these models can preserve privacy in some situations, they are vulnerable to suffer attacks by the adversary who has specific background knowledge  To overcome these shortages, Dwork proposed a new privacy model called  Differential Privacy 5 which can protect against the adversary with arbitrary auxiliary information. Differential privacy has emerged as a strong and widely accepted privacy model. The privacy safety of differential privacy is guaranteed by injecting a small random noise into query answer In general, the data owner could offer only a limited 
magnitude of quite accurate answers with differential privacy model. Every query needs a low privacy budget, when the numbers of queries grow, the privacy budget is exhausted. The non-interactive mechanism publishes a çsanitizedé version of the collected data, so it can solve the problem of query numbers In this paper, we study two-dimensional sparse datasets of non-interactive mechanism of differential privacy. Such as the geo-spatial data, this type of data is very sparse and important This paper aims to balance the requirements of utility and achieve sufficient privacy guarantees. First, we adopt a filter algorithm to get a sampling dataset, in order to compress the dataset. Second, we build an incomplete quadtree over the sampling dataset. It is no longer to divide the area that if no 
node in the sampling dataset. After injecting noise data to the tree nodes, we exploit unbiased estimation algorithm to adjust the inconsistency of parent and children nodes II 
 
R ELATED W ORK  Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise to the real results and returned to the user, the noise is based on a random variable with a zero mean, like Laplace mechanisms 6  Geometric mechanism  etc In this section, we present a brief summary of the data publication of differential privacy. Dwork 5 raised the basic method by adding a random noise data to every data, while 
with wide range of query will cause the noise accumulation Xiao  proposed an algorithm using wavelet transforms called Privelet. Privelet first conducts a wavelet tree on the original data and then adds polylogarithmic noise to the tree nodes Xu 9 generated two methods, NoiseFirst and StructureFirst Ace  developed two algorithms based on Fourier transform and the other two methods similar to 9 Hay 1 pointed out consistency constraints, as a post-processing technique, is able to boost the accuracy of histogram queries. Xiao  first 
generated a synthetic histogram by adding noise to each cell histogram, and then build a kd-tree based space partitioning strategy for releasing a v-optimal histogram. Graham 1  studied spatial data, and proposed structure a quadtree or a kdtree over the input data, after adding noise to the tree, return the result by arithmetic method Sparse data is one of the real data. It has characteristic of sparse, so this type of data needs more strict privacy protection and higher requirements of utility. In this case, Graham 1  proposed a framework to summary the sparse data.

While based on the context of sparse data, F-BCQT algorithm works better than only used BLUE algorithm.  Besides compare Fig.3\(a\ith Fig.3\(b\, the error of the three algorithms all get increase when the range size of query get larger. Therefore, larger  range lead to more noise accumulated  Fig. 4 The error is larger than Fig.3. Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise.  The added noise affect the utility of publishing data. So the more smaller,  the  greater the noise. The experimental results proved the theory  Fig. 5 C ONCLUSIONS  Differential privacy is a robust privacy protection mechanism that can against the attack of background knowledge. We have propose a general framework of a twostep process the 2-dimension sparse data. First, by a filter algorithm to get the sample dataset, the purpose is to disrupt the original location of non-zero data. Second, we construct the incomplete quadtree depend on the sampling dataset. The data has compressed after this step. Then, we use unbiased estimation algorithm to adjust the tree nodes to satisfy the consistency constraints. Verified by experiment, we have improve the utility of sparse data. In order to reduce the noise added to sparse data, how to compress the sparse data is the future work R EFERENCES  1  
The population distribution of USA with 0.1  Fig.4 shows the error of privacy parameter 0.1 The synthetic dataset with 1   Fig. 6 The synthetic dataset with 0.1  The result of synthetic dataset is similar  to USA population Although the size of synthetic data is only half of the real data the error is not half. Construction of incomplete quadtree depends on data. Discrete data will lead quadtree node add more noise. The synthetic data is more discrete, The results are also verified this In summary, our experiments demonstrate that F-BCQT algorithm has a better data utility on sparse data than Boost-4 and BLUE-4, which is consistent as our theory VI Sweeney L. k-Anonymity: A Model for Protecting Privacy.[J  International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems. 2002, 10 000\003 2 Machanavajjhala A, Kifer D, Gehrke J, Venkitasubramaniam M. ldiversity: Privacy beyond k-anonymity[J A C M T r ans a ct io ns o n  Knowledge Discovery from Data \(TKDD\ 2007, 1\(1\: 3 000\003 3 Li N, Li T, Venkatasubramanian S. t-closeness: Privacy beyond kanonymity and l-diversity[C  I n Da t a  E n gin eeri n g  20 07 I C DE 2 00 7 IEEE 23rd International Conference on.IEEE, 2007. 106-115 000\003 4 Martin D J, Kifer D, Machanavajjhala A, Gehrke J, Halpern J Y.
