Abstract 
As an important kind of NOSQL databases, graph database management systems \(GDBMSs\ave improved greatly in recent years. However, the development of related linked queries is still limited. This paper introduces an approach for matching frequently-used management tasks of GDBMS with concepts in Structured Query Language \(SQL An application programming interface \(API\ based on the Neo4j GDBMS was developed to enable functionalities needed with graph databases. Besides the API, a user-friendly graphical user interface \(GUI\ was developed enabling the management and demonstration of graph datasets Further is proposed as a design for integrating graphs with tables. The prototype combining these components constitutes the fundamental elements of a graph

databases only provide functions for developers. Neo4j does provide Cypher, but its query functionalities are limited. For example, some typical data manipulation operations, such as insert and update, are not provided in Cypher. The relational and SQL data world has an engrained expectation for a standardized command structure allowing easy manipulation of values with the data representation Query Categories Query Functions Descriptions 
NOSQL databases could benefit from the inclusion of standard SQL operations The conceptualization of such a combination of SQL terms with graph databases [6, 7  is  expressed in Table I. In the table, the behavior to be expressed by the command is indicated.  At this time, the implementation of the functionality is pending TABLE I Q UERY D ESGIN OF P ROPOSED API

The GDBMSs employ physical adjacency while RDBMSs employ synthetic adjacency, inferring a relationship due to the key-field for instance Subsequent steps of the project explore incorporating join-operations between relational data and graph data Extending graph data into the data warehouse paradigm a new developed.

we monitored the ensemble accuracy Acc   and the mean accuracy of individual models of the ensemble    Acc  m i   on testing and validation datasets The experimental results section is divided into thee subsections Firstly the effect of Rt on Acc   then comparison of the accuracy of the three partitioning methods and nally statistical analysis section A The effect of Rt on Acc  Fig 3 Adult dataset experimental results accuracy of ensemble the mean accuracy of individual models within the ensemble on validation and testing datasets against the size of subset 1 Result of Adult dataset  Relationship between Acc  and Rt On the adult dataset the highest Acc  was achieved in the three partitioning methods when a small Rt was used as a size for the subsets Figure 3 shows the Acc  on testing and validation datasets for adult dataset when the three partitioning methods were used The left chart in Figure 3 illustrates the result when the sequential non-overlapping partitioning was used and it shows that the Acc  on the testing dataset fell from 84.82 to 82.77 when the subset size was increased from 4 to 48 respectively In the same manner the middle graph and the right shows that the Acc  decreased when the subset size increased and round robin partitioning and sampling without replacement were used respectively  Relationship between Acc  and  Acc  m i  Another important result that can be observed from Figure 3 is that the Acc  achieved better performance than the mean of the accuracy of individual models of the ensemble   Acc  m i   in all the examined cases Fig 4 Web dataset experimental results accuracy of ensemble the mean accuracy of individual models within the ensemble on validation and testing datasets against the size of subset 2 Results of web dataset  Relationship between Acc  and Rt The effect of the size of subset on Acc  in the web dataset was completely different from its effect on the adult dataset Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between Acc  and Rt for the three used partitioning strategies When round robin and sampling without replacement were used the Acc  had a proportional relationship to Rt The only difference between the behaviour of the two partitioning methods on this dataset is that in round robin partitioning the Acc  increased as a result of increasing Rt up to Rt  34  Then after that point Rt  34 the Acc  became steady and no improvement was achieved by the growth of Rt When sampling without replacement was used the Acc  continued to increase by the increase of Rt The big difference occurred when the sequential nonoverlapping partitioning was used which shows that Acc  was not affect by Rt at all and that the Acc  was steady when the value of Rt varied from 4 to 48  Relationship between Acc  and  Acc  m i  Figure 4 also shows that when round robin and sampling without replacement were used the Acc  achieves still better performance than the mean of the accuracy of individual models   Acc  m i   While in sequential non-overlapping partitioning although the Acc  was steady and did not improve during the experiment the   Acc  m i   has a direct relationship to Rt and   Acc  m i   where  Acc  m i   95.47 when Rt 4 up to 97.62 when Rt=48 In addition the   Acc  m i   achieved better performance than the Acc  between Rt  21 and Rt=48 Fig 5 IJCNN dataset experimental results accuracy of ensemble the mean accuracy of individual models within the ensemble on validation and testing datasets against the size of subset 3 Results of IJCNN dataset  Relationship between Acc  and Rt Figure 5 shows that when the sequential nonoverlapping partitioning was used the Acc  on the testing dataset increased from 94 to 98 when Rt also increased from 4 to 48 When round robin partitioning was used Acc  on testing and validation datasets varied up and down with no obvious pattern or trend starting from Rt  4 up to 34 after 34 the Acc  become steady and was not affected by the Rt whatever its size When sampling without replacement was applied there was an improvement to Acc  on validation and testing datasets by increasing of Rt as illustrated by the right chart in Figure 5  Relationship between Acc  and  Acc  m i  46 


By focusing on the relationship between Acc  and mean of the accuracy of individual models    Acc  m i   Figure 8 shows that our ensemble performs better than   Acc  m i   on the sequential nonoverlapping and sampling methods When round robin was used the Acc  achieved nearly similar performance to   Acc  m i   in almost all cases except between Rt  21 and 34 where   Acc  m i   showed better performance than Acc   Fig 6 Cover type dataset experimental results accuracy of ensemble the mean accuracy of individual models within the ensemble on validation and testing datasets against the size of subset 4 Results of Cover type dataset  Relationship between Acc  and Rt The relationship between Acc  and Rt for this dataset is very similar to the relationship between Acc  and Rt on adult dataset The highest Acc  was achieved when a small Rt was used Figure 6 shows the Acc  on testing datasets fell dramatically from 78.86 to 62.94 when Rt varied from 4 to 48 when the sequential non-overlapping partitioning was used The same relationship pattern appears when round robin partitioning and sampling without replacement were used  Relationship between Acc  and  Acc  m i  Figure 6 also illustrates that Acc  achieves better performance than the mean of the accuracy of individual models   Acc  m i   in all the examined cases in the three partitioning strategies Fig 7 KDDCUP-99 intrusion dataset experimental results accuracy of ensemble the mean accuracy of individual models within the ensemble on validation and testing datasets against the size of subset 5 Results of KDDCUP-99 intrusion dataset  Relationship between Acc  and Rt In this dataset the Acc  for the testing and validation dataset in all three partitioning strategies has not been affected by the relative size of the subset Rt The Acc  was steady during the whole experiment as Figure 7 shows  Relationship between Acc  and  Acc  m i  Figure 7 also illustrates that Acc  achieved better performance than the mean of the accuracy of individual models   Acc  m i   in all the examined cases in which the round robin and sampling without replacement were used While sequential nonoverlapping partitioning was used on testing and validation datasets the Acc  achieved better performance than  Acc  m i  from Rt=4 up to Rt=40 The  Acc  m i  achieved better performance from Rt=42 than the Acc   B Comparing the accuracy of the three partitioning methods 1 Adult dataset Figure 8 shows that the sequential nonoverlapping partitioning and round robin partitioning yield similar pattern on the testing dataset while sampling without replacement achieves lowest accuracy compared to the previous two partitioning strategies 2 Web dataset By comparing the performance of the three partitioning methods depending on testing accuracy it is clear from Figure 8 that round robin and sampling without replacement have very similar performance whereas the sequential non-overlapping partitioning yields lowest performance and has no effect on accuracy of ensemble on the test data 3 IJCNN dataset Figure 8 shows that the round robin partitioning achieved the worst accuracy in general compared to the other two strategies Sampling without replacement achieved better accuracy in most cases 4 Cover type dataset By comparing the accuracy of the three partitioning methods depending on testing accuracy it is clear from Figure 8 that the sequential non-overlapping partitioning and sampling without replacement have very similar accuracy while the round robin partitioning achieves the lowest accuracy when a small subset size is used and the highest accuracy when large subsets are used compared to the other two partitioning strategies 5 KDDCUP-99 intrusion dataset By comparing the accuracy of the three partitioning methods depending on testing accuracy it is clear from Figure 8 that round robin and sampling without replacement have very similar accuracy and much better accuracy than that achieved by the sequential nonoverlapping partitioning C Statistical analysis We statistically evaluated our ensembles using two nonparametric approaches the McNemars and Friedman tests 1 McNemarês Test McNemars test is suitable to test two classiìers on a single domain In this set of experiments McNemars test was used to determine if the classiìcation errors of two ensembles with different Rt are statistically different For all datasets and for each partition  we compared the ensemble created from the smallest Rt of 4 denoted by ensemble4 and the largest Rt of 48 denoted by ensmble48 In most of the 15 examined cases the results of McNemars test provide strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis with 47 


Fig 8 Compare the effect of different partitioning methods on Adult,Web,IJCNN Cover Type and KDDCUP-99 datasets a P value less than 0.0005 which means that the ensemble created from the training datasets with Rt  4 is signiìcantly different than the ensemble created from the training datasets with Rt  48 Four cases did not present enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis the Web dataset when the sequential nonoverlapping partitioning was used and in the intrusion dataset when all the three partitioning methods were used 2 Friedman Test The Friedman test can be used to evaluate multiple classiìers for multiple datasets In this set of experiments the Friedman test was used to determine if the three partitioning strategies used in this experiment are statically different The results show that there is not a statistical difference in the performance of the three partitioning methods on the ve datasets with p=0.819 VI D ISCUSSION Our results conìrm that subset size affects the ensemble accuracy Acc  in different ways which can be roughly classiìed into three groups of patterns as shown in Figure9 In P1 Acc  decreased when increasing the subset size Rt In P2 the Acc  increases with the growth of Rt In P3 the Acc  does not improve or decrease with the increase of Rt Fig 9 Possible conceptual relationship patterns between Acc  and Rt Figure 10 show the true relationship patterns between the relative subset size Rt and Acc  in the three partitioning Fig 10 Relationship patterns between Acc  and Rt which were observed in our experiments strategies examined in this experiment for all the used datasets It is clear from Figure 10 that the relationship between Rt and Acc  in Adult and Cover type datasets is similar to pattern P1 while in web and IJCNN datasets their relationship is similar to pattern P2 and the relationship in the intrusion dataset is similar to P3 In this experiment we intended to nd out possible relation between the pattern group and dataset It seems that the number of instances and number of attributes are not the only factors that determine the relationship pattern Adult and Cover types belong to the same pattern while they are very different in terms of number of instances and number of attributes Also Web and IJCNN belong to the same pattern although they have a similar number of instances but a huge difference between their numbers of attributes For these reasons there is a need for further investigation to nd how to determine the pattern of the relationship and how to nd the suitable subset size In addition our results show that sampling without replacement and round robin partitioning achieves better accuracy in 80 of the examined datasets Table III shows the best partitioning strategy for each dataset depending on their Acc  on testing datasets TABLE III B EST P ARTITIONING S TRATEGIES FOR EACH DATASET  Dataset Best partitioning strategies Adult sequential non-overlapping and round robin Web round robin and sampling without replacement IJCNN01 round robin and sampling without replacement Cover type sequential sampling without replacement KDDCUP-99 round robin and sampling without replacement VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we explored the relationship between partitioning methods and Acc   For this task we examined three partitioning strategies sequential non-overlapping partitioning round robin partitioning and sampling without replacement Although sampling without replacement and round robin partitioning achieved better accuracy in 80 of the examined datasets as shown in Table III the results of the statistical test do not present enough evidence to conclude if there is a signiìcant difference in the performance of the three partitioning strategies on the ve examined datasets Nevertheless in practise sampling should be considered in the rst place if there is no speciìc knowledge about the other two We also investigated the relationship between the relative size of the subset Rt and the ensemble accuracy  Acc   We found that Rt can have effect on Acc   As illustrated in Figure 9 this effect can be represented by one of three 48 


relationship patterns between Rt and Acc   Our results show that the well accepted idea that having more training data instances generally leads to the best classiìcation performance is not always true as the best accuracy for in Adult and Cover Type datasets were achieved by having small subset sizes The relationship patterns of a dataset cannot be detected by the number of its instances and attributes because it is found they are not the only factors that affect the behaviour of the relationship between Acc  and Rt for a dataset Further study should include more investigation to discover the relationship type between ensemble accuracy  Acc   and the relative size of a subset Rt as the number of instances and number of attributes do not provide an interpretation for this relationship For that reason it is necessary to repeat the experiment on larger datasets and apply some vertical petitioning techniques and conduct an in-depth and detailed analysis to nd out how to determine the best size of a subset and what type of partitioning strategies is suitable for a dataset R EFERENCES  S T otad R Geeta C Prasanna N Santhosh and P  Reddy  Scaling data mining algorithms to large and distributed datasets Intl J Database Manag Syst  vol 2 pp 26Ö35 2010  N Amano J o Gama and F  Silv a Exploiting parallelism in decision tree induction in Proceedings from the ECML/PKDD Workshop on Parallel and Distributed computing for Machine Learning  2003 pp 13Ö22  N K erdprasop and K K erdprasop Data partitioning for incremental data mining in The 1st International Forum on Information and Computer Science  Citeseer 2003 pp 114Ö118  I Tsang A K ocsor  and J Kw ok Di v ersiìed SVM ensembles for large data sets Machine Learning ECML 2006  pp 792Ö800 2006  T  Oates and D Jensen The ef fect of training set size on decision tree complexity in Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Machine Learning  1997 pp 254Ö262  Oates T i m and Jensen Da vid Lar ge datasets lead to o v erly comple x models an explanation and a solution in Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  1998 pp 294Ö298  L Hall N Cha wla K Bo wyer et al  Combining decision trees learned in parallel in Working Notes of the KDD-97 Workshop on Distributed Data Mining  1998 pp 10Ö15  D P atil and R Bichkar   An optimistic data mining approach for handling large data set using data partitioning techniques International Journal of Computer Applications  vol 24 no 3 pp 29Ö33 2011  J Basilico M Munson T  K olda K Dixon and W  K e gelme yer  COMET A recipe for learning and using ensembles on massive data Data Mining ICDM 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on  pp 41Ö50 2011  C Ranichandra and J V ijayashree Ef cient lik e commands for dynamic data retrieval and report generation from parallel databases Asian Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology  vol 2 no 04 2012  I Tsang J Kw ok and P  Cheung Core v ector machines F ast SVM training on very large data sets Journal of Machine Learning Research  vol 6 no 1 pp 363Ö392 2005  I Tsang A K ocsor  and J Kw ok Libcvm toolkit  http://c2inet.sce.ntu.edu.sg/ivor/cvm.html 2011 accessed 02/02/2012  I W  Tsang A K ocsor  and J T  Kw ok Simpler core v ector machines with enclosing balls in Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning  ser ICML 07 ACM 2007 pp 911Ö918  J Platt et al  Sequential minimal optimization A fast algorithm for training support vector machines 1998  C.-c Chang and C.-J Lin Ijcnn 2001 challenge Generalization ability and text decoding in Neural Networks 2001 Proceedings IJCNNê01 International Joint Conference on  vol 2 IEEE 2001 pp 1031Ö1036  T  G Dietterich  Approximate statistical tests for comparing supervised classiìcation learning algorithms Neural computation  vol 10 no 7 pp 1895Ö1923 1998  J Dem  sar Statistical comparisons of classiìers over multiple data sets The Journal of Machine Learning Research  vol 7 pp 1Ö30 2006 49 


tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justiìed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clariìed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and efìcient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using artiìcial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1Ö4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identiìcation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461Ö464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981Ö2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3Ö17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280Ö289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classiìcation  vol 14 pp 75Ö100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artiìcial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300Ö1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173Ö183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an inìnite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Artiìcial intelligence  2006 pp 381Ö388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240Ö265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719Ö725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453Ö461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89Ö98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
