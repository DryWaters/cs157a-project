Nazim Uddin Design Engineering Services Microchip Technology Inc Chandler, Arizona, USA nazim.uddin@smsc.com  Abstract 227Despite the booming of cloud computing, people will be using PCs for various good reasons including connecting to the cloud server. According to a 2009 report, more than two million people in every month have had their computer affected by malware, etc. although about 95% people use antivirus software Recent studies warn that two most terrifying facts regarding malware attacks are \(i\ttacks intensified by 68% in year 2011 than in year 2010 and \(ii\ targets shifted towards end-point systems. However, 'there is no legal solution to malware Current software-based solution \(like anti-virus software\ to secure a system from malware attacks or restore a system after attacks is expensive and becomes obsolete very quickly Contemporary state-of-the-art hardware security modules HSMs\ot adequate to protect and restore end-user\222s computer systems from malware attacks in a hassle-free costeffective way. In this work, we propose an USB memory based solution to restore a full system including operating system \(OS application software, and data files, if needed due to malware attacks. Proposed easy- steps solution is suitable for most systems old or new\, most OSs \(Windows or Linux\ and all users \(novice or moderate or advanced level\. Based on our preliminary experience, we are convinced that the proposed system recovery solution is feasible. In fact, proposed user friendly solution has potential to save big money and reduce distress for most users   Keywords\227 221Decrypt\222 image disk, \221encrypt\222 primary disk hardware security module, restoring systems, malware attacks  I   I NTRODUCTION  According to a report published in the Telegraph \(in UK\ in May 2009, more than 12 million people had their computers affected in last 6 months by malware, virus, etc. The results came despite the fact that 95% people claimed that they used antivirus software   T h e da t a co l l e c t ed i n 2011  r e gard i ng malware and virus attacks is frightening. Recent statistics reveal that \(i\alware attacks increased by 68% in 2011 when compared to that in 2010, \(ii\ small organizations were targeted with denial of service \(DoS\ and distributed denial of service DDoS\ attacks, and \(iii\ more attackers are aimed to end-users and end-systems [2       A computer program or a segment of code that manipulate user information in a destructive manner without the authorization of the user is generally defined as a computer virus or malicious software \(malware\s the computer usages are increasing, the \(software and\ malware development is also surging [4 A l t ho ugh so m e m o d e r n vi r use s a r e  p r e ve nt a bl e by using antivirus software, viruses such as Boot sector Multipartite, Worms, Polymorphic, Rootkits, Metamorphic and Memory resident virus often cannot be traced by signature scanning or code scanning. Due to attacks of these viruses, the system may need a full restore that includes formatting the hard drive, reinstalling the OS, downloading/reinstalling drivers downloading/reinstalling update/patch files, and reinstalling application software  Even though some OSs provide the system restore functionality, in an event where boot sector or the entire partition is affected \(by Rootkits, Multipartite, etc.\, system restore may not work [6-8 v e r a g e user s ar e no t er udi t e  enough to handle such intricate issues. As a consequence they have to pay a good amount of money for those services. In order to manage a steadfast computer system without extra cost and training, we propose an inexpensive plug-n-play hardware security module \(HSM\ based solution  HSMs are also known as hardware cryptographic device and cryptographic module. In general, HSM is defined as a piece of hardware and associated software/firmware that usually attaches to a PC \(or server\and provides at least the minimum of cryptographic functions including encryption and decryption. The physical device \(i.e., HSM\ has a user interface and a programmable interface [9   In th is w o rk w e in tro d u ce  an USB memory \(to hold a light version of customized OS based HSM solution to restore computer systems from malware attacks in an expensive and easy way  This paper is organized as follows.

II  S URVEY  A few selected published articles closely related to hardware security modules and malware attacks are discussed in this section  A summary of computer threats faced in 2011 monitored by Europe based Redscan on its customers in Europe and Worldwide is discussed in I n 20 11  Red s c a n N e t w o r k Bo x Security Response issued more than 8 signatures per second that is 26% more than the previous year\. As shown in Table I hacktivist attacks are more \(and growing\; 56% of the total attacks in 2011. This report also reveals that hackers are targeting more small businesses and end-users with denial of service \(DoS\ and distributed DoS using malware T ABLE I  A TTACKS IN Y EAR 2011 Type of Attack Percentage Hacktivist attacks using malware, etc 56 ICS and SCADA vulnerabilities 17 Mobile device attacks 11 Network breaches 11 SSL vulnerabilities 5  Malware was considered more of a proof of concept software program than a tool to be used for data theft until the early 1990s. The situation has changed dramatically in the last two decades. Using malware is a natural evolution for cyberattacks. Among all kind of malwares, memory parser malware led the way, accounting for 45% of all investigated by SpiderLabs in 2010 [3 As p o i n t o f-sa l e P O S  sy st e m s a r e widely used for convenience and very vulnerable, criminals use them to obtain the data necessary to commit payment card fraud. New malware found in 2010 was a POS applicationspecific malware  Much of what is call \221convenience\222 \(even though the consequences may be very inconvenient\ is a considerable part of the reason malware is so widespread in this world Unfortunately, 'there is no legal solution to malware' [10   Therefore, computer users need to be careful about what they are doing. Also, there should be inexpensive and easy solutions for average users to recovery their systems, when needed  Most common practice to recover an infected PC include the following steps: \(i\ogon in safe mode \226 Microsoft's Safe Mode loads only the minimum required programs and services ii\ delete temporary files \226 doing this may speed up the virus scanning and even get rid of some malware, and \(iii\ run antivirus software like Malwarebytes \226 examine any detected suspect files, and remove any suspect files [11  In s o m e cas es  when the malware cannot be removed or the PC does not function properly, useful documents are copied to external disk\(s\before re-installing the OS. In the worst case, the PC i.e., OS\ cannot be turned on properly. The only solution to this problem is reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the OS, which is time-consuming, troublesome, and can be expensive. Reformatting hard drive and reinstalling OS expect administrator level skill and required software  In this work, we propose a HSM based cool and cheap solution for full system recovery \(including OS, application software, and data files\, if needed due to malware attacks III  H ARDWARE S ECURITY M ODULE  A hardware security module is a piece of hardware and associated software/firmware that are usually attached to a PC or server and provides at least the minimum of cryptographic functions \(like encryption and decryption\. It is helpful to have the basic knowledge of HSM to understand our proposed approach. Therefore, we briefly discuss HSM functions usages, and some drawbacks in this section A  HSM Functions An HSM provides accelerated cryptographic operations such as encryption, digital signatures, and hashing. We use encryption technique in our solution. In cryptography encryption is a process of obscuring information so that it cannot be read without a \221special key\222. This is typically done for secrecy. We use encryption for security and compression  B  Usages of HSM An HSM has a number of different uses. Generally HSMs are implemented for the following usages  200  To securely encrypt sensitive data for storage in a relatively non-secure location such as a database 200  To aid in authentication by verifying digital signatures 200  To generate secure key for smartcard production  C  Pitfalls of HSM The biggest drawbacks to using an HSM are associated to cost, user friendliness, and upgrading. The price can range from under a thousand dollars each to many thousands depending on the level of required functionality and security HSM vendors typically withhold a lot of information about how their security products work. Between HSMs and software, HSMs are difficult to upgrade IV  P ROPOSED S YSTEM R ECOVERY A PPROACH  Instead of traditional Tom-and-Jerry type solutions \(virus anti-virus software, new/improved virus, new/improved antivirus software, so on and so forth\, we propose a hardware security module based solution to re-establish \(and thus protect\ computer systems from malware attacks. Required functionalities \(modified light OS and software\e built and loaded into an USB memory \(hardware A  Proposed System Architecture According to the proposed hardware/software based HSM solution, the computer system requires two discrete hard disks 


and one USB memory. When security is concerned, the presence of two physical hard disks in a system has a greater advantage over the logical partitions. Logical partitions can be affected with viruses even though the user does not access it Schematic in Figure 1 illustrates our proposed system architecture. Here, one disk \(usually the internal disk\d act as the Primary Drive and the other one \(external or internal as a Backup Drive. The bootable \221Hot USB Memory\222 contains special software. The functionalities of the proposed failsafe solution are controlled by the specially developed software loaded into the USB memory. This software is the updated edition of an open-source light-version Linux OS; it is carefully designed to perform the \221Encrypt\222 \(discussed later\and 221Decrypt\222 \(discussed later\ commands  Fig. 1 Proposed system architecture B  Key Functionalities There are three key functionalities of the proposed approach; they are: \(i\ncrypt\222, \(ii\ \221Decrypt\222, and \(iii\ Close as shown in Figure 2. \221Encrypt\222 refers to the process of creating a bootable image of an existing clean system including OS application software, and selected data files \(from the Primary Drive\ and store it in a Backup Drive. \221Decrypt\222 refers to the process of reinstating a clean system to the Primary Drive from the previously generated/saved image in the Backup Drive. The program can be terminated, if needed, at any time by using the Close option C  Proposed Workflow The USB memory should have the highest boot priority i.e., if the system is started or re-started when USB memory is connected, it should start from the USB memory\The workflow of the proposed system recovery solution is presented in Figure 2. To \221Encrypt\222 a clean \(not infected by malware\ystem, user should make sure that the backup disk is physically connected \(if external\ and enabled so that the basic input/output system \(BIOS\ recognizes it. Then, \221Encrypt\222 function formats it; create image from the primary disk and write it directly to the backup disk, simultaneously. Once create/write image is completed, it is important that the user shut down the system completely, disconnect the backup disk\(s\and USB memory, and re-start the system. System should normally start from the Primary Drive. It should be noted that user may create multiple backup images on multiple backup disks If the system \(i.e., Primary Drive\ is infected by malware/virus and anti-virus software fails to fix it, \221Decrypt\222 process should be used to rebuild a clean system without losing any important applications and data files. At the beginning of the \221Decrypt\222 process, user can scan any files/folders from the primary disk and store them \(into the USB memory\  Then 221Decrypt\222 function formats the primary disk and reinstates a clean system from the backup disk to the primary disk. After that, user may copy files/folders, as appropriate, from the USB memory to the primary disk. Finally, user should shut down the system completely, disconnect the backup disk and USB memory, and re-start the system. Again, system should normally start from the Primary Drive  Fig. 2 Proposed functionalities and  workflow V  E VALUATION  As a preliminary effort, we develop the initial version of the software using open-source Xubuntu \(Lightweight Ubuntu Linux d t e s t i t  u s i ng In t e l i 386 pers on al co m p u t e rs  with Windows 7 and Linux Fedora 14 OSs. In the following subsections, we briefly discuss assumptions, hardware and software used, and important observations A  Assumptions Important assumptions include the following 


200  The USB drive has the highest boot priority. So, if the PC is started when USB memory is connected, the system should start from the USB memory B  Hardware and Software Requirement We use one 40 Gigabyte hard disk and one 4 Gigabyte USB memory in our experiment. These numbers may vary depending on the OS, application software, and data files  C  Important Observations We conduct our experiment using two Intel i386 PCs \(one for Windows and one for Linux\ our test, we successfully 221Encrypt\222 and \221Decrypt\222 both Windows 7 and Linux Fedora 14 OSs. After the completion of \221Encrypt\222 and \221Decrypt\222 processes, newly reinstated system works normally. Based on our preliminary experience, we are convinced that the proposed solution is capable of carrying on the system recovery functionalities in case of severe malware attacks  We summarize our observations by comparing the proposed approach with traditional anti-virus solutions in Table II. Our proposed approach will require a USB memory which should cost less than USD 10. However, traditional anti-virus software may cost more than USD 100. Chances of data lost are extremely high in traditional anti-virus solution if it fails to protect the system. There is zero or very low chances to loose data using the proposed solution  T ABLE II  C OMPARISON OF T RADITIONAL S OLUTIONS WITH P ROPOSED A PPROACH  Consideration A Traditional Anti-Virus Solution Proposed Approach Cost Expensive Cheap Chances of Data Loss High Zero or very Low Usability Difficult Easy Suffering Very High Very Low Hardware/Software Requirement High \(OS CD/DVD applications, etc Low \(only the Hot USB memory Skill Level Required Advenced Any \(novice-moderateadvanced Target PC Systems Mainly\w Any \(old-new Target Operating System Types Specific to Windows or others Any \(Windows-Linux Target Operating System Versions Mainly\ New Any \(old-new Target Users Mainly\ Enterprise Mainly\ individuals with older PCs and OSs  Considering expense, data recovery, user friendliness, target PC and OS systems, target users, computer skill required, etc our proposed solution is a better choice VI  S IGNIFICANCE OF THIS W ORK  As cloud computing is expected to grow \(when people will rent resources, software, and applications\, the usages of PCs and other computing devices are also supposed to increase Each user will need a PC/system to connect to the cloud server According to recent reports, the number of malware attacks will increase and infect more end-user systems  The only obvious solution to the problem when a system cannot be started after a malware attack is reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the OS. Needless to point out that this is not a happy solution. It is associated with multiple painful considerations like \(i\ cost for OS and applications, \(ii\hances of data loss, \(iii\installing required updates and third-party software, and \(iv\ental stress  Considering thousands to millions of malware attacks every day and average users\222 low computer skill, we strongly believe that proposed cheap \(almost free\d easy system recovery solution has enormous potential to make millions of people happy by relieving their agony and saving millions of dollars We also believe that this solution should offer a strong rally against cyber criminals VII  C ONCLUSIONS  Recent studies scarily indicate that malware and virus attacks are drastically growing and targeting more end-user systems. Certain malware and viruses will disrupt, even may destroy, the computer system regardless of the presence of antivirus software and/or the system restore program. In order to overcome this situation in an easy and inexpensive way, we propose a simple but effective solution to restore computing systems if needed. For an ordinary system, all it needs is one extra\ 40-GB hard disk and one 4-GB USB memory \(loaded with proposed solution software\. We develop and experiment the initial version of proposed solution in our laboratory According to the experimental results, we are confident to state that the proposed cheap and cool solution is capable of recovering systems from malware/virus attacks in a sophisticated way by saving significant amount of money and frustration  It should be noted that the proposed solution is not a replacement of the current anti-virus software solution However, proposed solution provides an easy way to recover an infected system. Thus, this USB memory based solution gives average users more confidence to use computers at any time. Considering price, usability, and effectiveness, our proposed solution is affordable for most users \(especially for the individuals with older PCs and OSs  We plan to investigate power-aware core allocation strategy for multicore architecture in our next endeavor 200  It is assumed that one extra hard disk \(for the Backup Drive\ is available to implement the proposed system recovery solution  200  It should be noted that the solution software should be available via an USB memory. No extra USM memory is needed
