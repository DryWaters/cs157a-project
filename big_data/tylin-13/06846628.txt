Abstract 
and management. At the same time, the world is in the age of the Big Data revolution which holds the potential to mitigate the effects of disaster events by enabling access to critical real time information. Thus, in this paper an integrated framework for analyzing disaster events by using the Big Data analytics is proposed.  The proposed framework shall address three key components to perform data organization, data integration and analysis, information presentation to users by utilizing Big Data with respect to disaster events. In doing so, the paper shall create a disaster domain-specific search engine using co-occurring theory and Markov chain concepts for preparing impacts of disaster attacks to make the society better aware of the 
situations. Specifically, stochastic clustering with constraints is used to automatically extract disaster events by defining the set of structural attributes. Some illustrative simulations are shown by using Big Data sources for the Great East Japan earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster events of 2011

 I NTRODUCTION  Natural or man-made disasters have caused a huge impact in the world`s economic and social systems which result in death or injury to humans, and damage or loss of properties such as building, communication systems, natural resources etc. Natural disasters come without warning taking lives of 
I 
tens, hundreds and thousands of people. In such cases, the use of timely, accurate and effective disaster information in disaster management and preparation scenarios has been extensively discussed in literature [1-3 erall y t h e d a ta  resources include news/articles/blogs from web, social networks platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and multimedia data like images and videos. The amount of data being gathered and stored is growing at a phenomenal rate in volume, velocity, and variety which can be referred to as Big Data. Since the combined characteristics of those data are based on \(i\ data producer and consumer concepts, \(ii\ime and space sensitivity of the exchanged information, \(iii\he level of reliabilities of the information sources, \(iv 
unstructured, and \(v\various formats, it is challenging as well as creating opportunities for extracting insight information about the disaster events through the Big Data analytics [4-6 In this context, studying human and event behaviors become an important factor of Big Data environments. In addition, the timely prediction of weather patterns and likelihood of hazard occurrences are also key interests of Big Data analytics. Big Data can also provide more real-time feedback information than ever before On the other hand, there are more traffic flows in communication high ways through social network platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and etc. during the time of disasters These communications are mainly about information seeking 
family and friends contacts in disaster zone. In such environments, Big Data can play a major role for seeking the insight information. Thus the aim of the paper is to explore the possibilities for the use of Big Data in the analyzing human behavior involved events in case of natural disasters and to propose an integrated framework for organizing insight information and data exchange between the participants in such events. The proposed method is based on the combination of Big Data concept and an emerging network science which is rooted in mathematics. Through the plotting of data on a network map, critical nodes known as hubs, can be identified for further study. Understanding a hub and its importance within a network provides 
information about the strength of the network, its interconnectedness, and the function of the network itself. In 000\002 
addition, the identification of less significant nodes and their quantity provides information on the scope of the network and its structural stability. Observing the nature of hubs and nodes in a network allows for an overall understanding of its function is illustrated in Fig. 1 The remaining parts of the paper are section wise organized. First some related research works are described in section 2. Section presents the proposed integrated framework for analyzing disaster events by using Big Data analytics approach. Some simulation results are shown in section 3 to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed 
method. Conclusions are drawn in section 4 II 
S OME R ELATED R ESEARCH W ORKS  In the existing literature, many research works concerning with simulation models for disaster response but only a few works in Big Data aspects. For example according t i t ha s no t i ce d  t ha t  t he t w e e t s d a t a abo ut  food price in Indonesia and the official statistics are very much related in similar patterns as seen in Fig. 2.

where stands for structure at time with reference to metric  When the structure, time and events are known, the data will be further organized into the second tube of specific domain, attributes, and response \(action\. In the second tube the domain dimension shall address the type of disaster such as man-made or natural. Whether it is large or small since the scale will influence on the modeling techniques. For example a terrorist attack may require methods for modeling the impact of explosion and suspicious people or objects behaviors. However, a tsunami and earthquake will require capabilities to model stranded victims and estimating social outcomes. The second dimension is organizing the interest of attributes. This dimension aims to minimize the impact of disaster event in the domain dimension. This will include living creature mainly human population, the impact of disaster on the infrastructure resources 
P ROPOSED I NTEGRATED F RAMEWORK  To be able use the massive volume of unstructured Big Data for disaster event analysis the proposed framework shall bring some order of the Big Data as shown in Fig. 3 The framework is composed of three conceptual cubes namely; \(i\ structure-metric- time cube, \(ii\domain-attributeresponse cube, \(iii\-node-analysis cube In the framework, the first tube is made up of three functional dimensions in which the structure dimension is to extract information about entities such as persons organizations, places, etc. and events natural disasters meetings, crowd behaviors etc. so that the structure of events can be further analyzed. The time dimension is to detect what actual calendar time the information is referred to when an event is described. For example, ç9:37 A.M, September 11, 2001é, ç3 P.M, March 11, 2011é. The function of metric dimension is for deciding the importance of received information. The metrics are numeric attributes of entities and events. For computational purpose, this cube will be represented by the random variable  
Network science example on disaster event analysis  Tweets about the price of rice Food Price Inflation  Figure 2 UN Global Pulseês project on food security trend graph  Generally, disaster event analysis requires methodologies for aggregation of the disaster-related data. Toward such a demand, the concept of Disaster Management Data space is established based on data acquisition, organization, and representation [8  A n oth e r ef f o rt to in v e stig a t e disas te r  event behavior is ontology-based approach [9 a nd knowledge-based approach by using social network platforms O n  t h e  o t h e r h a nd a l a r g e num b e r o f de c i s i on support systems have been developed for various types of disasters based on different models and decision support needs. A web-based decision support system for the response to strong earth-quakes is developed [1  T he sy st e m  w a s  focused on damage assessment and identification of effective response measures. An agent-based system for knowledge management and planning is developed for suggesting plans in emergency and disaster scenarios. Similar decision support systems have also been developed for hurricane emergencies [12, 13  a nd re s c ue  op er a t i o ns 14 Ho w e ve r  most of existing disaster event analysis systems failed since the data in disaster management application domains are collected and stored in various media types \(text, image video, graphics, etc.\ formats, and structures from multiple information sources in Big Data environments. Many of these data are streaming data and collected in real-time which may have temporal and spatial characteristics. These data may have different levels of completeness and confidence, and may be inconsistent. There is also information shift problem in these applications. That is, the information/knowledge may be constantly changed, outdated and incomplete. Moreover the data come from heterogeneous sources, having a mix of unstructured and structured types of different temporal and spatial characteristics, with various sources of uncertainty. To our best knowledge, there are no existing methodologies and/or algorithms that can properly address the current issues of disaster related event satisfactorily. Developing novel techniques for managing and analyzing data that are a mix of unstructured and structured types, of different temporal and spatial characteristics, with various sources of uncertainty, is a challenging task. In order to address the current issues of disaster related events, an integrated approach is proposed in this paper III

The overview of the proposed system The dimension of the controlling agents and their actions on the disaster events is also an important dimension in the second tube. It is necessary to model to understand the situations and scenarios. They themselves can become the disaster affected attributes. Since these three dimensions are equally important for disaster event analysis in Big Data aspect, three different random variables are used for representation of the cube. In particular, it will be represented by

for domain for attribute of interest and for types of response actions to be taken at time  The last tube of hub-node-analysis will perform the process of clustering the nodes or entities of interest defined in the previous two tubes. These clusters will be termed as hubs which will be focused for further analysis to obtain the insight situations of the disaster events. This can be described by a random variable   representing the outcome result of analysis over corresponding hubs and nodes involved Therefore, the proposed framework will lead to the study of 5-tuples   For simplicity denote the process by   1 forming a Markov chain with transition probabilities for vector type states to described as  1  where and are 5-tuples with scalar values. The corresponding transition matrix is given by     2 Then, the time dependent probability for    satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation of Markov chain as shown in \(3

  5 By using these probabilities, we can obtain the trends and behaviors of the associated disaster events Thus solving \(3\ recursively, one can obtain the information about the current situation for the disaster event IV S IMULATION R ESULTS  In this section, some simulations of the proposed method will be performed by using Japan earthquake and Tsunami events. An hour after the earth quake hit Japan on March 11 2011, the Big Data tracks 1200 tweets per minute. It also found that nine out of 10 tweets are trending topics -such as pray for japan, #tsunami and #japan - were directly related to the earthquake and tsunami. The corresponding state variables are shown in Table I 1 causes  2 meanwhile  2 causes and  causes 3\(\2\(\1 In order to investigate the trend patterns of the tsunami events, all possible combinations of 5-tuples defined in section 3 are formed as follows. In this scenario, there are 12 possible combinations all together They are described as follows

In particular, the top line shows the behavior of the combined event  standard crowd forming a queue  3 and actions taken by rescue workers  2 Similarly, the second top line shows the matching pattern for the event of combination of \(tsunami, a family floating and rescue\. But, the second bottom line shows the matching patterns of \(earthquake, family floating and crowd behavior analysis\ are not much directly related. The same is true for the last bottom line in the graph.

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round

The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
