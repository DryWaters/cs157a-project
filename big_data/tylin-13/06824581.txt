table which can reduce the network traf田 and guarantee the computation balance of the distributed system 
I I NTRODUCTION Big data has emerged as one of the most visible topics in technology today As with other trends such as mobile social and cloud computing big data represents both business opportunities and technical challenges Organizations of all types are extracting increased value from large data sets that come from real-time data streams video mobile Internet and many other sources However handling this data is not easy Big data must not only be stored it also be transmitted processed and reused by a variety of applications This means big data impacts everything in the entire IT stack including servers  computation middlew   and applications[6][8][7 One of the major challenges in big data processing is the 
computation of joins which have been studies in recent years    Although different joins are optimized by different methods cross join which is also called broadcast join as one kind of joins which returns the Cartesian product of rows from tables  is only support that one of the two tables is small enough to be stored in the memory At ZTE the application of recommendation system which has users more than tens of millions needs to calculate the similarity between users The storage of user information is close to 1T so it can not be stored in the memory It will lead to network traf田 if the computation is realized using the method Usually a big table is stored in the storage system using the form of sub-tables with the same size which is called 
in hadoop system The implementation of the cross join between two big tables 
block 
is to cross join each sub-table of the rst table with all subtables of the second table The method needs to duplicate all the sub-tables of the smaller table on each node which usually tends to cause a bottleneck of network traf田 In this paper we propose a sub-table distribution algorithm for distributed cross join which can reduce the network traf田 on the basis of the computation balance of the distributed system In the implementation of cross join we only copy a part of sub-tables of the two tables on each node just to meet the demand of the computation In the experiments we will show that the algorithm can reduce the network traf田 effectively for cross join of two big table The paper is organized as follows In the next section we introduce the data distribution model of cross join Next we 
present the algorithm of data distribution and the optimization in Section 3 We then continue with a presentation of the experiment of our algorithm in Section 4 and the conclusion in Section 5 II D ATA DISTRIBUTION M ODEL Assume there are two big tables of TableA and TableB with the sub-tables of and  respectively There is a cluster consists of same physical nodes with the number of  Without loss of generality we assume all the sub-tables have the same size and is not smaller than  Consider the cross join of TableA and TableB which

 Each node has NumTa NumNode TableA尽 sub-tables and NumTb TableB尽 sub-tables so the computing capacity of a node is  On the condition of not reduce each node尽 computing capacity we propose a new solution of sub-table distribution in the cluster We make the number of sub-tables of both tables on each node similar to

means that each sub-table of TableA need to cross join with all sub-tables of TableB In traditional solution the larger table尽 sub-tables are evenly in the cluster and the smaller table尽 sub-tables are duplicated on each node Then the network traf田 will be N umT a

with the increase of parallel clients. Every event index published in test is of the same size, and every event is relevant to 20 objects. In Mode 2, when DS accepts a publish request, it writes the information about this event index into several tables and then updates the OID index table. While in Mode 3, DS appends the event index to the rows of the concerned OIDs. Figure 10 shows the experiment results of parallel publishes. Tests under 200 and 400 parallel clients are only executed on Mode 3 for similar reason in Experiment 3. The maximum number of parallel publishes that Mode 2 can handle per second is less than 80 while the maximum number of parallel publishes that Mode 3 can handle is nearly 400  Figure 9  Comparison of parallel queries handled per second  Figure 10  Comparison of parallel publishes handled per second Experiment 1 to experiment 4 proved that both the ability to discover information from a big volume of DS records and the ability to handle concurrent requests of the proposed DS system are much better than DS based on RDBMS and its extra memory cost is acceptable V  C ONCLUSION  This paper works on improving the central-indexing DS which is faced with the challenge of massive data and large amount of parallel requests. The paper presents a new storage schema of DS data based on HBase. The new storage schema uses OID as row key, event time as column identifier, and event index as cell value to improve the discovery efficiency. A recursive discovery algorithm is specified to realize the full tracing of object which consists of both the events happened to the specific object and the events happened to its containers. The recursive discovery is included in the DS system as a service to reduce the client痴 workload. A prototype of the proposed DS system is implemented. A series of comparison experiments are conducted to prove the performance advantage of the proposed DS system in both efficiency and concurrency A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research activities as described in this paper were funded by national 863 high technology plan of China Grant No. 2011AA100701\ and the DNSLAB research project of China Internet Network Information Center R EFERENCES  1  EPCGlobal.

Another important issue is the positioning of cameras in the harbour It is well-known that the localization accuracy is strongly dependent on the distance from the vessels range but an intelligent displacement of cameras with their 002elds of view properly intersected to cover almost the same portion of the sea plane could increase the strength of the whole process A CKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Prof Carlo Regazzoni from Universit 264 a di Genova for very stimulating discussions on data fusion and for letting us use his precious class notes R EFERENCES  R Tsai 223A versatile camera calibration technique for high-accuracy 3d machine vision metrology using offthe-shelf tv cameras and lenses,\224 IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation vol 3 no 4 pp 323-344  August 1987  Z Zhang 223A 003exible new technique for camera calibration,\224 IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence vol 22 no 11 pp 1330-1334  November 2000  Technical characteristics for an automatic identi\002cation system using time-division multiple access in the VHF maritime mobile band  Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-4 April 2011  IALA Guideline No 1082 On an Overview of AIS  International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse June 2011  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea SOLAS  IMO May 2011  R Hartley and A Zisserman Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision 2ed  Cambridge 2003  E Trucco and A Verri Introductory Techniques for 3-D Computer Vision  Prentice Hall 1998  G Medioni and S B Kang Emerging Topics in Computer Vision  Prentice Hall 2004  223Marine traf\002c,\224 http://www.marinetraf\002c.com/ais 2012 B IOGRAPHY  Francesco A.N Palmieri received his Laurea in Ingegneria Elettronica from Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II Italy in 1980 In 1981 he served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Italian Army in full\002llment of draft duties In 1982 and 1983 he was with the ITT 002rms FACE SUD Selettronica in Salerno currently Alcatel Italy and Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company in Antwerpen Belgium as a designer of digital telephone systems In 1983 he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to conduct graduate studies at the University of Delaware USA where he received a Master's degree in Applied Sciences and a PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1985 and 1987 respectively He was appointed Assistant professor in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Connecticut Storrs USA in 1987 where he was awarded tenure and promotion to Associate Professor in 1993 In the same year he was awarded the position of Professore Associato at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni at Universit 264 a degli Studi di Napoli Federico II Italy where he has been until October 2000 when he became Professore Ordinario di Telecomunicazioni and moved to the Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione  Seconda Universit 264 a di Napoli Aversa Italy His research interests are in the areas of signal processing data fusion communications information theory and neural networks Francesco Castaldo received his Laurea in 2009 and his Laurea Magistrale in 2012 both in Ingegneria Informatica from Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli SUN He has cooperated during his thesis work with the PRISMA lab at Universit 264 a degli Studi di Napoli Federico II with prof B Siciliano and prof V Lippiello He is currently a postgraduate fellow with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione at SUN His research interests are in image processing computer vision and data fusion applied to robotics and home automation Guglielmo Marino received his Laurea in Ingegneria Elettronica at Seconda Univerit 264 a degli Studi di Napoli SUN in December 2012 His 002nal thesis project has been on data fusion of digital images with AIS data in harbor management 8

en-US Keynote I X  en-US GreenCom iThings CPSCom 2013   How Densely Should the Data Base Stations  B e Deployed in Hyper Cellular Networks   Professor Zhisheng Niu  Tsinghua National Lab for Information Science and Technology  Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China  E mail niuzhs@tsinghua.edu.cn    Abstract   One of the key approaches to make the mobile communication networks more GREEN Globally Resource optimized and Energy Efficient Networks\is to have the cellular architecture and radio resource allocation more adaptive to the environment and traffic varia tions including making some lightly loaded base stations \(BSs\go to sleep. This is the concept of so called TANGO \(Traffic Aware Network planning and Green Operation and CHORUS Collaborative and Harmonized Open Radio Ubiquitous Systems published by th e author earlier. To realize this, a new cellular framework, named hyper cellular networks HCN has been proposed in which the coverage of control signals is decoupled from the coverage of data signals so that the data coverage can be more elastic in ac cordance with the dynamics of traffic characteristics and QoS requirements. Specifically, the data base stations \(DBSs\in HCN can be densely deployed during peak traffic time in order to satisfy the capacity requirement, while a portion of DBSs can be swi tched off or go to sleep mode if the traffic load is lower than a threshold in order to save energy. A fundamental question then arises how densely should the DBSs be deployed in order to balance the QoS requirements and the energy consumption in hyper ce llular networks     In this talk, we characterize the optimal DBS density for both homogeneous and heterogeneous hyper cellular networks to minimize network cost with stochastic geometry theory For homogeneous cases both upper and lower bounds of the optimal DBS density are derived For heterogeneous cases our analysis reveals the best type of DBSs to be deployed for capacity extension or to be switched off for energy saving. Specifically, if the ratio between the micro DBS cost and the macro DBS cost  is lower than a threshold which is a function of path loss and their transmit power then the optimal strategy is to deploy micro DBSs for capacity extension or to switch off macro DBSs \(if possible\for energy saving with higher priority Otherwise the  optimal strategy is the opposite Based on the parameters from EARTH numerical results show that in the dense urban scenario compared to the traditional macro only homogeneous cellular network with no DBS sleeping deploying micro DBSs can reduce about 40 of the total energy cost, and further reduce about 20% with DBS sleeping capability   Bio   Zhisheng Niu graduated from Northern Jiaotong University currently Beijing Jiaotong University Beijing China in 1985 and got his M.E and D.E degrees fr om Toyohashi University of Technology Toyohashi, Japan, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.
