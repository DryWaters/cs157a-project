I I NTRODUCTION Cloud computing attracts extensive attention from both industry and academic because of its advantages in cost stability and exibility While Software-as-a-Service SaaS and Payas-You-Go scheme grant cloud computing vast exibility they also increase the complexity of task scheduling and quality assurance Subsequently current 
de facto 
service models still stick to the hourly renting model which still assigns the resources in unit of virtual machines and restricts the system throughput of the cloud hosting system However this situation would be dramatically improved by two methods One is to adjust the executing order of 
tasks according to their predicted runtime which aims at maximizing the resource utilization The other is to change the traditional resource provisioning pattern For instance the resources such as CPU time and memory could be allocated in unit of tasks rather than virtual machines That is instead of requiring the users calculating how many resources the tasks need and renting virtual machines accordingly the cloud computing system is expected to predict the performance and optimize the system throughput with a reasonable turnaround time automatically Anyway performance estimation is a challenging problem on which researchers have spent decades with different input from CPU level compiler level or system le v el 19 
To make a reliable estimation on the key metrics such as expected runtime memory utilization and CPU utilization etc a comprehensive model is necessary based on the descriptive factors or 
features 
of the task But viewing from a cloud computing perspective new challenges and opportunities are posed on the traditional performance prediction problem First CPU or compiler level approaches may not t the cloud scenario because source code required by the compiler based approaches or special hardware required by the CPU based approaches are often unavailable in the cloud Second to support the further processing such as resource provisioning 
and scheduling performance prediction of cloud services does not require perfect accuracy but is expected to be an online and responsive algorithm In addition existing approaches have not provided a clear model between the extracted features other than those from the source code and performance metrics thus restricting their applications in practice Motivated by these three differences of the performance prediction of cloud services in this paper we explore a machine learning based approach which treats each task as a black box and aims to regress the performance metrics as a function of the domain-speciìc 
features 
of the task More speciìcally we use the historical instances of the same type 
of service as training data and treat each instance as a point in an

dimension feature space And then a kernel density estimator is used to predict the performance measurement of the test task by combining the information from the Nearest Neighbors  NNs where k for each test task depends on the speciìc circumstances in the feature space To the best of the authors knowledge it is the rst time a machine learning based performance prediction algorithm specially tailored for cloud computing environment is proposed And we summarize our contributions as below 
002 002 
We propose a resource management system framework which combines performance prediction with SLA requirements to conduct the resource provisioning and task scheduling in cloud We introduce an online density based performance prediction model for cloud services based on a large number of historical instances containing categorical and continuous parameter values and input information each Noticeably larger historical information indicates more accuracy Meanwhile with the limit historical information in practice our model still performs better than other traditional models

We collect the service information on a high performance computing platform which provides Vienna Abinitio Simulation Package VASP service to build a small dataset containing 148 instances with 18 features Experimental results indicate the capability and performance of our proposed model and also verify that our model is more efìcient than others Besides a concrete situation which may often occur in the real world is simulated on 5 to demonstrate the importance of performance prediction models The remaining of the paper is organized as follows Section II reviews relevant researches related to performance prediction and highlights the relevance of our work for cloud computing The proposed methodology is presented in section III In section IV we describe the practical dataset obtained from the high performance computing platform In section V experiments are performed and analyzed Finally conclusion and future work are summarized in section VI II A N R EVIEW OF R ELATED W ORK The problem of service performance prediction can be divided into two categories One is to predict the performance of interactive services such as web services Pacheco-Sanchez et al investigated the Markovian Arrival Processes MAP and MAP/MAP/1 queueing model as a tool for performance prediction to provision cloud resources W ebProphet 13 employed a novel technique based on timing perturbation to automate performance prediction for web services And Reddy et al simulated the web services model to analyze and predict the performance metrics The other is to predict the performance of non-interactive services such as off-line bagof-tasks etc In this paper we focus on the latter to predict the performance of non-interactive services in cloud To our knowledge the oldest method to predict performence metrics of non-interactive algorithms and services is based on the analysis of source code which gradually fades away for the reason that source code can hardly be acquired in practical situations To solve this problem researchers turn their attention to statistical and learning based techniques In the middle of 1990s Brewer in 2 used linear re gression models based on empirical measurements to predict the runtime of different implementations of portable high-level libraries for multiprocessors aiming to select the best one Nevertheless he only studied on the sub-quadratic-time algorithms while the linear regression models didnêt work well in other cases As what we can learn from Brewerês case function based performance prediction models cannot be general due to the reason that different algorithms vary dramatically in terms of time complexity and we canêt learn all the performance measurement through certain linear regression models Frank Hutter used both linear re gression models and e xact Gaussian processes to model the relevance between runtime and instance features However the methods only did a good job on small and continuous feature space and the computational expense was great Ling Huang et al 12 17 18 used ridge regression models to predict algorithm runtimes for its simplicity However the prediction performance was barely satisfactory SVM method was proposed in to predict runtime of algorithms which was very time consuming and performed terrible Regression Tree method introduced in  stood out in performance prediction in comparison with other methods Unfortunately the performance of the regression tree method didnêt hold rm and it depended on datasets to a large extent Dodonov et al 7 emplo yed neural network techniques to predict performance of algorithms and services while these methods needed a speciìc model to guide the learning process which was not available for ones unfamiliar with the predicted services or algorithms As cloud computing appears on the horizon researchers tend to rent machines in cloud doing their jobs instead of running them on specialized clusters With numerous tasks of various services waiting to be executed in cloud scheduling and provisioning policies are necessary of which performance prediction is the fundamental However there are some new challenges to performance prediction in cloud computing For the security consideration the source code of tasks executing in cloud is not provided which means we should estimate the performance measurements by empirical information from logs etc Considering the consecutiveness and abundance of tasks the predicting algorithm should be online and lightweighted Generally speaking the deadline is required by users in days Consequently wider criteria of accuracy of performance prediction can be accepted The methods proposed by past works can not solve all the new challenges Instead we proposed a novel density based performance prediction model for cloud services with low time complexity III D ENSITY B ASED P ERFORMANCE P REDICTION M ODEL The majority of existing resource management systems in cloud are designed to schedule tasks directly while the minority take quality of service\(QoS into account Few of them think highly of the performance prediction model However traditional resource management systems paying less attention to performance prediction of tasks may encounter inefìciency Over provisioned resources may cause waste while inadequate resources may delay the tasks In order to maximize both the task completion rate and system resource utilization we precompute the resources needed by the task using performance prediction model consider the userês SLA requirement and nally make an appropriate decision on resource provisioning The framework of our resource management system in cloud is shown in Fig 1 Submitted tasks join in the task queue in order and wait to be processed Analyzes the tasks and proìles them with signiìcant features and conìguration parameters Predicts the performance of tasks using approapriate performance prediction models in a performance prediction toolbox Transforms the userês QoS requirements from natural language to logical forms such as XML

SLA Bargainer Task Scheduler VM Monitor 
Compares the performance prediction results with the userês QoS requirements together with the available resources in cloud to make service level agreement\(SLA Schedules the tasks to the resources tailed by performance predictor and SLA bargainer Monitors the state of virtual machines\(VM and tasks in order to make appropriate migration policies in time The rationale of our proposed density based performance prediction model is that based on the contiguity hypothesis we expect an instance to have similar characteristics with ones in the neighborhood In line with such a rationale we rst nd several nearest neighbors of a predicted instance and the performance prediction will be made in association with performance measurements of the neighbors In principle our proposed density based performance prediction model can predict any type of performance measures such as runtime max memory usage communication overhead I/O consumption etc For brevity we use runtime as the performance measure to evaluate our proposed model Details will be described in this section We describe a task of some service as an instance by a list of m features     e xtracted from a feature space  and a set of t conìguration parameters      dra wn from a conìguration space  The features describe characteristics of the given task instance such as the size of the given task and the number of loops etc The conìgurations refer to the parameters needed in the task Both the features and the conìgurations are the values which can signiìcantly affect the runtime We deìne the input space as a combination of feature and conìguration spaces   The performance predictions will fall into the real number eld  Given task instances of the same service with a feature space and a conìguration space  a density based performance prediction model is an approximate progress  To build the prediction model on an instance set of the same service we search the logs to extract the conìgurations and features  Also runtime should be extracted as  We combine the m-dimension feature vector and t-dimension conìguration vector as a dimension vector referred as predictor variables  The training data then can be represented as Weuse to denote n instances and for the vector of runtime When there comes a new task instance we extract the features and conìgurations to generate  Then we increase by 1 from 2 We denote the nearest neighbors as and the distance between the nearest neighobrs and the new task instance are  The is nally determined when the 1 rst reaches the maxima We use the performance of nearest neighbors for reference to estimate the performance of a new task instance However the contribution of each neighbor to predict the performance of the new instance is different and is closely related to the Euclidean distance between the new instance and the neighbor Suppose the distance between a new instance and one of its neighbors is and the contribution of the neighbor to help predict performance of the new instance is  then 
Fig 1 Framework of resource management system in cloud Before a task is assigned to some virtual machines performance prediction should be made on it The results will be compared with the userês original QoS requirements and available resources in cloud to help make SLA If the agreements falls through the task will be reject Otherwise the task will be assigned to the VMs by task scheduler During the execution the states of VMs and tasks are monitored to make appropriate migration policies in time

Meanwhile we also assessed the conìdence of our proposed model To evaluate these models with different datasets\(i.e varying in size dimensionality etc we totally used 6 datasets ranging from the real-world one described in section IV and others obtained from Details of each dataset are presented in Table I Finally a concrete situation was simulated on CloudSim to conìrm the signiìcance of our perforamnce prediction model We performed our experiments on a Lenovo B710 blade server which has eight AMD 800MHz cores 32GB RAM and a 100GB hard disk All experiments are repeated with 10 random trials TABLE I D ESCRIPTION OF D ATASETS Dataset vasp Concorde SWV Minisat RCW CORLAT Size 148 111 1245 765 1980 5840 Feature 18 65 136 135 72 106 Given a set of observed runtime values  we get predictions and variances through a prediction model The prediction of a certain distribution allows us to assess the modelês conìdence To ensure the fairness of evaluation we use the following four metrics to synthetically study the models conìdence 1 a frequently used measure of the differences between values predicted by an estimator and values actually observed RMSE is deìned as and lower values are better 2 a measure of the linear correlation between two variables giving a value between and inclusive It is deìned as  Higher values are better 3 a measure to describe a function of a parameter given an outcome It is deìned as  where denotes the probability density function of a standard normal distribution Higher values are better 4 a measure of how well a set of predicted values compares to a corresponding set of observed values It is deìned as  The closer the value is to zero the better the prediction model In this section we compare our density based performance prediction model with typical prediction models described in section II by ve datasets The evaluation measures and goodness-of-ìt conditions are shown in Table II and Fig 2 As shown in Table II Ridge model always executes fastest while the accuracy of the model is unacceptable Gaussian Process\(GP and SVM methods always take a lot more time doing mediocre predictions The neural network method radial basis function\(RBF performs poorly in terms of accuracy and time consumption Regression Tree\(RTree method holds unconstant performance on various datasets Compared with other prediction models our proposed density based performance prediction model\(DWDist is particularly noteworthy since it does a good job on accuracy and time consumption Besides the performance of our model is not as sensitive as other prediction models to datasets Fig 2 visually reveals the performance of different prediction models Some subplots have fewer points since negative values are ignored It can be perceived that GP Ridge and SVM methods sometimes predict negative values which are less consultative for subsequent provisioning or scheduling RBF and RTree methods perform barely satisfactory but sometimes are excessively sensitive to datasets Generally speaking our DWDist model performs best compared with the typical prediction models despite some aws in some cases Taking the Concorde as an example the performance of our model is obviously better than others however it is worse when compared to other datasets using our model for runtime prediction The probable reason for the relatively terrible performance is that the instances in the dataset are sparse According to our rale mentioned above predicted instances with dense instances around can achieve high prediction accuracy Otherwise the accuracy will be inîuenced negatively The preceding indicates that our density based performance prediction model is better than typical performance models To strengthen the thesis we further experiment each model on  which is derived from the real scenario and has practical signiìcance The size of this dataset is relatively small However compared with other prediction models our model still performs noticeably well TABLE III QUANTITATIVE COMPARISION OF MODELS FOR RUNTIME PREDICTION ON dataset contains 148 instances with 18 features each We randomly choose 18 instances for prediction and remaining as training data Table III Fig 3 and Fig 4\(Predictions using RBF model arenêt shown on the gure since there are too many negative values evaluate the prediction in terms of quantity and visual sense respectively Intuitively Ridge regression and SVM methods perform terrible on runtime prediction Other methods have obvious deìciencies when predicting some instances Fig 5 describes the performance of remaining prediction models by bar diagram The upper subplot shows the prediction distribution

Fig 6 Completion rate of tasks under FCFS and PR scheduling policies FCFS means rst come rst served and PR means resorting the tasks queue according to the performance prediction results of tasks curves join together nally since the completion rate is 100 when the deadline is long enough In the practical situation the deadlines cannot be deìned that long As a consequence predicting the performance of tasks and rearranging the tasks executing order are very meaningful VI C ONCLUSION F UTURE W ORK Performance prediction is important for many applications Making effective resource provisioning and scheduling policies in cloud depends on a good prediction of performance of tasks Nevertheless the requirements of performance prediction models for cloud services are slightly different from the traditional models Cloud services are usually from the third party and not open source The relationship between the input\(containing the system conìguration parameters of cloud services and performance measurements is ambiguous Whatês more compared with accuracy time consumption of the prediction model is the critical consideration Most of the previous researches on performance prediction models for cloud services have aws either in accuracy or time consumption In this paper we design a density based performance prediction model which can predict performance of cloud services well in terms of accuracy and time consumption Furthermore we also build a practical dataset and experiment various performance prediction models on this dataset Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed performance prediction model can achieve satisfactory results with a few time consumption in practical situations Thus our density based performance prediction is preferable for cloud services Although our model performs better than other typical performance prediction models itês still far from perfect in accuracy In our future work we are going to improve the density kernel algorithm to achieve higher accuracy Furthermore we are going to apply the density based prediction model to resource provision and scheduling on LSF to help increase system resource
