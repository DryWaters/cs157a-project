Correlation-based Performance Analysis fo r Full-System MapReduce Optimization Qi Guo 1 YanLi 1 TaoLiu 1  Kun Wang 1  Guancheng Chen 1 XiaomingBao 2  Wentao Tang 2 1 IBM Research China Beijing China 2 IBM Systems  Technology Group Beijing China Abstract Big Data is changing this world at a surprising speed and MapReduce plays a critical role in nding insights in Big Data However to efìciently extract insights from Big Data performance optimization of MapReduce applications is a challenging task To facilitate the full-system optimization of MapReduce applications we propose a correlation-based performance analysis approach to efìciently identify critical outliers  The basic intuition is that critical outliers are key to the overall performance and they can only be accurately identiìed by correlating different phases tasks and resources Based on the proposed approach we further implement a correlation-based performance analysis tool called S ONATA It can efìciently identify critical outliers and then recommend optimization suggestions for practitioners based on embedded rules Since the performance overhead is key to the applicability of a performance tool we conduct experiments to demonstrate that S ONATA is a practical tool with less than 5 overhead and good scalability To demonstrate the effectiveness of S ONATA  we share several cases during the performance tuning of IBM Platform Symphony TM with the help of S ONATA  Keywords Big Data MapReduce Performance Analysis Optimization I I NTRODUCTION The ever-increasing volumes of data pose signiìcant challenges on distributed computing technology As one of the most popular programming paradigms to address these challenges MapReduce 1 has been widely u s e d i n industry Actually following Googleês MapReduce there also exists many varieties such as Apache Hadoop Cloudera Enterprise 3 IB M I nfoS phere B i gIns i ght s TM 4 IBM Platform Symphony TM  and s o on Despite various underlying implementations of the MapReduce runtime the performance optimization of MapReduce applications is still a great challenge since there exists numerous adjustable parameters in MapReduce framework For example Hadoop MapReduce contains more than 150 conìguration parameters that may have nontrivial impacts on the performance To make the tuning of MapReduce framework tractable several approaches have been proposed to automatically determine the near-optimal MapReduce parameters with small overheads 6 7  In addition to the parameters of MapReduce framework the performance of MapReduce execution is also heavily determined by conìgurations from other layers such as JVM operating system virtual machine and hardware Thus it is expected that a ne-grained full-system co-optimization technique could have potential to signiìcantly improve the performance As an illustrative example during the practice of tuning Terasort to be executed on a 10-node IBM PowerLinux TM 7R2 cluster we found that the performance improvement comes from different sources In more detail about 30 and 20 performance improvements stem from system software level JVM Garbage Collection GC and Huge Page etc tuning and underlying hardware level tuning Turbo mode SMT Simultaneous multithreading and hardware prefetching etc respectively Nevertheless due to the involvement of many parameters from different layers the tuning process is much more complicated and always requires specialized expertise To ease the burden of full-system optimization in this paper we propose a novel full-system MapReduce optimization approach based on correlation-based performance analysis The intuition is that the overall performance of MapReduce applications is always determined by the critical outliers  for example the slowest map or reduce tasks that determine the overall execu tion Thus identifying critical outliers is most important for performance optimization of MapReduce applications Actually the critical outliers can only be accurately detected by correlating different subphases of a task tasks e.g map/reduce tasks and resources e.g CPU Memory and Disk In other words it is necessary to conduct correlation-based analysis to identify the real performance issues Once performance issues are identiìed some empirical rules could be applied to guide the practitioners to optimize the overall performance Based on the proposed correlation-based analysis approach we implement a full-system MapReduce performance analysis tool which is called as S ONATA onIBM Platform Symphony TM  Apparently to make such an instrumentation-based performance t ool viable the additional performance overhead should be low enough To evaluate the performance overhead of S ONATA  we conduct experiments with several widely-used MapReduce benchmarks The experimental results show that S ONATA only causes less than 5 additional performance overhead for the evaluated benchmarks which well demonstrates the efìciency of S ONATA  To demonstrate the effectiveness of S ONATA wepresent several cases during the tuning of Terasort on IBM PowerLinux TM 7R2 systems running IBM Platform Symphony TM  Our experiences show that correlation-based performance analysis is indeed very effective and efìcient 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 753 


for full-system performance optimization and we manage to sort 1TB data in 7 minutes on 10-node PowerLinux TM 7R2 systems running IBM Platform Symphony TM  The rest of the paper proceeds as follows Section II introduces background of MapReduce programming model and the importance of critical outliers for performance tuning Section III elaborat es the proposed correlation-based performance analysis Section IV details the implementation of S ONATA  Section V evaluates the performance overhead and scalability of S ONATA  Section VI presents several case studies of S ONATA  Section VII compares S ONATA with other MapReduce optimization approaches Finally section VIII concludes this paper II B ACKGROUND A MapReduce Background The MapReduce programming paradigm executes a job in two phases Map and Reduce  In the map phase several map tasks are executed in parallel to process the corresponding input data After all map tasks nished the intermediate results are transferred to the reduce tasks for further processing The map and reduce tasks communicate with a master node which dominates the MapReduce process in the centralized control system In a typical implementation of MapReduce runtime such as Apache Hadoop the primary controlling component on the master node is referred as Job Tracker JT while the secondary controlling threads on slave nodes are referred as Task Trackers TT The functions of the map and reduce tasks are usually deìned and rely on the particular missions required by applications Under this framework the map and reduce tasks can implement massive data parallelism for large-scale data processing  B Critical Outliers The execution of one MapReduce job consists of several parallel tasks and outlier tasks refer to the tasks that take longer to nish than other similar tasks In addition to these task-level outliers there also exists outliers in different level such as phase-level and resource-level outliers The phaselevel outliers are phases that dominate the entire execution of a task The resource-level outliers are abnormal behaviors of resource usages for example CPU is not fully utilized disk access is much slower than that of other nodes and memory usage is over-used compared with that of other nodes Although outliers exhibit different behaviors compared with their counterparts they may not have signiìcant impacts on the overall performance For example the outlier tasks do not lie in the critical path will not postpone all subsequent execution Therefore only critical outliers should be identiìed for performance diagnosis and optimization However as the size of clusters e.g a cluster contains more than 2000 nodes has been deployed at Taobao 8 and the parallelism of jobs i.e tens of thousands of tasks are executed in parallel continue to grow the identiìcation of critical outliers is extremely complicated and timeconsuming for engineers in industrial practice III C ORRELATION BASED P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS In this section we introduce the proposed correlationbased performance analysis approach to effectively and efìciently identify critical outliers The basic intuition of correlation-based performance analysis is to correlate different phases tasks and resources to effectively and efìciently identify critical outliers As shown in Figure 1 all those correlations can be roughly grouped into 4 classes that is phase-phase correlations task-task correlations task-resource correlations and resource-resource correlations Figure 1 All correlations can be grouped into four types that is phasephase task-task task-resource and resource-resource correlations A Phase-Phase Correlations The correlation between different phases is utilized to identify the critical phases of one taskês execution This correlation is especially useful for the optimization of MapReduce runtime engine By dividing the execution of one task into different important subphases and then instrumenting them during execution the designers of MapReduce engines can easily identify the critical paths for potential optimization For example during the performance optimization of a MapReduce engine when encountering longtail reduce tasks multi-threaded processing is a potential solution to accelerate these tasks In addition to the designers of MapReduce engines the end-users can also beneìt from such correlations For example they can quantitatively compare the execution details of di fferent implementations of user-deìned routines and then improve the efìciency accordingly B Task-Task Correlations The correlations between task s mainly target to identify the slow map or reduce tasks Although the identiìcation of slow tasks is straightforward it is non-trivial to reveal the underlying reasons of such phenomenons To offer more insights of such slow tasks we further consider two types of task-task correlations that is inter-node and intra-node task-task correlations 754 


During the performance analysis inter-node correlations help to easily identify the slow tasks among all nodes Once a number of tasks are recognized as the slow tasks we should further verify whether such tasks are on the same node Once such tasks are executed on different nodes we should mainly examine the data input size of each task to determine unbalanced data partition Otherwise we should check the system conìguration of the node where the slow tasks are running Moreover for an abnormal node the intranode correlations can identify the slow tasks running on it Since the system conìguration is the same for all tasks on this node the unbalanced data partition and scheduling issues e.g inappropriate setting of task slots could be considered as the main reasons for the slow tasks C Task-Resource Correlations Once critical outliers of tasks are identiìed the correlations between such tasks and the corresponding resources are used to identify the critical outliers of resources e.g the low usage of resources that may impair the overall performance As shown in Figure 2 task 1469 is rst identiìed as a critical outlier since it delays the overall execution of the map phase Since task 1469 is executed on node JUNO2 we correlate it with the resources on node JUNO2 With respect to the CPU utilization we can see that during the execution of task 1469  the CPU utilization drops signiìcantly To improve the CPU utilization in the transition from the map tasks to the reduce tasks we could start the shufîe phases earlier or schedule more reduce tasks to this node to occupy the CPU D Resource-Resource Correlations The correlations between different resources are also useful for performance diagnosis and optimization Similar to task-task correlations there are two kinds of resourceresource correlations that is inter-node and intra-node correlations The inter-node correlations are conducted by correlating the same resources e.g network between different nodes As a result the abnormal resource usage can be easily identiìed For example a slow network adapter may delay the shufîe phases to all nodes In this case the critical tasks are not easy to identify since the shufîe phases of all tasks are postponed this performance issue can only be detected by conducting inter-node resource-resource correlation The intra-node correlation is conducted by correlating different resources on the same node and potential performance optimization might be adopted accordingly As shown in Figure 3 the total network bandwidth is about 1.3GB/s while the corresponding CPU usage is more than 95 In this case since two 10GbE network cards are used for internode communication the main bottleneck is the CPU usage Actually the large data transfer rate also aggravates the load of CPU usage To ease this burden RDMA Remote Direct Figure 2 The correlation between task and resource to identify tasks or phases that are bottlenecks Memory Access would be a very promising technique to release CPU from costly data copy operations 9 t o further improve the overall performance Figure 3 The correlation of resource and resource to identify potential performance optimization E Workîow of correlation-based performance analysis Based on four types of correlations Algorithm 1 shows the basic workîow to conduct correlation-based performance analysis to effectively and efìciently identify critical outliers The rst step is to utilize inter-node tasktask correlations to identify a task set T contains critical outliers of tasks Then intra-node task-task correlations can 755 


determine whether all tasks or a subset of tasks in T run on the same node For each task t i in task set T taskresource correlations should be leveraged to identify whether the corresponding resources are outliers Besides phasephase correlations can be used to determine the most timeconsuming phases for each outlier task Even when there is no critical task in other words all tasks are completed very close inter-node resource-resource correlations could be used to diagnose whether resource issues exist Moreover intra-node resource-resource correlations could offer more insights to determine potential performance optimization Finally phase-phase correlations on the task with averaged statistics could provide suggestions for the optimization of user-deìned routines or runtime engines Algorithm 1 Workîow of correlation-based performance analysis T  critical outliers of tasks determined by inter-node task-task correlations intra-node task-task correlations to determine whether subsets T s  T are on the same node for t i  T do task-resource correlations on t i to nd outliers of resources phase-phase correlations on t i to nd critical outliers of phases end inter-node resource-resource correlations to diagnose resource issues intra-node resource-resource correlations to determine potential optimization phase-phase correlations on t avg nd critical outliers of phases IV S ONATA F ULL S YSTEM M AP R EDUCE P ERFORMANCE A NALYZER Based on the proposed correlation-based performance analysis we further implement S ONATA  a full-system performance analyzer that rst effectively and efìciently detects critical outliers and then recommends suggestions for potential optimization In this section we elaborate the detailed implementation of S ONATA  A Framework S ONATA consists of four main phases that is data collection  data loading  performance visualization and optimization recommendation  which can be illustrated in Figure 4 In data collection  two types of runtime statistics i.e execution details and resource usage on each node are collected and then they are aggregated at a speciìed master node In data loading  a data loader on the master node periodically retrieves data from aggregated statistics and writes them into the database In performance visualization  the collected runtime statistics are obtained from the database and displayed in a correlated mode via web-based performance visualizer Meanwhile when e nd-users using the visualizer to get a deep understanding of the MapReduceês behaviors the potential critical outliers could be efìciently identiìed and optimization suggestions are recommended by optimization recommendation  In the following sections we present details of each phases Figure 4 The framework of S ONATA for full-system MapReduce performance analysis B Data Collection As shown in Figure 5 there are two main components that is monitor and aggregator  for data collection The monitor is distributed on each node for gathering both the execution details of programs and hardware resource usage information The basic idea to collect the execution details of programs is based on the MapReduceês counters  which are useful mechanism to gather execution statistics and supported by most MapReduce implementations e.g Apache Hadoop and IBM Platform Symphony TM  In more detail we deìne several new counters for the interested execution phases for example the potential critical phases of MapReduce execution and then add speciìc codes on the source codes of runtime engine to update the corresponding counters during execution On the other hand to collect the hardware resource usage information such as CPU/memory usage disk and network bandwidth we leverage a lightweight performance monitoring tool i.e Ganglia 10 More s peci  cal l y  t he moni t o r  rs t reads t h e raw data from Ganglia and then generates organized data for processing by the aggregator Figure 5 The components for data collection The aggregator on the master node periodically collects the data from the monitors on all slave nodes Then the data are organized in XML format and written into a history le in order Figure 6 illustrates an XML item of the collected execution details in the history le To avoid a large size of the history les the aggregator also periodically ushes the data in current history les into out-of-date les 756 


Figure 6 The counter MAP COMPLETE TIME is stored in XML format for Task 2 in Job 24002  C Data Loading Since the data in current history le are temporary and it is non-trivial to efìciently manipulate le data for performance analysis we consider to store the collected data into the database which is implemented by the data loader The data loader which runs as a daemon on the master node periodically reads the history le and writes the XML items into the database The data loader can remember the last reading offset of the history le to avoid writing duplicate records into the database In addition to loading the history le into the database the data loader also intercepts the data generated by the aggregator  and then the intercepted information is also written into the database More speciìcally once the data loader is invoked at a scheduled time a new record along with the current timestamp will also be inserted into the database Apparently such dynamically updated information of running jobs is the basis of on-the-îy visualization and monitoring D Performance Visualization Currently in performance visualization four analysis views can be generated to present more insights of the execution of programs The rst one is the overall view  where the execution timelines of all map and reduce tasks are depicted Thus the users can easily observe information like how many tasks were running at any time point and how many map/reduce task waves The second one is the resource view  where the CPU/memory usage disk and network bandwidth are depicted The users can easily identify abnormal usage curves of speciìc nodes from this view The third one is the breakdown view of the execution of one speciìc map or reduce task and the users can easily identify the critical phases of one task Actually the above three views are correlated to facilitate the identiìcation of critical outliers For example once a task in the overall view is selected both the tasks running on the same node in the overall view and the resource usage curves in the resource view will be highlighted Besides the breakdown view will also display the execution details of the selected task The fourth view is a table to list the detailed execution statistics of the entire jobs for example the status of the job the average execution time of all map tasks and the HDFS written/read bytes etc E Optimization R ecommendation Figure 7 An illustrate example to automatically diagnose the hardware conìgurations Although end-users could only rely on the visualizer to conduct performance analysis it would be very helpful to automatically determine critical outliers and thus provide optimization recommendations for inexperience users Thus in the optimization engine we embedded several empirical rules to recommend tuning guidelines for potential performance improvements Figure 7 shows an illustrative example to automatically diagnose the hardware conìgurations and present the optimization recommendations In this example by conducting task-task correlation it can be easily found that only tasks on node JUNO2 e.g task 2584  are the critical outliers which indicates that there exists performance issues on JUNO2 To identify the root cause of this observation we further perform task-resource and resource-resource correlations We found that on JUNO2 the CPU usage is overutilized   99 but the network access is underutilized the maximal disk write speed is only 170MB/s compared with other nodes which implies that CPU of JUNO2 is one of critical outliers of this execution Thus S ONATA recommends to check the CPU-related conìgurations for example the SMT setting hardware prefetching and CPU 757 


frequency Finally we identify that this problem is caused by setting the SMT as 2 on JUNO2 while on other nodes the SMT is set as 4 Actually such domain knowledge could be easily summarized as an empirical rule as shown in Figure 8 Figure 8 The example in Figure 7 can be summarized as an empirical rule for automatic optimization recommendation V P ERFORMANCE E VA L UAT I O N In this section we evaluate the performance overhead and scalability of S ONATA  which has been deployed on IBM Platform Symphony TM  A Experimental Methodology The MapReduce benchmarks for evaluation are widelyused Terasort and Wordcount  and the corresponding data sets are 1TB data from Tera Gen and 210GB data from Bible.txt  respectively The cluster we used for evaluation consists of up to 10 POWER7 TM R2 servers each contains 2 POWER7 TM chips and each chip has 32 hardware threads The detailed information of the evaluated cluster is listed in Table I Table I E VALUATED IBM POWER7 C LUSTERS Cluster 10 PowerLinux TM 7R2 Servers CPU 16 processor cores per server 160 total Memory 128GB per server 1280GB total Internal 6 600GB internal SAS drives Storage per server 36TB total Expansion 24 600GB SAS drives in IBM EXP24S SFF Storage Gen2-bay Drawer per server\(144TB total Network 2 10GBe connections per server Switch BNT BLADE RackSwitch G8264 The performance of MapReduce benchmarks is measured by the end-to-end execution time of a job To resist stochastic effects we run each benchmark ve times and only the minimal value is treated as the measured performance By comparing the performance of benchmarks running on the original IBM Platform Symphony TM and the version attached with S ONATA  we can quantify the additional performance overhead caused by S ONATA  B Runtime Overheads Figure 9 shows the performance overhead of S ONATA with respect to the original IBM Platform Symphony TM  on 5and 10-node clusters The rst observation is that the additional overhead caused by S ONATA is very low for the evaluated benchmarks For example even for benchmark Terasort running on the 10-node cluster the performance overhead is only 3.5 The second observation is that the additional performance overhead may vary for different benchmarks For benchmark Wordcount  the performance overhead is only 1.5 when running on 10-node cluster The third observation is that even increasing the number of nodes the performance overhead does not increase signiìcantly for the evaluated benchmarks Figure 9 The execution overhead of S ONATA compared with the original execution time without instrumentation The instrumented counters are collected for each task and the number of tasks typically increases along with the data sizes For example when sorting 512GB data the number of map tasks is only 1432 while sorting 1.5TB data the number of map tasks increases to 2796 Therefore the performance overhead may vary given different number of tasks To evaluate the scalability of S ONATA  we measure the performance of Terasort given 512GB 1TB and 1.5TB data As shown in Figure 10 we can see that given different number of tasks the performance overhead does not vary signiìcantly and the maximal execution overhead is still less than 5 Thus the results from our test cases suggest that S ONATA will a practical tool when deployed in commercial environments Figure 10 The scalability of S ONATA for different size of tasks VI C ASE S TUDIES In this section we share our experiences on tuning the full-system performance of Terasort running against IBM Platform Symphony TM on a IBM POWER7 TM cluster with the help of S ONATA  During the tuning process the performance issues we encountered can be roughly grouped into three 758 


main categories that is system problems  inappropriate runtime conìgurations and runtime inefìciency  A Diagnosing System Problems In addition to the example shown in Figure 7 where S ONATA can efìciently facilitate the identiìcation of inappropriate conìgurations of CPU e.g SMT prefetching and frequency setting we further present an example to illustrate that an abnormal disk behavior can also be detected by S ONATA  As shown in Figure 11 several reduce tasks on JUNO1 are critical outliers that postpone the overall execution time By correlating the tasks with the disk resources of the corresponding nodes we found that the total disk loads on JUNO1   1  72 GB/s are much more heavier than that of other nodes e.g  864 MB/s on node JUNO9 Figure 11 Diagnosing disk problem via S ONATA  Disk loads of node JUNO1 are much more heavier than that of other nodes e.g node JUNO9 By examining the operations during the execution of this job we nally identify that other users have run a disk benchmark on JUNO1 in the same time slot since this cluster was shared by several teams After that we obtain exclusive access to this cluster to avoid inferences from other teams B Tuning Runtime Conìgurations Similar to Hadoop MapReduce there also exists many adjustable conìgurations in IBM Platform Symphony TM for MapReduce practitioners Here we list three cases to illustrate how S ONATA can help optimize the runtime conìgurations The rst tuning case is about the buffer usage in map tasks as shown in Figure 12 In this example it can be easily identiìed the critical tasks such as task 402 by conducting task-task correlation Actually during the execution of this task we can see that multiple sorts and spills i.e 2 sorts and spills occur Due to multiple sorts and spills the resultant overhead is more than 49 of the overall map time By identifying that the overhead of sorts and spills is larger than a predeìned threshold e.g 20 S ONATA recommends to adjust the buffer-related parameters for example increase the parameter such as io.sort.mb  By increasing this parameter multiple sorts and spills could be completely eliminated and the overall performance is improved accordingly Figure 12 By correlating phase-phase correlation for critical tasks potential optimization could be recommended accordingly In this example there are multiple costly sorts and spills in the critical map task They could be eliminated by enlarging the parameter such as io.sort.mb  The second example is about the tuning of another critical parameter slowstart  for IBM Platform Symphony TM which determines the fraction of the number of map tasks that should be complete before reduce tasks are scheduled As shown in Figure 13 the bottom gure by correlating different phases in a critical reduce task the WaitInFetch phase is most time-consuming in shufîe  which occupies more than 99 of the overall execution time of the reduce task Moreover by correlating tasks with the resource usage the middle gure the corresponding CPU is not 100 fully utilized i.e 89 in shufîe  Thus we could consider to increase the value of slowstart to release more reduce slots to map slots before the completion of all map tasks The third tuning case is about the selection of appropriate compressors for data output When sorting 1TB data via Terasort  by conducting phase-phase correlation for one critical map task the shufîe phase which transfers data from the map tasks to the reduce tasks dominates the entire execution time e.g more than 70 It is intuitive to compress the data to reduce the IO disk and network overheads which is well supported by most MapReduce runtime engines Since the efìciencies of different compressors vary signiìcantly S ONATA can efìciently compare the performance of different compressors and recommend the best for further usage By comparing the performance of DefaultCodec zip and Lz4Codec compressors we found that the overall execution time of Default compressor is about 1.5 times longer than that of Lz4 compressor Besides 759 


Figure 13 By correlating the slow reduce tasks with their subphases the WaitInFetch phase is more than 99 of the overall execution time Besides the CPU is not fully utilized during the shufîe phase Thus we could increase slowstart to let more map tasks scheduled for execution by utilizing Lz4 compressor the shufîe ratio with respect to the execution time of reduce tasks can be reduced by 118 C Improving Runtime Efìciency In addition to the MapReduce practitioners the performance tool is also very helpful for the runtime designers to optimize the implementation of MapReduce engines In Apache Hadoop the map and the reduce slots can only be used for the map and the reduce tasks respectively In IBM Platform Symphony TM  the default conìguration also follows this guideline that slots cannot be shared by the map and the reduce tasks Figure 14 shows the execution behaviors of Terasort when setting 32 map slots and 32 reduce slots on each PowerLinux TM 7R2 node which contains 64 hardware threads Apparently we can see that during the rst wave of map execution the CPU utilization is relatively low on this cluster e.g the CPU utilization of node JUNO0 is less than 37 To improve the utilization of CPU IBM Platform Symphony TM offers generic slots that can be shared between the map tasks and the reduce tasks Figure 15 shows that given the same MapReduce parameters by sharing slots between the map and the reduce tasks the CPU utilization can be signiìcantly improved to more than 50 for node JUNO0 In this case the generic slots can improve the overall performance by 12.99 compared with the separated Figure 14 Terasort running with separated map and reduce task slots slots 485s vs 422s Figure 15 Terasort running with shared map and reduce task slots VII R ELATED W ORK There exists a number of research efforts to propose performance analysis approaches and tools for efìcient MapReduce processing Mantri is a system that monitors tasks and culls outliers using causeand resource-aware techniques 11 Al t hough Mantri also focused on optimizing outliers it can only address task-level outliers In contrast S ONATA facilitates the full-system performance optimization by identifying phaselevel task-level and resource-level outliers HiTune is a scalable lightweight and extensible performance analyzer for Hadoop MapReduce based on dataîowbased performance analysis 12 Al t hough Hi T une al s o shows the execution details of tasks and resource usages as S ONATA does it cannot directly provide the correlations among phases tasks and resources which are most important 760 


to efìciently identify critical outliers Moreover S ONATA can monitor the behaviors of a jobês execution on-the-îy to facilitate online optimization while HiTune only offers post-execution performance analysis Starìsh is a self-tuning system that enables Hadoop users to get good performance automatically without deep understanding of many tuning knobs available 7  O ne of the key features of Starìsh is that it can automatically set the near-optimal parameters for Hadoop jobs However Starìsh mainly focuses on the tuning of the parameters of Hadoop framework which cannot be used to optimize the runtime engines and diagnose hardware problems In other words Starìsh cannot facilitate full-system optimization Theia 13 i s a vis u alization t ool to generate visual signatures of each jobês performance by analyzing the applicationlevel logs of a Hadoop cluster The visual signatures facilitate troubleshooting the performance problems e.g hardware failure data skew and software bugs etc on the cluster However Theia cannot tackle with misconìgurations of runtime engine and underlying hardware Hadoop vaidya is a rule-based performance diagnostic tool for MapReduce jobs 14 Al t hough i t can pro vi de recommendations based on the analysis of runtime statistics it cannot facilitate full-system optimization PerfXPlain is a system enables users to ask questions about the relative performances i.e runtimes of pairs of MapReduce jobs 15 Ho we v e r  t h i s s y s t em mai nl y focus es on e xpl ai ni ng the performance similarity or difference between pairs of MapReduce job or task executions In summary current approaches mainly target to the optimization of MapReduce parameters which cannot be helpful for full-system optimization In contrast by correlating different phases tasks and resources S ONATA is able to efìciently identify critical outliers for full-system optimization Besides the monitoring capability of S ONATA can facilitate the online optimization of MapReduce applications VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we present a correlation-based performance analysis approach to efìciently identify the critical outliers for full-system MapReduce optimization The key intuition is that the critical outliers can only be accurately and efìciently identiìed by correlating different phases tasks and hardware resources Once critical outliers are identiìed several empirical optimization rules can be deployed to tame them The proposed approach is further implemented as a tool named as S ONATA S ONATA has been deployed on IBM Platform Symphony TM  and experimental results show that it only causes less than 5 performance overhead for more than 2000 tasks on a 10-node PowerLinux TM 7R2 system Finally with the help of S ONATA  we manage to sort 1TB data in 7 minutes on this system running IBM Platform Symphony TM  A CKNOWLEDGEMENT We would like to thank H Peter Hofstee and Jian Li for sharing the cluster with us We also would like to thank Zane Hu Alicia Chin and Yonggang Hu for providing product supports R EFERENCES  J Dean and S  Ghema w a t  Mapreduce si mpl i  ed dat a processing on large clusters in Proceedings of OSDIê04  2004 pp 137Ö150   Apache hadoop  h ttp hadoop apache or g  Cloudera enterprise core  h ttp://www  c loudera com/content cloudera/en/products/cloudera-enterprise-core.html 4  Ib m i n f o s p h e re b i g i n s ig h t s  h ttp www-0 1  ib m.co m software/data/infosphere/biginsights  Ibm platform symphon y   h ttp://www-03 ibm com/systems technicalcomputing/platformcomputing/products/symphony 6 K  K ambat l a  A  P at hak and H P ucha T o w ar ds opt i m i z i n g hadoop provisioning in the cloud in Proceedings of HotCloudê09  2009 7 H  H er odot ou H L i m G L uo N B o r i so v  L  Dong F  B  Cetin and S Babu Starìsh A self-tuning system for big data analytics in Proceedings of CIDRê11  2011 pp 261 272 8 Z  R en X Xu J  W an W  S hi  and M Z hou W or kl oad characterization on a production hadoop cluster A case study on taobao in Proceedings of IISWCê12  2012 pp 3Ö13 9 P  W  F r e y a nd G Al onso Mi ni mi zi ng t h e h i dden cost of rdma in Proceedings of ICDCS 09  2009 pp 553Ö560 10 Gan g lia mo n ito rin g s y stem  h ttp g an g lia.so u r cefo r g e n et  G Anant hanar ayanan S  Kandul a A Gr eenber g I  S t oi ca Y Lu B Saha and E Harris Reining in the outliers in mapreduce clusters using mantri in Proceedings of OSDIê10  2010 pp 1Ö16  J Dai  J Huang S  Huang B  Huang and Y  L i u Hi t une dataîow-based performance analysis for big data cloud in Proceedings of ATCê11  2011 pp 7Ö20  E  G a r duno S  P  K a vul ya J T an R  G andhi  a nd P Narasimhan Theia visual signatures for problem diagnosis in large hadoop clusters in Proceedings of LISAê12  2012 pp 33Ö42  Hadoop v a idya  h ttp://hadoop apache or g/docs/stable/v aidya html  N Khoussai no v a  M  B al azi nska and D  S uci u   P e r f xpl ai n debugging mapreduce job performance Proc VLDB Endow  vol 5 no 7 pp 598Ö609 2012 761
