Social Media, Social Influence, Cloud Computing, Tensor Factorization I INTRODUCTION 
In the recent years, Microblogging service has become an important social media for creating, sharing, or exchanging information and ideas. As for the 
Keywords 
Microblogging service platforms, the most popular are Twitter, Chinese Weibo, etc. These platforms allow user \(i.e Microblogger short messages \(also called microposts\to 140 characters to share with others what is happening, what is in teresting, as well as their feelings and opinions. For instance, when someone posts one micropost about the opinion of Iphone 5C in Sina Weibo platform, the readers of this micropost can interact with the 
Microblogger by writing comme nt, recommending to other Microbloggers by ç@é, or marking as positive. Through the interactions sharing opin ion about Iphone 5C between the Microblogger and its readers Microblogger could influence the shopping activities of read ers who may be latent customers of Iphone 5C. Therefore, the way in which people influence each other through their interactions is a

powerful but subtle pro cess that is pervasive in Microblogging service. Social influence analysis in social media often refers to verifying the existence of social influe or m easuring the stre ngth of di rect and  indirect influence between differ ent users It is oft en exploited for different tasks such as businesses intelligence   inform ation retrieval 2,3 10 com m e ndations 4,7,8,1 nion mi Consequently, there is a clear need for methods and techniques to mine social influence between Microbloggers with the emergence and rap id proliferation of Microblogs There has been some theoretical and empirical work on quantifying the strength of social influence in social media Typically, social influence study for estimating model on social media can be categorized in to roughly two types. The first is graph-based model, whe re the strength of social influence is learned from graph model which incorporates node information and interaction information. Tang et al  focused on measuring the strength of topic-level social influence quantitativ ely. They presented Topical Affinity Propagation \(TAP\odel th e topic-level social influence on large networks, and th en developed an efficient distributed learning algorithm for TAP based on the Map-Reduce framework in order to scale to real large networks. Agarwal et al. [8  ed pe rsonalize d  recommendation based a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-autho r interactions simultaneously in a principled way us ed on influe nce persona discovery and put forw ard an opinion-oriented link analysis model social influence analysis, wherein three kinds of influence persona are discovered. Yang et al examined the problem of predicting signed social ties and presented a Behavior Relation Interplay model that inferred signed ties by capturing the interplay between social relations and usersê behavior of decision making. Tan et al 1 dem onstra ted that use r le vel se ntim ent analysis can be significantly improved by inco rporating link information from a social network. They showed that us ing graphical models incorporating social network information could lead to statistically significant improvements in user-level sentiment polarity classification with respect to an approach using only textual informat ion. The second is matrix tensor factorization approac h, which means that matrix tensor is constructed to hold interaction information between Microblogger and its readers, and then matrix tensor factorization is empl oyed to quantify social influences. Hu et al of comments-oriented docume nt summarization by considering not only its content, but also the comments left by its readers. This work iden tified three relations \(namely topic, quotation, and mention\ by which comments can be linked to one another, modeled the relations in a 3rd-order tensor, and scored the importance of each comment by HOSVD and PARAFAC factorization. Chen et al focused on user reputation in a comment rating environment and estimated user reputation by a novel bias-smoothed tensor model which comb ined two types of reputation scores in a web system, external scores and internal scores Sun et exam ined the problem of personalized we b search and improved web search by  a novel CubeSVD approach where the clickthrough data was represented by a 3-order tensor \(users, queries and Web pages\nd the higher-order singular val ue decomposition technique was carried out to automatically capture the latent factors that govern the relations among these multi-type objects. Shi et al. [15 am e d to pN con tex t a w a r e r e commen d a tio n as a ranking problem in co llaborative Filtering and proposed TFMAP model using tensor fact orization to model implicit feedback data \(e.g. purchases clicks\contextual inform tackled the problem of social recommendation and presented a novel social recommendation framework fusing a user-item rating matrix with the userês social network using probabilistic matrix factorization. However, most these existing methods mostly rely on social links between users, failing to take advantage of significant cha racteristics of Microblogging Furthermore, Microbloggingês user si ze is very large, which make computing resource for social influence mining approach canêt be satisfied by single computer. On the other hand, with the exponential growt h of data in the amount of user-generated data, the MapReduce paradigm is employed to deal with data mining ap plications based on large-scale dataset, which provide good experience for tackling the huge volume of Microblogging dataset [17   In this paper, a tensor factorization framework based on cloud c omputing platform is put forward to estimate the strength of social influence in Microblogging. The framework has three components: a feature extraction component, a tensor factoriza tion component and a user influence ranking component. In feature extraction

In tensor factorization component tensor factorization based MapReduce model is presented to infer userês implicit userês relations. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component Moreover, the prediction accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach is expe rimentally evaluated by comparing with two baseline methods using Sina Weibo dataset \(Chinese Microblogging platform\In summary, the contributions of this paper are follows 1 002 The feature extraction on Microbloggers relations in Microblogging plat form is experimentally carried out for capturing user so cial influence quantitatively through statistical analysis  2 002 The proposed approach bases on Tensor factorization method which au tomatically estimates the latent factors that govern the Microbloggersê relations for the strength of social influence 3 002 The tensor factorization framework is developed on the Map-Reduce programming model in order to scale up the approach for tackling the huge volume of Microblogging dataset The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the features of Microblogging service are analyzed quantitatively for captur ing user social influe nce, and then a tensor factorization framework is put forward for mining social influence. Section III presents evaluation methodology and describes the experimental results in detail. Finally, our conclusion is summarized in Section IV We are given a Microbl ogging service platform Each Microblogger in and is interacted with other Microblogger  which leads to a set of relations s social influence in platform  and its relations  caused by its interactions with other Microbloggers, and then rank Mircoblogger according to its social influence score  Social influence could be inferred by automatically capturing the latent factors th at govern the relations between users in social me dia. In this section, a tensor-based approach is proposed to predict the strength of social influence using tensor factorization. For blogger media , according to [1 infl uential bl ogge rs a re not  necessarily active bloggers, and a blogger can be considered influential if s/he has at least one influential blog post which is be approximated by fou r properties: recognition, activity generation, novelty and eloquence  However, a microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically short snippets of text that provide any other content that can fit into 140 characters and the linkages between Microblogs are very sparse. Thus the strength of influential mi croblog could not be predicted by the four proposed blog properties. Hence, we have new general assumption for Mi croblogging platform. The influential microblog is sugge sted by the number of Microbloggers who forward the Microblog. The more Microbloggers forward a Micro blog, the more influential the Microblog gets  In this section, we firstly check the presented assumption using hypothesis testing method in feature extraction subsection. And then tensor factorization is employed to predict the late nt factors that govern the strength of Microblo gger social influence. Finally, social influence measurement function is introduced to rank the Microblogger according to the latent factors 002 A Microblog is often forwarded, commented, or thumbed up on Microblogging se rvice platform by its readers. And the influ ential strength of Microblog could be inferred through analyzing the activities of its readers. Since the Microblogês text is very short and the factor exerting the dissemination of the Microblogês influence is the forwarding activity, we assume that the number of Microbloggers who forward the Microblog is more essential then other factors to suggest the influence of the Microblog In order to verify the assumption, Hypothesis Testing experiment is performed using Chinese Weibo Dataset

Though the volume of Microbloggerês fans could not directly infer the influence of a microblog, it could also reflect the popularity of Microb logger. Therefore, we can rank the Microbloggers according to the volume of Microbloggerês fans, and split the whole dataset into two subsets by the Medians of the fansê volume. Therefore, we can rank the Microbloggers according to the volume of Microbloggerês fans, and split the whole dataset into two subsets by the Medians of the fansê volume. Obviously there exists significant difference on the influence between the two subsets. Hence, the statistic difference of the interacting activities between the two s ubsets can be used to prove the proposed assumption. Our assumption is reasonable if the forwarding activ ity has more significant difference than other interacting activities. Moreover, a rank correlation coefficient in statistics can measure the significance of the relation between two rankings. So, we can verify significant difference of the forwarding activity by comparing the rank correlation coefficients between three types of interacting activ ities and fans, respectively The Hypothesis Testing steps are the following 1 002 Sort Microbloggers by the volume of their fans and split Microbloggers da taset into two subsets according to the Medians of the fansê volume.

The computing results are given in Table 2 Obviously, the rank correlati on coefficient between the forwarding activity and fans is more significant than other interacting activities. Hence, our assumption is reasonable Table 2: Rank Correlation Coefficients Rank Correlation Coefficient Thumb-up Forwarding Comment Fan 0.4070363 0.4838018 0.3289258 002 The vector is often used for representation of text based on Bag-of-words m odel. Obviously, it has not enough space to hold interaction info rmation between Microbloggers Therefore, a tensor-based approach is proposed to model three types of objects: Microblogger Microblogger and activity. The forwarding activity data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which 3-mode factorization is employed to mine the latent factors that govern the interactions According to the latent factors, social influence function is developed to rank Microblogger  From the forwarding activity da ta, we can construct a 3-order tensor  represents that the Microblog  published by Microblogger is forwarded by Microblogger  Thus, according to [6 the value of is the central tensor where K is the dimension of the model latent factors be latent publisher, Microblog, and forwarder feature matrices, with column vector representing K-dimensional publisher specific latent feature vector of publisher column vector representing K-dimensional Microblog-specific latent feature vect or of Microblog  and column vector representing K-dimensional fo rwarder-specific latent feature vector of forwarder The goal of tensor factorization is to learn these latent variables and exploit them for social influence prediction Assuming that the forwarding counts of microblog  follow normal distribution \(i.e the tensor factorization is converted into a simpler optimization problem by maximum likeli hood estimation.

To address the challenge, we employ MapReduce model to develop distributed algorithm for deal ing with the task of calculating H matrix on a distributed system during the learning process MapReduce  is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. It takes a set of input key/value pairs, and produces a set of output key/value pairs. The user of MapReduce often expresses the computation as two functions: map and reduce.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no Chinese Microblogging service dataset for social influence analysis Therefore, we created a new Chinese Weibo dataset from Sina weibo service platform. The dataset consists of 2564 microblogs from 100 Microblogg ers during 2013-09-09 to 2013-09-15. And each Micro blogger published about 25 microblogs on average Firstly, we use the Root Mean Squared Error \(RMSE metrics to measure the prediction quality of our proposed approach in comparison with other matrix-based methods RMSE is defined as 2   is the predicted value for the original data Obviously, the smaller the metric the more precise the prediction result is Secondly, Precision at rank k \(P@k\is employed to evaluate the precision of our proposed approach. It is defined as the coincidence rate of the predicted ranking list and the ground truth ranking list for the top- k users     is the set of top-k users in the gold ranking list is the set of top-k users in the experimental ranking list In this section, in order to evalu ate the performance of our tensor factorization approach, we compare Tensor Factorization \(TF\with Matrix Factorization \(MF approach based on Chinese Weibo Dataset. Different numbers of latent feature is em ployed to test both of the approaches. The performance of RMSE with varying  values is shown in Figure 2. Compared with MF approach TF approach achieves consisten tly better performance with different number of latent feature  From Figure 2, as K increases, the RMSE also increases And the best RMSE of tensor factorization approach is achieved when K is set 2 Therefore, in the following experiments, we set 2   Fig 2: Performance Comparison on Different Values of are shown in Table 3.

The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, where it is observed that speed-up ratio is rising with the increasing of no des. In particular, time on twelve nodes cost more than that on two nodes when Microbloggersê size is 100. The reason is that when the cloud platform dealing with small amount of data, the cost of task scheduling an d network communication overhead outperforms the time saving from nodeês increments. However, with the increment of the data scale, the speedup shows reasonable parallel efficiency with 10 Fig 4: Speedup ratios on different scale data in cloud platform

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
