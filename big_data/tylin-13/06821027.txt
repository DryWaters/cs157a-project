A Prediction-Based Fault-Tolerant Aggregation Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks 
KeywordsÑtemporal-spatial correlation; data aggregation prediction; wireless sensor networks; fault-tolerant 
sensor nodes make data errorprone, thus affecting quality of the aggregation results. In this pap er we propose a prediction-based fault-tolerant aggregation algorithm, which is implemented on a constructed aggregation tree. Using temporal-spatial correlation between data, the algorithm can distinguish different data types And then we make a specific analysis of faulty data that may occur during data gathering and po intedly put forward different fault-tolerant solutions using the PSO-BPNN-based prediction model. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict data and excl ude the impact of faulty data ensuring real-time and fault-tolerant requirements I 
 
 I NTRODUCTION  A wireless sensor network \(WSN organizing network which can be deployed quickly It consists of a large number of sensor no des, which are low-power and have a short-distance communication capability. Each sensor periodically senses data and consum es most of energy to transmit and receive data. As a key technology in WSNs, data aggregation is a process deali ng with several data to obtain what data are more suitable for user needs, and it can not only reduce redundant data transmission, but also effectively im Howe ver, du e to unreliability and 
instability of wireless link between nodes and a variety of faults including hardware errors energy depletion and exception errors, nodes may become failure-prone, thereby reducing aggregation results accuracy. As an important indicator to evaluate network reliability, fault tolerance refers to the systemês ability to pr ovide correct results when networks fail. It is a prerequisite to guarantee that networks can keep normal operation, critical to the validity of aggregation Therefore, it is significant to explore how to increase fault tolerance of WSNs The authors propos ed DFDB W  based on the  weighted average method, DFDBW sets a credibility for each sensor node and synthetically judge whether a node has failed 
according to the average product of the measured value and credibility. Based on the weighted median method, authors in  fault-diagnosi s st rategy called WMFDS, which measures the gap between measured data to detect faults. It can be also applied to binary decisions and real measured values Above algorithms both provide high detection accuracy and lower misjudgment rate, but lack specific strategies for fault recovery Taking advantage of temporal-spa tial correlation between measured values, litera y excludes faulty data and uses the median measured values of neighbor nodes to estimate measured value of target, improving accuracy of target detection and location  a weighted factor for each sensor and uses the weighted average method to 
aggregate data. When a node fails or submits faulty data, this algorithm can adaptively reduce this nodeês weight, thereby reducing the impact of fau lty data on aggregation results to improve fault tolerance. But when failure rate stays high, above methods can not guarantee aggregation accuracy Based on the Dempster-Shafer \(DS the proposed a fault-tolerant interval fusion method. It can not only ensure smaller interval estimation, but also meet local Lipschitz condition in certain circumstances, making fused results satisfy the stability requirement Based on temporal-spatial fusion structure, liter posed a fault detection and recovery strategy. It detects faults in 
the fusion center, and then feeds the result back to local sensors by DS theory, effectively improving target classification accuracy. But the DS theory usually requires a large amount of computation, which is challenging for real-time demands The fault-tolerant aggregation al gorithm proposed in this paper includes construction of an aggregation tree, an anomaly detection mechanism and a fault-tolerant mechanism Construction of a di stributed aggregation tree is the basis of the algorithm, and then each node on the tree receives data from child nodes and sends them to its parent node after aggregation with its own Duri ng the process, temporal-spatial correlation is used to synthetic ally judge the validity and integrity of data, to effectively e 
liminate all kinds of possible faults. After that, to satisfy the real-time requirement of WSNs we use the PSO-BPNN-based pre diction model proposed in  predict d ata for fault tolerance The rest of this paper is org anized as follows: In section II the network model and envi ronmental assumptions are described in details, and th en we present our prediction-based fault-tolerant aggregation algorithm in section III. In section IV we compare our algorithm with other two algorithms and evaluate the performance of them Finally, concluding remarks are made in section V

A WSN can be modeled as an undirected graph     is a finite set of sensor nodes, and is defined as wireless links between nodes  000L 0003\0001 000L 0001\000R\000U\000P\000D\000O\000\003 0007\000U\000H\000H\000\003\0001\000R\000G\000H 000\\000X\000O\000W\000\003 0007\000U\000H\000H\000\003\0001\000R\000G\000H 0005\000R\000R\000W\000\003\000R\000U\000\003 000%\0006 000:\000L\000U\000H\000O\000H\000V\000V\000\003 000/\000L\000Q\000N  Figure 1  Due to continuity in time of physic al environment, single-node sampled data in the adjacent interval have a high correlation. In addition, due to high density of network topology, sampled data of neighbor sensors also have a high co  A fault is called if a sensor node doesnêt work properly because of equipment damage or energy depletion. This type of faulty data is easily considered as events, thus affecting the query results  A fault is called if a sensor node becomes low sensitivity because of outside interference. The frequency of occurrence of this type of faulty data is low and it can be easily ruled out The proposed algorithm in this paper is based on the following three environmental assumptions: \(1 node in WSNs can both sense data and aggregate data. \(2 Events are spatially correlated wh ile faults are not spatially correlated. \(3\ion algorithm always aggregates multiple copies of data into one copy and amount of each copy is equal Table 1 defines the symbols used in this paper TABLE I A  P REDICTION B ASED F AULT T OLERANT A GGREGATION A LGORITHM  The construction of a distribu ted aggregation tree aims to reduce redundant data transmission but the optimal solution is equivalent to solve the problem of Steiner minimum tree which is NP-complete. To facilitate discu ssion, here we will only take energy consumed for data communication into account and use the weighted average method to aggregate data. The energy models for transmitting data and receiving data can be respectively represented by formula \(1\ula \(2 1 2 where and are constants  and   ount transmitted from node to node So the energy consumption of each wireless link can be given by 3 From assumption \(1 know that the construction of an aggregation tree is to find a connected subgraph of  such that  4 From assumption \(3\ we can know Thus the prob lem \(4\be simplified to construct a minimum spanning tree, and the Prim al gorithm will be adopted to solve it In WSNs, nodal data include normal data and abnormal data, and abnormal data also include events and faults. It is fatal for WSNs to make the ri ght decisions how to effectively distinguish different data types Because sensed data and aggregated data share with the same detection mechanism, we will just discuss how to distinguish different sense d data types. According to the temporal correlation in Definition 1, the detection mechanism will use single-node historical data to determine whether data are abnormal. In general, within the range      is statistically continuous and admits a normal distribution   where and can be obtained from the known environmental param  S o the  expecte d val ue of sensed data can be represented as 5

The more nodes in detect abnormal data, the greater the probability that abnormal data is an event is. Here we assume that if the pro portion of nodes in which have detected abnormal data is greater than abnormal data are judged to be an event and immediately transmitted to the base station; otherwise, abnormal data are faulty data In order to better distinguish and a counter is introduced to record times that node has detected faulty data to determine failure types, and the process is described in algorithm 1 and are shown in figure 2\(b figure 2\(c Algorithm 1 Let each sensor node in figure 1 run the anomaly detection mechanism. When node communicates with if takes no notice of faulty data detected, its own data and data transmitted from nodes on the sub-trees will completely lose. Since traditional methods, such as reconstructing an aggregation tree discarding faulty data, data retran smission, adjusting weighting factors and so on, can not completely meet fault-tolerant requirements for different faulty data types in consideration of real-time and data validity, here we will combine them with the PSO-BPNN-based prediction model in  ulttolerant mechanism  000$\000G\000M\000X\000V\000W\000\003 000:\000H\000L\000J\000K\000W\000V 000$\000G\000M\000X\000V\000W\000\003 000:\000H\000L\000J\000K\000W\000V 000$\000G\000M\000X\000V\000W\000\003 0007\000K\000U\000H\000V\000K\000R\000O\000G\000V 000;\000\024 000;\000\025 000;\000\026 000,\000Q\000S\000X\000W\000\003\000/\000D\000\\\000H\000U 000+\000L\000G\000G\000H\000Q\000\003\000/\000D\000\\\000H\000U 0002\000X\000W\000S\000X\000W\000\003\000/\000D\000\\\000H\000U 0003\000D\000U\000W\000L\000F\000O\000H\000\003\0006\000Z\000D\000U\000P\000\003\0002\000S\000W\000L\000P\000L 000Q 0007\000U\000D\000L\000Q\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 0006\000H\000W 000$\000G\000M\000X\000V\000W\000\003 0007\000K\000U\000H\000V\000K\000R\000O\000G\000V 000'\000H\000Y\000L\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q  Figure 3  1.  while\( ReadData

The feed forward back propagation neural network \(BPNN is widely used to extract useful info rmation for samples. But its blindness of weights initialization easily results in slow convergence speed and stack into local infinitesimal value. The authors in [1 adopt particle swarm optim ization \(PSO  optimize initial weights and th reshold of BPNN to construct an energy-efficient prediction m odel, called PSO-BPNN, whose structure is shown in figure 3. The PSO-BPNN combines the fast constringency performance of BPNN with the global searching merit of PSO, aiming to finding out potential laws according to historical data to afterwards predict the test set The PSO-BPNN-based prediction m odel is run at both node  and node as shown in figure 4. Only when the deviation between the actual and the predicted value at the node exceeds a certain threshold, the samp ling value and new model parameters of node are sent to  As shown in figure 5, in this paper we consider fault tolerance for both sensed data and aggregated data and each node runs two mechanisms   Figure 5 or received data are faulty Thi t ion algorithms or data han e proposed algorithm is shown in any of the following three conditions 1\Sensed data of node are faulty.

rst 10 million tuples and after the load of the last batch of tuples The total number of tuples in the end is over 500 million The uniform samples are shown on the upper plots of Figure 4 and the last-seen weighted samples at the lower part The uniform sample always resembles the distribution of ra values found in PhotoObj after each append of the next 10 million tuples Thus at the end of the loading process the uniform samples is exactly like the one shown in the bottom plot of Figure 2 However at the start of the process the uniform sample resembles only the distribution of the ra values loaded up until that point For the last-seen weighted sample the story is different Given that this sample includes only the last 5000 tuples that have been appended and 5000 from the previous loads the resulting distribution is much different Notice that D is set to be equal to 10 million since that is the size of the batches of tuples that we append In the left lower plot of Figure 4 it is shown that although the weighted sample has a spike around the value 230 of ra  there are still some remaining tuples between 0 to 50 and 150 to 250 They are the remaining tuples of the previous appends That is since k  5000 and the size of the sample is s  10000  it follows that there should be about 5000 new tuples and 5000 older ones The plots of the last-seen weighted sample have similar properties for all the consecutive batch appends At the end the weighted sample only contains tuples from the last append as shown on the right lower plot of Figure 4 The spikes in the value distribution have moved to the values from the last tuples of the last batch VI C ONCLUSIONS Sampling is an important operation of a database system It is used for approximating query results for advising query planers and for maintaining indexes In this paper we propose a new use for sampling that of reìning a database into smaller parts called impressions  This reìnement allows faster evaluation of focused queries by examining only the relevant data For this we proposed weighted sampling as an alternative to uniform We have described three different families of weight functions To support our approach we analysed the data and query logs obtained by a realworld scientiìc application namely Skyserver Finally we have shown experimentally that weighted sampling is more suitable for
