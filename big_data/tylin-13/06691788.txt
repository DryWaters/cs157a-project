Optimizing Queries over Semantically Integrated Datasets on MapReduce Platforms HyeongSik Kim Kemafor Anyanwu Department of Computer Science North Carolina State University Raleigh NC USA  hkim22 kogan  ncsu.edu Abstract Life science databases generally consist of multiple heterogeneous datasets that have been integrated using complex ontologies Querying such databases typically involves complex graph patterns and evaluating such patterns poses challenges when MapReduce-based platforms are used to scale up processing translating to long execution work”ows with large amount of disk and network I/O costs In this poster we focus on optimizing UNION queries e.g unions of conjunctives for inference and present an algebraic interpretation of the query rewritings which are more amenable to ef“cient processing on MapReduce Keywords SPARQL Life Science MapReduce Union I I NTRODUCTION Life science databases actively adopt Semantic Web technologies to deal with the increasing number and complexity of datasets e.g Uniprot 1 is a central hub of functional information on proteins comprised of 16 sub datasets in RDF approx more than 1TB in N-triple Querying such datasets often brings challenges to optimization e.g a large number of multi-values in datasets and unbounded properties in queries In addition inferences are frequently involved as a part of query processing because a given semantic model may entail or imply data not explicitly stated While some data warehouses provide online SPARQL endpoints many of them do not fully handle such issues therefore users may want to explore the data by themselves but may not have the capabilities to process such large datasets A distributed data processing framework on cloud can be a good alternative on these issues e.g MapReduce allows programs to be automatically parallelized over arbitrarysized clusters of commodity-grade machines Most graph pattern matching processes can be encoded into MR jobs or expressed with the high-level data”ow query languages used in the extensions of the MapReduce framework such as Hive and Pig Supporting inference can also be achieved by materializing all entailed information and querying using regular methods since all information would then be explicitly represented in the data However this process will need to be repeated after each update to guarantee completeness and consistency A backward chaining with query re-writings can be used instead which generates unions of conjunctive queries UCQs in 2 This technique e xpands a triple pattern in a query to include all other possible alternatives guided by an ontology using UNIONs 1 http://beta.sparql.uniprot.org  Query w   TP STP Edges in STP S-O   O-O   Br in  UQ1 17 17 1 0 0 17 UQ2 51 20 3 0 0 17 UQ3 7 3 4:1 4:0 2 0 2 UQ4 24 12 2 0 0 12 UQ12 24 12 2 0 0 12 UQ18 10 5 2 5 0 6 Table I Characteristics of union queries For complex ontologies the number of the alternatives is large leading to UNION queries with a large number of branches Table I gives the characteristics of the example UNION queries provided by the Uniprot SPARQL endpoint page UQ3 and UQ18 are queries that explicitly contain a UNION clause while others are inference queries expanded to UCQs using the rewriting rules in UQ x  denotes the expanded query for UQ x  The ef“ciency of the evaluation of union queries on MapReduce-based platforms depends on the algebraic interpretation of the query In trivial cases e.g each UNION branch contains only a single triple pattern relationalstyle systems such as Hive detect the correlations across the UNION subqueries merging the execution of multiple branches into the single MR job However other complex queries are often translated into the long MR work”ows with a large number of joins Fig 1\(a shows the relationalstyle execution plan for the example query in Fig 1\(b using k MR jobs for k UNION branches and an additional job for the union of the output from the branches An optimization technique such as union pushdown might be applicable to relieve this issue However the translation of relational logical expressions to MapReduce data”ows might not always yield ef“cient execution work”ows and so still warrants further investigation II N ESTED T RIPLE G ROUP D ATA MODEL AND ITS A LGEBRA NTGA In some previous work we introduced an alternative data model and algebra called the Nested TripleGroup Data model and Algebra NTGA The intuition behind NTGA is to manage related sets of triples Our notion of relatedness here is a group of triples having the same subject or a Subject triplegroup which can be produced by a GROUP BY operation on the Subject column of the triple relation Such triplegroups can be considered candidate 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 5 


                      Figure 1 a A relational-style plan for b an example union query and c the corresponding NTGA-based plan matches to star subpatterns in a query if they contain at least one triple for each property in the star subpattern For example a triplegroup tg 1  TG  p 1 p 2  consisting of two triples whose properties are p 1 and p 2 can be a valid match to the graph pattern   s 1 p 1 o 1   s 1 p 2 o 2    If necessary we can produce an equivalent set of n-tuples from a triplegroup by splitting the triples in the triplegroup based on the property types and then applying a Cartesian product between the resulting subsets e.g tg.triples  p 1   tg.triples  p 2 where tg.triples  prop  is the set of triples in tg with property type prop  An advantage of the triplegroup model is conciseness of representation similar to the advantage of the nested relational model over the classic relational model Further the mapping of the NTGA logical plan to a MapReduce execution work”ow highlights its advantages when considering MapReduce platforms NTGA provides a set of logical operators to deal with triplegroups e.g TG_GroupBy  S  constructs labeled triplegroups by grouping the triples by the subject elds TG_GroupFilter    lters out triplegroups that do not contain matching subsets to any of the star subpatterns and TG_Join     joins triplegroups to support s-o/o-o joins In the rst MR cycle of the work”ow the operators   S  and   are executed which essentially lter out unnecessary triples and construct star-subgraphs triplegroups relevant to the query Additional MR cycles are then required to join star-subgraphs using     The maximum number of additional cycles will be n  where n is the  of star pattern subqueries In contrast using the relational-style interpretation of the queries generally requires 2 n  1 MR cycles Such shorter execution work”ows lead to bene“ts given that each MR incurs costs of expensive disk/network I/Os In this poster we explore the extension of NTGA to optimize UNION query processing We rst consider the case in which all k UNION subqueries contain a single star pattern as the only graph pattern Fig 1\(c shows that we include all the graph patterns in each UNION as parameters to    which evaluates multiple patterns concurrently in a single data pass or MR job For more complex cases each union branch can contain more than single star patterns which requires joins between star-subgraphs In this case we rewrite the UNION operators in the query expression to disjunctive ORs in the parameter of the operator     This is achieved by extending the parameter to accept more than one star patterns using the primitives similar to a logical OR    Figure 2 Execution time of union queries in Uniprot III E VALUATION The experiments were conducted on an 80-node Hadoop 0.20.2 clusters in VCL 2  NTGA was integrated into Pig 0.8.0 and a stable version of Hive 0.10.0 was selected as a benchmark target Each colored rectangle in the bars of the Fig 2 represents each MR job e.g Hive used 4 MR jobs for UQ3  In general Fig 2 shows that Hive plans performed worse than the NTGA one because the length of the MR execution work”ow depends on the size of rewritings in Hive i.e the width  of branches of the UNION clause For example the input les were read 12 times for UQ4 and UQ12 where each MR cycle was used to process each branch of the UNION Hive was unable to identify and exploit correlation across the UNION subqueries because they are not composed of single triple pattern The NTGA execution plan was able to merge all such correlated subqueries into a single execution cycle allowing input les to be scanned only once This allowed NTGA to outperform the Hive for the UNION queries with large widths   5  e.g NTGA was approximately 9 times faster than Hive for UQ12 in Fig 2 A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is partially funded by NSF grant IIS-1218277 R EFERENCES  G Gottlob G Orsi and A Pieris Ontological Queries Rewriting and Optimization in Proc ICDE  2011 pp 2…13  H Stuck enschmidt and J Broekstra T ime-Space T rade-of fs in Scaling up RDF Schema Reasoning in Proc WISE  2005 pp 172…181  J.-Y  Chang and S goo Lee An Optimization of Disjuncti v e Queries Union-Pushdown in Proc COMPSAC  1997 pp 356…361  P  Ra vindra H Kim and K An yanwu An Intermediate Algebra for Optimizing RDF Graph Pattern Matching on MapReduce in Proc ESWC  2011 pp 46…61 2 http://vcl.ncsu.edu 6

III.T HE F RAMEWORK O VERVIEW O F E CAD In this section, we will describe the motivation of our eCAD and overview the framework of our system In practice, we all know that virtualized resources of the same kind tend to have similar values on their QoS metrics. As an unsupervised method, clustering can automatically divide the samples into different categories based on the distance density and similarity between them. It has been widely used in the field of anomalies detection [8 En lig h t en e d by  th is w e  would take clustering as our basic approach. Compared with the traditional classification approaches, the clustering algorithm would not only identify the outliers with less prior knowledge, but also resist to the change of the cluster numbers Here, we use a simple example to illustrate our motivation Fig.1\(a\ presents a solution for anomalies detection problem with DBSCAN \(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise\, which is one of the density-based clustering algorithms. For it is only capable of recognizing the outliers separately at each monitoring period, we define it as a static clustering baseline algorithm in our paper However, as a result of the accumulated monitored data, the lower clustered resources would evolve over time. To this end we need to develop an evolutionary method to trace those transitions of virtualized resources, as shown in Fig.1\(b\We name it as the evolutionary clustering algorithm As mentioned by Ferretti et al [18 ou r eCA D fu n c tion i ng  as a middleware should comprise three main components monitoring composite, detection composite, and inference composite. Our eCAD is deployed in the middle of the cloud infrastructure and remote users, which can be seen in the Fig.2 To emphasize, we only focus on those anomalies that occur in virtual machines of the service level Physical level and service level are two abstract plains in the IaaS cloud. The basic physical devices are deployed in the lower layer of cloud, while the VMs virtual machines\provided to users outside the cloud lies in the service layer Monitoring composite collects the basic information such as the CPU and Memory usage, from the virtual nodes in the cloud. Some of them might be running in the kernel level, and some of them in the user level Detection composite is in charge of finding the anomaly nodes based on the information collected by the monitoring composite. The key algorithm used in this module is derived from the DBSCAN clustering which would be discussed in the following sections After the above two stages, inference composite sets off to explore the reasons for those anomaly nodes detected earlier In general, the real-time performance information generated in the physical and service level is intercepted by the monitoring composite. Then the detection composite use the evolutionary clustering algorithm proposed to perceive the anomalies among the VMs in the service layer, in order to avoid the SLO negotiated between the counterparts. At last, the inference composite utilize the algorithm based on the MNeighbors to present the reasons that might lead to violation IV E VOLUTIONARY C LUSTERING FOR A NOMALIES D ETECTION  In this section, we will first overview the framework of the current evolutionary clustering. After that, we propose an evolutionary approach with DBSCAN for cloud anomalies detection. Our method is considered to have a strong resistance to the noise and capable of finding anomalies in the cluster with arbitrary shapes. Besides, the algorithm for inferring the anomalies will be presented in the end The evolutionary framework of our research is primarily based on the following temporal smoothness penalty theory which was put forward by Chakrabarti [19  Its m a in i d e a ai m s  to add a constraint cost function to the traditional static clustering algorithms Here, we assume that and are respectively the evolutionary and static clustering results of virtualized nodes in cloud at time t. Given a time step t, the object of evolutionary clustering is to find the optimal that minimizes the cost function as follows denotes the current cost between evolutionary and statistic clustering results. Thus, the temporal function denotes the historical cost between time step and 1. Theoretically, we could use any continuous steps before time t to depict the temporal cost in  instead of only two steps. Moreover, as mentioned before, we could explain the above cost function either into the PQM framework or into the PCM framework [20  21

As a weight between the snapshot and temporal cost, the parameter alpha Equation \(1\can be set according to the status of the cloud environment. In particular, the evolutionary algorithms are regarded as an incremental clustering, when  equals to 0. Meanwhile, it turns out to be a static clustering when equals to 1. In addition to the linear combination above we might also use another non-linear weight to demonstrate the balance of cost between snap\(\ and temp In our context under the density-based evolutionary clustering with DBSCAN, we should redefine the snapshot and temporal function to illustrate the anomalies detection from an evolutionary view DBSCAN, which is short for the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, has become one of the classical algorithms for anomalies detection. It can not only identify the abnormal virtualized nodes, but also automatically distinguish those nodes into different clusters Core nodes, boundary nodes and anomaly nodes are three basic components in the DBSCAN. For a given virtualized node, it would become a core node, only if the number of its neighbors exceeds an upper threshold. On the contrary, those virtualized nodes within a limited distance are defined as the boundary nodes, which are mainly determined by the core nodes. Besides, the remaining nodes would become anomaly nodes, which usually take a minority of the dataset. Core nodes and their boundary nodes that could be directed within a limited distance are eventually divided into the same class Anomaly nodes would not belong to any class and thus should be regarded as outliers in the virtualized layer. As mentioned before, several researches have taken advantage of this method to accomplish the anomalies detection in cloud. However, they failed to take the transitions of those anomalies and its surrounding neighbors into consideration From the analysis above, we could infer that the cores nodes are determinant factors in the DBSCAN clustering According to it, we should trace the variation of the core nodes to precisely character the evolution for different clusters Nevertheless, we all know that the core nodes are determined by two main parameters and which are regularly settled on the basis of data density in DBSCAN clustering. To fully trace the variation, we could use the neighbor vector to represent the core nodes, which is defined as follows neighbors We formally define the vector as the number of neighbors for each virtualized node at time Meanwhile, the vector should be the number of neighbors for evolutionary clustering. It can be described as follows and represent the statistic number and evolutionary number of neighbors for virtualized node at time Here, we assume that the node number would not vary with time in our cloud environment Given a neighbor vector, we can quantify the temporal smoothness cost function into the following one  In such occasions, our goal is to find the optimal solution of above function for the evolutionary DBSCAN. Meanwhile, all the evolutionary approaches discussed in our context are derived under the PCM framework as mentioned before Based on the above observation, we could easily know that the value of is optimal only when the first-order derivative of the object function equals to zero. It can be seen as follows in the Equation \(4 In light of this, we can use the above neighbor vector to find the outliers in cloud at each time step. The details of our evolutionary clustering are described as follows The evolutionary clustering with DBSCAN above is presented under an ideal assumption that the number of virtualized nodes would not vary with the time.  Since the virtualized nodes are not always stable in the cloud, those anomaly nodes should be migrated or killed at a certain period There, we need to discuss the movement of such nodes Moreover, with the variation of cluster nodes, the configuration Evolutionary DBSCAN  set of virtulized noedes      and  anomalies at time    calculate evolutionary neighbor vector at time     label the nodes as core node     label the nodes as boundary node label the nodes as anomaly node

IMPLEMENTATION AND E XPERIMENT  In this section, we first introduce the basic environment and metrics in our context. Then we present the experiment evaluation results of our eCAD on the VICCI based test-bed under three different scenarios. Compared with the traditional static clustering for anomalies detection, our eCAD can performs much better  CPU-oriented us / sy / id / wa Memory-oriented swpd / free/ buff / cache IO-oriented bi / bo / si / so Process-oriented b / r / in / cs 
 
 
of parameters, such as the and is also needed to be tuned, which is beyond the scope of our paper In terms of the removal and entrance of the cluster nodes our evolutionary framework can easily deal with these conditions. To begin with, we could neglect the neighbor vectors of those removed anomaly nodes in the subsequent intervals, which can be done by deleting a row in the vector  At the same time, we could initial the neighbor vectors of these new comer nodes as zeros, which can be done by adding a row to the vector Since the derived neighbor vectors for the evolutionary clustering is a linear combination of the snapshot cost and temporal cost, the removal and entrance of the virtualized nodes at any time step would naturally not affect the evolution process In order to make adjustments in time, our eCAD also needs to undertake the anomaly inference afterwards. Since the anomalies in our framework are mainly determined by the MINPTS nodes within the EPS, we suggest using the distance or similarity of the nearest MINPTS nodes to infer between different attributes, which is defined as the M-Nearest Neighbors \(MNN\gorithm for inference in our paper Besides, we only focus on the categories of those anomalies rather than their specific attributes. For example, the attributes contained in the memory-oriented category might include memory usage, virtual memory usage and so on. The pseudocode is described as follows V The prototype of our eCAD is established on the top the VICCI, which is promoted by researchers from the PlanetLab programs. As a kind of federated cloud, the VICCI platform consists of distributed cluster servers in the Princeton University, Stanford University, Washington University and other seven institutions. Similar to the other IaaS clouds, it can provide the VMs for users outside the cloud In our experiment, we use the HADOOP WORDCOUNT AND SORTED programs as our benchmark. All of the scenarios are hence running under the HADOOP framework In order to obtain the monitored information, we also install the VMSTAT tool in each VM. The detailed representative symbol of each metric could be found in the Table I In our experiment, we simulate three different scenarios with injected CPU errors to evaluate our eCAD. It can be seen as follows The eCAD was deployed on the 180 virtual nodes, where the HADOOP WORDCOUNT benchmark ran. Under such a situation, the virtual nodes were in single HADOOP mode and independent with each other Besides, all the clusters as well as the anomalies are labeled based on the injected CPU errors The eCAD was deployed on the 50 virtual nodes with distributed HADOOP mode. Different from the above NoHead Scenario, the SORTED benchmark was adopted in this situation This scenario took on the same configuration as Head Scenario. Nevertheless, we labeled the anomalies on account of the OUTPUT/INPUT rate in the service level, so as to investigate the effects of anomalies on the SLO To evaluate our approaches, we employ three indexes including Precision, Recall and F-Score, which are the popular evaluation approaches in field of machine learning. The details of each index are introduced as follows.

   D Results Before conducting our evaluation, we need to select the parameters in our evolutionary algorithm. According to distance trend of the nearest K-neighbors, we theoretically set EPS=10, MINPTS=3\n scenario 1 and \(EPS=10 MINPTS=4\ the other two scenarios Since each alpha indicates a different strategy, Fig.3 presents the impact of alpha on our eCAD. As mentioned before, our evolutionary approach would be a static clustering when the parameter alpha is equal to 1, while it would become an incremental algorithm when the alpha is 0. As seen from the Fig.3, the static clustering showed the poorest performance in cloud anomalies detection. When the alpha equals to 0.1 the eCAD can obtain the highest precision in our experiment scenarios In terms of the anomalies detection with evolutionary time steps, we can find that our eCAD framework exceeds its counterparts in Fig.4. At the beginning of our simulated experiments, the eCAD with evolutionary approaches takes an advantage. When the CPU errors are injected, it starts to fall down and returns to a stable status later on. Under that condition where the alpha equals to 0.25, the eCAD achieves its highest performance To emphasize it, the static strategy always stayed in an unstable drift, fluctuating up and down with time stepping Besides, the over-all results shown in the scenario 2 and scenario 3 resembles with each other. To some extent, we justify that the upper SLO values can reflect statuses of the lower virtual resources, and could also help to label those anomalies After detection, we utilize the proposed MNN algorithm to infer the reason that leads to anomalies. In our experiment, we regarded the CPU errors as our incentives. The inference results can be found in Table II

occasion, the labels were determined based on the upper SLO Thus, other attributes might interfere with its precision. We would improve it in the future works VI C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a framework named eCAD from an evolutionary view to identify anomalies in the IaaS cloud. To illustrate our framework, we established a VICCI cloud equipped with HADOOP benchmarks. Our experiment reveals that the evolutionary clustering method can identify cloud anomalies more precisely than its counterparts especially for the traditional static clustering approach Moreover, our framework can also infer the reasons for the above anomalies As immediate future work, we plan to simulate more scenarios with other injected errors. With the accumulation of the anomalies, they might come into being a whole anomaly cluster, which would also be solved within our following researches R EFERENCES  1
