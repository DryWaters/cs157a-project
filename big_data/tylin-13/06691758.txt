Content-based Assessment of the Credibility of Online Healthcare Information Meeyoung Park Hariprasad Sampathkumar Bo Luo Electrical Engineering and Computer science University of Kansas Lawrence U.S.A  mpark hariprsd bluo  ku.edu Xue-wen Chen Computer Science Wayne State University Detroit U.S.A xwchen@wayne.edu Abstract Currently a large amount of data is produced in healthcare informatics due to the growth of web technologies like social networks wikis blogs and RSS feeds However not all health information provided online is trustworthy Even though many experts are involved in publishing trusted information it is difìcult for the general population to determine the credibility of the information Therefore a reliable mechanism to automatically determine the trustworthiness of online healthcare information is highly desired In this paper we propose two novel approaches based on Topic Modeling and Hidden Markov Models HMMs that can be applied over a large volume of online healthcare data to assess its trustworthiness Traditional Topic Modeling is solely based on the bag-of-words model however we also consider the semantics of the content to identify the underlying topics in a sentence For the HMM approach we built our trustworthy and suspicious models after analyzing the characteristics of sentences from such websites Both methods perform well to assess the trustworthiness however HMM is less sophisticated to capture the semantics of sentences We evaluated our method on randomly chosen real dataset and are able to achieve about 90 accuracy in identifying the trustworthiness of the content Keywords Healthcare Informatics Big Data Hidden Markov Model Topic Discovery I I NTRODUCTION Robinson et al deìned Interactive Health Communication IHC as the interaction of an individualconsumer patient caregiver or professional with or through an electronic device or communication technology to access or transmit health information or to receive guidance and support on a health-related issue In the US 66 of healthy adults and 51 of patients were found to be looking for the health information online as of 2010 As IHC has become essential in daily life medical researchers are paying more attention to the importance of the quality of healthcare information that is available online 4 5 With the rapid growth of Web 2.0 and social networks like Facebook and Twitter the amount of healthcare information available online has ampliìed tremendously In order to seek health information consumers make use of portal sites or search engines like Google The importance of search engines in accessing healthcare information has been discussed well in the past studies Berland et al sho wed that of the results displayed in the rst page only 20 included relevant content less than 50 of the clinical elements were accurate while 24 of the content of the search engine results were not covered Peterson et al also showed that most users preferred the rst page results returned by the search engines However most search engines which return pages based on the userês search keywords make use of link analysis algorithms like PageRank or HITS which only use the link structure and number of incoming and outgoing links to score the pages 10 W ith no w a y t o score based on the trustworthiness of the content the veracity of the healthcare information returned by such search engines becomes highly questionable Furthermore it is possible to create crediblelooking scientiìc websites with spurious information and have them be highly ranked in search engine results There have been several studies conducted by medical experts in order to assess the quality of healthcare information available on the internet which have shown the information to be not trustworthy 12 13 14 Meric et al used the keywords breast cancer on Google and examined the rst 200 websites of over 10,000 English sites manually They evaluated the characteristics of the websites and found that only 57 of the web pages had author information with the rest of them having partial or no information In addition the study also conìrmed that the quality of the information had no correlation with link popularity Jonathan et al conducted a user study to identify the reliability of the search engine results and asked experts to judge the trustworthiness of the top 20 results returned from the commercial search engine Google for 10 healthcare related queries The e xperts e v aluation identiìed 51 of the sites to be credible 45 of the sites to be suspicious and the remaining 4 to be irrelevant The study clearly highlights that search engines do not use trustworthiness of content in their scoring mechanism Such a mixture of results leads to misinformation and confusion among users Even though credible websites like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC or the National Institute of Health NIH guarantee the trustworthiness of healthcare information they provide their use of medical terminology can sometimes be hard for users to understand Users may 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE

tend to prefer more explanatory sites such as Wikipedia a free editable online encyclopedia Furthermore Google often returns Wikipedia pages as the rst page in its search results Recently a small-scale study conducted by Leithner et al examined the quality of the Wikipedia articles relating to Osteosarcoma in comparison to the ones a v ailable in National Cancer Institute NCI They observed the quality of the Wikipedia articles to be good and more accessible than the NCI articles but found them to lack scientiìc citations Apart from the quality of health information available in search engine results and Wikipedia we also need to consider the quality of information available in social networks Since more and more people are engaged in their use their content also plays an important role in the dissemination of health information among general consumers Weitzman et al conducted a study to observe the quality and safety of diabetes-related social networks The y reported the quality to be variable but found security and privacy of userês personal data to be poor Although the study was conducted on a small scale it is enough to show that social networks inevitably contain suspicious healthcare information In order to address these issues we need new automated approaches for a scientiìc and objective measurement of trustworthiness of healthcare information Natural Language Processing NLP and Machine Learning ML are now essential techniques to process text data in medical informatics 19 20 In this study  w e propose a content-based analysis using the above techniques to analyze healthcare text data on the web and assess its credibility Our proposed method is inspired by an observation websites whose content are similar to trusted websites are also more likely to be trustworthy Therefore our approach tries to identify similarities in website content in comparison to content from known websites To do this we rst gather healthcare related pages from the internet using a focused crawler We then use two methods HMM based sentence models to identify the trustworthiness of healthcare information and a Bag-of-words based Topic Discovery method to identify topics within the sentences of those pages We then perform page-level and site-level classiìcations based on results from both these methods to identify the trustworthy and suspicious sites We evaluated our method on randomly chosen real dataset and are able to achieve about 90 accuracy in identifying the trustworthiness of the content Our contributions in this paper are primarily three fold 1 We have proposed two novel approaches for performing content based analysis on healthcare data 2 We have been able to show that the Topic Modeling approach is able to perform better than the HMM approach due to its ability to effectively capture semantic information and 3 the proposed algorithm for performing content analysis scales linearly making it suitable for handling big data II P RELIMINARIES We used two approaches for our content-based analysis on healthcare data Hidden Markov Model and TAGME A Hidden Markov Model A Hidden Markov model HMM is a statistical model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with hidden states Primarily HMMs have been used to model sequence data like speech utterances in speech recognition The y h a v e also been used in P artof-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition 25 tasks The success of HMMs in identifying patterns in sequential data has motivated us to explore the possibility of using HMM for content-based analysis In general a HMM can be deìned using the following parameters  Notation and deìnition N  Number of states in the HMM M  Number of observation symbols in the HMM A  a ij   N by N state transition probability matrix B  b j  m   N by M observation probability matrix   i   N by 1 initial state probability vector An HMM is used to model a sequence with hidden states that represent the latent characteristics of the pattern that we are trying to model which however emit symbols or observations that are visible The outputs of the hidden states are observable and are represented as probabilistic functions of the state In case of sentence modeling the hidden states would represent the characteristics of a sentence while the words forming the sentence would represent the visible observations HMM is a supervised learning method where a training set is used to train the model The Baum Welch algorithm is used for this and it learns the transition and observation probabilities of the HMM Once trained the HMM can then be used for computing the probability of a sentence belonging to given model using the ForwardBackward algorithm or can be used to predict the possible hidden state sequence that could have generated a given sequence of observations using the Viterbi algorithm B Short-Text Tagging Traditional topic modeling methods use probabilistic approaches based on bag-of-words model Ho we v e r  the bag-of-words approach is solely based on the frequency of terms in a document therefore it is hard to capture the semantics of the text In order to overcome the problem Latent Semantic Analysis LSA Explicit Semantic Analysis ESA or Kno wledgebase approaches 29 ha v e been proposed Recently with the rapid growth of Wikipediaês knowledgebase and its link structure connecting the related concepts efìciently several ESA based approaches using Wikipedia have been studied 31 32 One of the 52 


ESA methods is TAGME which is a web application tool for identifying underlying topics in short text fragments using Wikipedia and its link structure proposed by Ferragina and Scaiella http://tagme.di.unipi.it The y impro v e d their method based on the studies of Kulkarni et al and Cucerzan to deal with annotating very short texts or fragments such as tweets or news feed items on-the-îy  32 Given the set of anchor texts A  X  identiìed from a block of text X  the score for a particular sense p x for the anchor text x to be associated with the page p is determined through a vote of all other anchor texts y which are in support of the annotation x link    p  Since the anchor text y can also have many senses the vote is computed as the average relatedness for each sense p y of the anchor y in relation to the sense p x  Since not all senses of y have the same statistical signiìcance the contribution of p y is weighted using its commonness or prior probability Pr  p y  y   Thus the voting formula is deìned as vote y  p x   p y  G  y  rel  p y p x  Pr  p y  y    G  y   1 where rel  a b  is a measure of relatedness between two pages a and b based on the overlap between their in-linking pages in Wikipedia The relatedness score makes sure that only the senses p y that are related to p x affect the voting measure The nal score that deìnes the goodness of the annotation x link    p is obtained by the sum of the votes of all other possible anchors y in the text T  The set of candidate anchors identiìed from the disambiguation phase are then passed through a pruning phase to discard possibly meaningless anchors These bad anchors are identiìed based on the link probability of an anchor and the coherence of its candidate annotation which is computed as the average relatedness between the candidate sense of an anchor and the candidate senses for all other anchors in the given text Only anchors with high link probability or whose assigned sense is coherent with the senses to other anchors are retained III METHOD In this section we propose two novel approaches based on topic modeling and machine learning techniques to assess the trustworthiness of the information provided in healthcare sites by doing content-based analysis automatically For the topic modeling approach we make use of TAGME to identify salient topics in the sentences available in the healthcare websites An analysis of the similarity measures among the topics identiìed is used to decide if the information from candidate website falls under the suspicious or trustworthy category For the machine learning approach we apply Hidden Markov Models to model trustworthy and suspicious sentences using an annotated training set A Data Collection We gathered our dataset using a special healthcare focused crawler we used manually curated trustworthy and suspicious pages as the seed to crawl other websites We used a heuristic based on weighted term frequencies of approximately 150 healthcare related keywords to control the crawling of the websites and stopped crawling if the initial few pages of a website fall below a certain threshold value of this heuristic Overall we have collected 316 thousand 316K web pages from 39,831 domains Though a lot of healthcare related information is present in social networking sites we consider such information to be highly inconsistent in quality and hence exclude a total of 187 major active social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter from our list of crawled websites B HMM Analysis In this approach we create two separate HMMs one to model the suspicious sentences and the other to model trustworthy sentences  Once these HMMs are trained the probability of any new sentence belonging to both the models is determined The sentence is then classiìed to belong to a model which has the highest probability value We make use of the Stanford NLP tagger to identify PartOf-Speech tags in sentences which then help in identifying the features of trustworthy and suspicious sentences 1 Trustworthy Sentence Model We chose a few seed websites from the collection of trustworthy sites and analyzed the sentences manually to identify features that can be used to model a trustworthy sentence Most of the sentences that provide credible information often tend to be expressed in passive voice which can be detected in general by the presence of the Noun-Verb-Noun format where the rst noun is the Object and the second is the Subject  In case of passive voice the verb forms used tend to be either a be form verb a have form verb or a past tense verb while the nouns are proper nouns gerunds and nouns in singular or plural forms These features are used to form the states of a trustworthy sentence HMM  Proper Noun PRN names of places things etc  Be Form Verb BFV be am is are was were been being  Have Form Verb HFV have has had having  Past Tense Verb PTV  Gerund GER  Participle Verb PAV past or present participle verb  Other Noun OTN nouns other than proper nouns  Other words OTH words not in the above categories 2 Suspicious Sentence Model In general sentences from suspicious websites 1 try to promote or sell a particular product 2 provide instructions for the reader to follow 3 tend to resort to superlatives in order to sell the products or services 4 contain commercial terms to sell a service or product 5 contain suspicious words or content that appear to promise a guaranteed solution with no scientiìc proofs 6 usually end with an exclamation mark So the above 53

page Since each page contains representative topics we can compare the similarities with each other For calculating page-level similarity we use the most popular set-similarity method called Jaccard similarity and it can be obtained by PageSim  x i y i  T otal number of same topics  T otal number of topics 2 where x i and y i are pages from each website Based on this we can calculate the page-level similarity score between pages 2 Site-Level Similarity Next in order to get the sitelevel similarity we adopted Group Linkage problem Group Linkage problem is used to identify the similarity between two groups which have different number of elements The fundamental idea of the group linkage is based on Maximum Bipartite Matching\(MBM problem The deìnition of MBM similarity is deìned as below Let A and B be two sets A  a 1 a 2   a m and B  b 1 b 2   b n  The Maximum Bipartite Matching Similarity MBM Sim  is deìned as MBM Sim  A B    a i b j   M sim  a i b j  m  n  M 3 where sim  a i b j    is the similarity of two elements in the two groups A and B M is the number of maximum weight matching in the bipartite graph In our approach sim  a i b j  would be the page-level similarity above   The threshold  is to remove the pages having very low similarity scores and can be decided heuristically Using MBM Sim we get the similarity score between two web sites Finally in order to evaluate the trustworthiness of unknown site X  we deìned the ContentSim X  as below ContentSim  X  Sum of Top 5 Site  Level  Similarity of T rustworthy Sites    Sum of Top 5 Site  Level  Similarity of Suspicious Sites  4 The content similarity of site X ContentSim\(X is the difference between the summation of top 5 site-levelsimilarity from trustworthy group and the summation of top 5 site-level-similarity from suspicious sites If the value of ContentSim score is positive we consider that site X contains trustworthy informatio If not it contains suspicious information IV R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION Since we have a big data set approximately 316 thousand web pages from 39,831 domains it is not possible to evaluate all of them without manually classifying each of them as well Therefore we experiment on this big data set by randomly picking a few sites manually to evaluate the accuracy of our approach A Results of HMM Analysis 1 Page-level classiìcation Sentence level classiìcation is carried out for all sentences in all the pages belonging to those selected sites The page level features as mentioned before are extracted for all the pages The extracted page level features from the training and testing data set are used for building the SVM page classiìer The average of classiìcation accuracy for the pages in the testing set is over 95  for suspicious sites and 94 for trustworthy sites Website Total pages Classiìcation Accuracy Website of trustworthy pages classiìcation ChooseMyPlate 200 48.5 Suspicious clinicaltrials 200 98.0 Trustworthy dana-farber 198 74.24 Trustworthy diabetes 193 11.40 Suspicious drugabuse 200 48.5 Suspicious foodsafety 50 66.0 Trustworthy hhs 310 68.71 Trustworthy kidshealth 187 44.39 Suspicious letsmove 127 46.46 Suspicious mayoclinic 294 38.10 Suspicious nemours 200 81.0 Trustworthy nutrition 69 31.88 Suspicious usa 103 48.54 Suspicious webmd 198 13.64 Suspicious womenshealth 166 53.61 Trustworthy Table I Page Classiìcation on Real Data Set for Trustworthy Sites Website Total pages Classiìcation Accuracy Website of Suspicious pages classiìcation blogtalkradio 200 68.0 Suspicious comcblog 309 61.49 Suspicious devinalexander 168 85.12 Suspicious directselling411 203 49.75 Trustworthy discovergoodnutrition 192 80.21 Suspicious ite 233 55.36 Suspicious goodhousekeeping 196 95.92 Suspicious losethebellyfatnow 154 72.73 Suspicious ocregister 189 48.68 Trustworthy planetarynutrition 200 12.0 Trustworthy plentyofhealth 201 84.58 Suspicious premadeniches 175 88.0 Suspicious wholefoodsmarket 199 97.49 Suspicious widgetbox 478 85.36 Suspicious zendesk 198 87.88 Suspicious Table II Page Classiìcation on Real Data Set for Suspicious Sites 2 Site-level Classiìcation Table III presents the website classiìcation accuracy which is based of the results obtained from the SVM based page classiìcation approach which are presented in Tables I and II It can be seen that for the pagelevel classiìcation on the 15 real dataset for trustworthy sites the average classiìcation accuracy is only 40 Since the SVM Page classiìcation is based on the underlying HMM based sentence classiìcation this lower performance can be attributed to the HMM classiìerês inability to identify trustworthy sentences in comparison to suspicious sentences B Results of Topic Analysis The Topic Discovery method needs a reference dataset for the trustworthiness assessment of unknown sites We 55

reference set Even though trustworthiness is subjective we choose government sites as our reference set as we believe them to contain truthful information and hence use them to represent trustworthiness objectively As seen in Table IV the content similarities are all positive showing that the government sites share more similar semantic topics with each other than the suspicious sites However unexpectedly NIH shows very low content similarity value We can probably attribute this to the notion that content available in NIH tends to be more scientiìc in nature in comparison to other

methods with real dataset D Discussion Our proposed content-based analysis approaches are alternative ways for overcoming the traditional link analysis approaches that are used for assessing the semantics of the web page contents Especially Topic Analysis based on ESA works well due to the vast information provided by Wikipedia In our Topic Analysis method the important thing to consider is a way to scale up the number of seed sets used for the trustworthy and suspicious reference sites Since the small number of seed sets hardly represent the volume of the big data we need to scale them up efìciently We can use automatic expansion methods to include more seed sites without any bias of content We can use an automatedannotating scheme based on trained HMMs to do this The results of HMM Analysis shows that it is difìcult to identify content that is truly trustworthy The HMM is solely based on certain Part-of-Speech patterns and word sequences which does not take into account the semantics of the content In addition our trustworthy sentence model was built primarily based on content from trusted scientiìc sites It is difìcult to model a generic sentence that contains trustworthy content without also performing some kind of semantic analysis Therefore using only some surface level patterns in the sentences is not sufìcient for content-based analysis The Topic Analysis method though fundamentally based on the bag-of-words model approach still seems to perform better than the HMMs due to its ability to identify semantically salient topics for given content 56 


We collected 316 thousand 316K webpages from 39,831 domains however we only used randomly selected websites for testing our approaches due to the labor intensive process to label all of them For addressing the needs of big data  the critical factor to consider is the speed and efìciency of the algorithms used to implement the proposed approaches Our Topic Analysis method has a runtime complexity of only big-O of  N  where N is the number of web pages Due to this linear complexity this approach can be easily scaled to work in real-time even with large volume of data Case Study Among the websites we tested we chose a suspicious website to look into the trustworthiness of its contents We chose www.discovergoodnutrition.com which provides nutrition and health advice to users The website as such is well designed so many users might tend to trust the information they provide However if we take a look at their advice pages we nd that they provide information without any scientiìc citations For example one page talks about bacteria which are known to help in digestion and promotes consumption of Yogurt containing such bacteria However there are no supporting evidences or links to scientiìc studies that describe the role of the bacteria and how it is beneìcial to our health Our method was able to predict this site as suspicious even though the site itself looks trustworthy at a glance V C ONCLUSION Healthcare Informatics is a promising eld to utilize the blood of healthcare related data through adoption of information technologies Currently a large amount of data is generated in this area due to web technologies like social networks wikis blogs and RSS feeds However not all health information provided online is trustworthy Even though many experts are involved in publishing trusted information it is difìcult for people to determine the credibility of the information Most search engines have the ability to control spam pages but cannot determine the trustworthiness of the page yet and it is not easy for users to distinguish trustworthy sites from the mixed results Hence identifying the credible information on the complicated web society is a challenging problem Therefore a reliable mechanism to automatically determine the trustworthiness of online healthcare information is highly desired In this paper we propose a novel approach over a large volume of online healthcare information collected by a focused crawler We have tried to measure the trustworthiness of the information based on content-based analysis Since due to the ambiguity and language speciìc characteristics of the content analysis NLP and ML have been used often in medical and healthcare informatics We applied TAGME and HMM among many methods in NLP and ML to analyze healthcare text data on the web and assess its credibility Our proposed method is inspired by an observation websites whose content and opinions are similar to trusted websites are more likely to be trustworthy Our approach consists of three steps rst we preprocessed the dataset gathering healthcare related pages from the internet using a focused crawler We then built HMMs to identify the trustworthiness of healthcare information HMM Analysis Finally we identiìed topics within the sentences of those pages based on the bag-of-words model Topic Discovery In HMM analysis we did page-level classiìcation using SVM and majority voting on site-level to identify the trustworthy and suspicious sites We also measured the page-level and sitelevel similarity between credible and suspicious contents for topic discovery Both methods perform well to assess the trustworthiness however HMM is less sophisticated in capturing the semantics of sentences We evaluated our method on randomly chosen real dataset and are able to achieve about 90 accuracy in assessing the trustworthiness of the content R EFERENCES  T  N Robinson K P atrick T  R Eng D Gustafson et al  An evidence-based

              0 50 100 150 200 250 300 ParaLite Hive ParaLite Hive ParaLite Hive Elapse Time\(second 20 50 80 Recovery Normal Fig 11 The slowdown of Query 5 with ParaLite and Hive The results are shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a similar effectiveness R EFERENCES  D DeW itt and J Gray   P arallel Database Systems the Future of Highperformance Database Systems Commun  vol 35 no 6 pp 85Ö98 1992  J Dean and S Ghema w at MapReduce

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
