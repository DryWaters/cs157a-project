Random Access Congestion Control in DVB-RCS2 Interactive Satellite Terminals Alessio Meloni and Maurizio Murroni DIEE Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering University of Cagliari Piazza D'Armi 09123 Cagliari Italy Email f alessio.meloni gf murroni g diee.unica.it Abstract The next generation of interactive satellite terminals is going to play a crucial role in the future of DVB standards As a matter of fact in the current standard satellite terminals are expected to be interactive thus offering apart from the possibility of logon signalling and control signalling also data transmission in the return channel with satisfying quality Considering the nature of the traf®c from terminals that is by nature bursty and with big periods of inactivity the use of a Random Access technique could be preferred In this paper Random Access congestion control in DVB-RCS2 is considered with particular regard to the recently introduced Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha technique able to boost the performance compared to Slotted Aloha The paper analyzes the stability of such a channel with particular emphasis on the design and on limit control procedures that can be applied in order to ensure stability of the channel even in presence of possible instability due to statistical uctuations Index Terms Transmission Simulation Channel Modeling Congestion Control I I NTRODUCTION In consumer type of interactive satellite terminals users generate a large amount of low duty cycle and bursty traf®c with frequent periods of inactivity in the return link Under these operating conditions the traditionally used Demand Assignment Multiple Access DAMA satellite protocol does not perform optimally since the response time for the transmission of short bursts can be too long For this reason in the recently released speci®cation for the next generation of Interactive Satellite Systems DVB-RCS2 the possibility of sending logon control and even user traf®c using Random Access RA in timeslots speci®ed by the Network Control Center NCC is provided to Return Channel Satellite Terminals RCST In particular two methods are considered for RA the rst one is the well known Slotted Aloha SA 3 the second is called Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha CRDSA  6 SA represents a well established RA technique for satellite networks in which users send their bursts within slots in a distributed manner i.e without any central entity coordinating transmission While this allows to reach an average throughput around 0  36  packets=slot  despite the possibility of collision among bursts from different users SA works A Meloni gratefully acknowledges Sardinia Regional Government for the nancial support of his PhD scholarship P.O.R Sardegna F.S.E 2007-2013 Axis IV Human Resources Objective l.3 Line of Activity l.3.1 with very moderate channel load to ensure acceptable delay and loss probability This gap has been recently lled with the introduction of a new technique named CRDSA that is able to boost the throughput even up to values close to 1  This technique is based on the transmission of a chosen number of replicas for each burst payload similarly to what is done in Diversity Slotted Aloha DSA Burst copies are randomly placed within a certain number of slots grouped in a so called frame However differently from DSA in CRDSA each burst copy has a pointer to the location of the other replicas of the same burst payload Therefore when the frame arrives at the receiver an interference cancellation IC process is accomplished The IC process consists in removing the interfering content of already decoded bursts from the remaining slots in which collision occurred in order to try restoring the content of bursts that had all their replicas colliding from which its name In particular speci®es tw o possible variants of CRDSA  Constant Replication Ratio CRDSA CR-CRDSA using a constant number of replicas for each burst  Variable Replication Ratio CRDSA VR-CRDSA using a number of replicas that can differ among packets since the number of replicas is determined according to a prede®ned probability distribution Document also claims that the applications using the interactive network may rely on network internal contention control mechanisms to avoid sustained excessive packet loss resulting from simultaneous destructive transmissions but the de®nition of such a mechanism is claimed to be out of scope for the document For this reason in this paper guidelines for the design of such a system having simple yet effective retransmission policies aiming at avoiding congestion at the gateway when using RA in the next generation of satellite terminals are presented To do so we rely on the analysis carried out in in which a stability model for the case of CRDSA with geometrically distributed retransmissions was presented The analysis carried out in is based on the de®nition of Equilibrium Contour and Channel Load Line  similarly to what was done in for SA The Equilibrium Contour represents a set of circumstances for which the ongoing communication is in equilibrium in the sense that the number of newly transmitted packets is equal to the 


number of packets successfully sent so that the total number of packets queuing for retransmission do not change The Channel Load Line completes the analysis telling which of these equilibrium points are actually of equilibrium for a given scenario depending on the user population and on the probability that a user has a new packet to transmit Based on this model it is possible to understand where this points of equilibrium for the ongoing communication are with respect to the throughput For this reason this paper discusses parameter settings able to ensure that the communication is taking place in a desirable and stable manner Moreover similarly to what was done in for SA control limit procedures able to ensure congestion control in DVB-RCS2 when using CRDSA as transmission mode are discussed II S YSTEM O VERVIEW Consider a multi-access channel populated by a total number of users M Users are synchronized so that the channel is divided into slots and N s consecutive slots are grouped to constitute a so called frame The probability that at the beginning of a frame an idle user has a packet to transmit is p 0  When a frame starts users having a packet to transmit place l copies of the same packet over the N s slots of that frame The number of copies l can be either the same for each packet or not Packet copies are nothing else than redundant replicas except for the fact that each one contains a pointer to the location of the others These pointers are used in order to attempt restoring collided packets at the receiver by means of Successive IC For the sake of simplicity throughout the paper perfect IC and channel estimation are assumed which means that the only cause of disturbance for the correct reception of packets is interference among them Moreover FEC and possible power unbalance are not considered Given these conditions consider the example in Figure 1 representing a frame at the receiver for the case of 2 copies per packet Each slot can be in one of three states  no packet's copies have been placed in a given slot thus the slot is idle  only 1 packet's copy has been placed in a given slot thus the packet is correctly decoded  more than 1 packet's copy has been placed in a given slot thus resulting in interference of all involved packets In DSA if all copies for a given packet collided the packet is surely lost In CRDSA if at least one copy of a certain packet has been correctly received see User 4 the contribution of the other copies of the same packet can be removed from the other slots This process might allow to restore the content of packets that had all their copies colliding see User 2 and iteratively other packets may be correctly decoded up to a point in which no more packets can be restored or until the maximum number of iterations I max for the IC process is reached if a limit has been xed When a retransmission process is present if a packet has not been decoded at the end of the SIC process a feedback is used in order to inform users about the eventual failure of their transmission thus giving birth to a closed loop between USER 2  USER 3  USER 4  USER 1  N s Figure 1 Example of frame at the receiver for CRDSA with 2 copies per packet plain slots indicate that a transmission occurred for that user in that slot the transmitter and the receiver Since this could cause the channel to get to a state of congestion a certain policy able to retransmit unsuccessful packets and transmit newly generated packets while keeping the channel in a desirable point of operation is of great interest III C HANNEL S TABILITY M ODEL In this section we quickly revise the channel stability model introduced in Consider the communication system introduced in Section II Each user can be in one of two states Thinking T or Backlogged B Users in T state are idle users that generate a packet for transmission within a frame interval with probability p 0  if they do no other packets are generated until successful transmission for that packet has been acknowledged Users in B state are users that failed in successfully transmitting their packet and thus are attempting to retransmit it the probability that they retransmit is p r in each frame In the followings we assume that users are acknowledged about the success of their transmission at the end of the frame i.e immediate feedback From we de®ne  N f B

N B  G IN P LR  G IN  N s  d I max  N s p r 2 For the channel load line  in the case of nite population G T  M  N B N s p 0 3 while for M  1 the channel input can be described as a Poisson process with expected value  thinking so that G T   N s 4 for any N B i.e the expected channel input is constant and independent on the number of backlogged packets Notice that the frame number f is not present since in equilibrium conditions always the same value of throughput and backlogged users is expected A De®nition of Stability Equilibrium contours represented in Figure 2 divide the  N B  G T  plane in two parts and each channel load line can have one or more intersections with the equilibrium contour These intersections are referred to as equilibrium points since G OU T  G T  The rest of the points of the channel load line belong to one of two sets those on the left of the equilibrium contour represent points for which G OU T  G T  thus situations that yield to decrease of the backlogged population those on the right represent points for which G OU T  G T  thus situations that yield to growth of the backlogged population From the considerations above we can gather that an intersection point where the channel load line enters the left part for increasing backlogged population corresponds to a stable equilibrium point  since it acts as a sink In particular if the intersection is the only one the point is a globally stable equilibrium point indicated as G G T  N G B  while if more than one intersection is present it is a locally stable equilibrium point indicated as G S T  N S B  If an intersection point enters the right part for increasing backlogged population it is said to be an unstable equilibrium point indicated as G U T  N U B  in the sense that as soon as a statistical variation from the equilibrium point occurs the communication will diverge in one of the two directions of the channel load Figure 2\(a shows a stable channel The globally stable equilibrium point can be referred as channel operating point in the sense that we expect the channel to operate around that point With the word around we mean that due to statistical uctuations the actual G T and N B and thus also G IN and G OU T  may differ from the expected values In fact the model deals with the expected values of G T and G B  and the actual values have binomially distributed probability for G B and G T with nite M and Poisson distributed probability for G T with in®nite M  Nevertheless averaging over the entire history of the transmission simulations in ha v e sho wn that v alues close to the expected ones are obtained thus validating the assumption of considering the expected value N B G T Channel load line Channel operating point a Stable channel N B G T Channel load line Channel saturation point Channel operating point b Unstable channel nite M N B G T Channel load line Channel operating point c Unstable channel in®nite M N B G T Channel load line Channel saturation point d Overloaded channel Figure 2 Examples of stable and unstable channels   0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 f Throughput [G OUT  Figure 3 Simulation throughput for CRDSA with N s  100 slots  I max  20  p 0  0  143  p r  1  M  350 and f indicating the frame sequential number i.e the time from the beginning of the communication in frame time units Figures 2\(b and 2\(c show two unstable channels respectively for nite and in®nite number of users Analyzing this two gures for increasing number of backlogged packets the rst equilibrium point is a stable equilibrium point Therefore the communication will tend to keep around it as for the stable equilibrium point in Figure 2\(a and we can refer to it once again as channel operating point  However this is 


not the only point of equilibrium since more intersections are present Therefore due to the abovementioned statistical uctuations the number of backlogged users could pass the second intersection and return to the right part of the plane causing an unbounded increase of the expected number of backlogged users in the case of in®nite M Figure 2\(c or an increase till a new intersection point is reached in the case of nite M Figure 2\(b In the latter case this third intersection point is another stable equilibrium point known as channel saturation point  so called because it is a condition in which almost any user is in B state and G OU T approaches zero In the former case of in®nite M  N B will increase inde®nitely and we can say that a channel saturation point is present for N B  1  The effect of this saturation is that the related throughput falls off to a value close to zero as illustrated in Figure 3 for the case of unstable channel with nite M  Finally Figure 2\(d shows the case of an overloaded channel In this case there is only one equilibrium point corresponding to the channel saturation point Therefore even though the channel is nominally stable the point of stability occurs in a non-desired region For this reason this case is separated and distinguished from what is intended in this work as stable channel  IV D ESIGN CHOICES AND PARAMETER SETTINGS Given l  N S  I max  in this section we will extensively discuss the role of M  p 0  p r and explain how the communication state changes when changing them First of all this is important in order to understand the relations to be considered in the design phase Moreover the same discussion is introductory to understand how control policies can help to obtain better performance and a stable channel even in case of statistical uctuations that could yield to instability Consider Figure 4 The rst thing we can notice is that M and p 0 only in¯uence the channel load line while changing p r corresponds to a change of the equilibrium contour In Figure 4\(a we can see that p 0 in¯uences the slope of the channel load line that becomes steeper when increasing p 0  This is intuitive to understand since for xed M  if p A 0  p B 0 then G A T  G B T  Figure 4\(b shows that M shifts the channel load line up and down if the population size is respectively increasing or decreasing From Equation 3 we can notice that the value M is nothing else that what is known in literature as q  that is the intersection of the line with the y-axis Finally p r determines a shift upward of the channel load line for smaller values of p r  As we can see in Figure 4\(c if the value p r is suf®ciently small it is possible to stabilize a channel initially unstable This represents the ground base for one of the control policies shown in the next section V C ONTROL L IMIT P OLICIES Previous sections highlighted that statistical variations can yield to instability even in case of initially well-performing channels see Figure 3 To render a channel of that type stable 2 straightforward solutions are available the rst is to use a smaller value for the retransmission probability giving then rise to a larger backlogged population for the same throughput value the second is to allow a smaller user population size M thus resulting in a waste of capacity A third solution that is the one analyzed in this paper is the use of control limit policies to control unstable channels by applying the countermeasures above in a dynamic manner In this section we analyze control procedures of the limit type able to ensure stability This procedures recall those used in for SA In particular two simple yet effective dynamic control procedures are considered the input control procedure ICP and the retransmission control procedure RCP These two control procedures are based upon a subclass of policies known as control limit policies in which the space of the policies is   N B G T p 0  p 0  a Changing p 0   N B G T M  M  b Changing M   N B G T p r  p r  c Changing p r Figure 4 Graphical representation of the changes in the  G T  N B  plane when increasing or decreasing one of the parameters values 


generally composed of two actions and a critical state that determines the switch between them known as control limit In this case the control limit is a critical threshold for a certain number of backlogged users  N B  A Input Control Procedure This control procedure deals with new packets to transmit In particular two possible actions are possible accept action a  or deny action d  and the switch between them is determined by the threshold  N B as previously mentioned B Retransmission Control Procedure As the name says the retransmission control procedure deals with packets to retransmit and in particular with their retransmission probability In particular two different retransmission probabilities p r and p c are de®ned that represent respectively the action taken in normal retransmission state action r  and in critical state action c  From the de®nition above it is straightforward that it must be p r  p c  The switch between these two modes is determined by the threshold  N B    N B G T   a ICP   N B G T p n p c b RCP Figure 5 Control limit policy examples Figure 5 shows two examples corresponding respectively to channels using ICP and RCP As we can see both policies accomplish the same task of ensuring channel stability However while ICP controls the access of thinking users RCP controls the access of backlogged users VI S IMULATION R ESULTS In this section we consider some cases of unstable channels that call for a control policy able to prevent them from saturation In all the cases analyzed M and p 0 are xed stationary and we consider p r  1 and p c small enough to ensure a stable channel All the scenarios have been simulated for 10 6 frames The three scenarios considered are the followings 1 CRDSA with 3 replicas M  300  p 0  0  2  p c  0  39 resulting in N U B  25 when p r  1  2 CRDSA with 3 replicas M  200  p 0  0  34  p c  0  5 resulting in N U B  12 when p r  1  3 CRDSA with 2 replicas M  220  p 0  0  25  p c  0  8 resulting in N U B  39 when p r  1    10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6  N B Throughput      case 1\with ICP case 2\with ICP case 3\with ICP case 1\with RCP   case 2\with RCP   case 3\with RCP   Figure 6 Average throughput versus  N B   10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70  N B  rate of N B   N B      case 1\with ICP case 2\with ICP case 3\with ICP case 1\with RCP   case 2\with RCP   case 3\with RCP   Figure 7 Percent rate of application of the limit control policy versus  N B Figure 6 illustrates the results in terms of throughput both for ICP and RCP for the study cases enumerated above versus  N B  Figure 7 shows the related percentage of frames in which the channel has N B   N B so that the critical action of the control limit policy is applied  d or c depending on the case First of all we can notice that both for ICP and for RCP the range of atness is wider when operating far from the throughput peak This is really important for the following reason Imagine a real application scenario with large delay as it is the case in satellite communications Differently from the case analyzed in this paper when the  N B threshold is crossed the control limit policy needs a certain propagation time before it is applied As a result the effective threshold is not  N B but some value  N B    where  depends on the drift of the

on the propagation delay Therefore the wider is the at region the less the performance optimality of the controlled channel will be in¯uenced by the propagation delay The reason for this difference of atness can be detected from Figure 7 where it can be noticed that in general terms the number of time spent in critical state is greater when closer to the throughput peak This comes from the fact that the operating point of stability and the point of instability N U B are generally closer when approaching the throughput peak while the PLR is greater thus determining are more probable drift beyond N U B  Let us now consider the difference between the case with 2 and 3 replicas As we can see in the case of 2 replicas a degradation of the throughput and a high percentage of time spent in the critical state is also found for a small  N B value In general terms when a control limit policy is applied it does not make sense to choose  N B  N U B  therefore this result does not seem to be of interest for our analysis However let us consider once again the case with large propagation delay If N B   N B the control limit policy will switch to critical state until N B   N B is veri®ed But as previously mentioned users do not immediately switch state due to the propagation delay so that in this case the critical policy is applied for a certain period also when N B is smaller than  N B and this could result in suboptimal performance especially in the case of ICP as shown in Figure 6 Last but not least let us discuss the results when instead of dynamic control limit policy the channel is designed by statically limiting the number of allowed users or by decreasing the retransmission probability so that the channel is always stable Figure 8 shows the case of CRDSA with 3 replicas M  300  p 0  0  2  p c  0  39  In the rst case the number of allowed users must be decreased to approximately M  170 so that the resulting average throughput is around 0  32  The second case consists in decreasing the retransmission probability as done in Figure 8 to 0.39 Also in this second case the resulting throughput is diminished although most of the times this decrement is of small entity However another effect is that the average packet delay is increased Therefore depending on the application also this second solution could be problematic VII C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper a model for computation of the channel stability when using Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha as Random Access mode in DVB-RCS2 has been outlined After analyzing the in¯uence of some crucial parameters such as the transmission and retransmission probability and the population size the paper introduces the concept of control limit policies for such a technique and outlines empirical yet effective procedures for congestion control in case of channels that present the possibility of drifting away to a zone of saturation with low throughput Finally simulation results demonstrate how dynamic control limit procedures can help avoiding congestion while allowing the channel to behave in a optimal manner despite the possibility of instability and also in presence of large propagation delay This work has mainly concentrated on the throughput resulting from the application of this channel procedures However this represents only half of the story since also the related packet delay associated to successful packets is of utmost interest For this reason we are currently preparing an extended version of this work where also this second aspect is analyzed

Table XII Size of SPT on Random Graphs   For unweighted graphs we can deploy Breadth First Search which can compute the single-source shortest path problem in O\(m+n To compute the all-pairs shortest paths we can directly use Dijkstra n times or Floyd-Warshall algorithm which all need time These algorithms are all not suitable for large scale graphs The 2-HOP algorithm proposed by Conhen et al adopts labeling mechanism to answer reachability and distance query Each vertex u records a list of intermediate vertices which it can reach along with the shortest distance and a list of intermediate vertices which can reach it along with the shortest distance To compute the shortest distance between u and v we simply check all the common intermediate vertices between and and choose the vertex s such that s,v is minimized for all  In recent years a lot of algorithms have been proposed for graph reachability queries 6 7 8 9 10 These algorithms mainly discover the connectivity of relevant vertexes but cannot compute the shortest distance between them Vertex cover approaches has lately become the mainstream 10 Through the selecting an approximate minimum vertex cover and constructing an index the reachability query can be answered efciently However they still do not consider the distance computing Ruoming Jin et al put forward a highway-centric labeling approach in which is our counterpart in e xperiment They deploy a novel labeling scheme which select a group of vertices to construct a tree-like highway index structure for answering distance queries in large sparse graphs It can provides better labeling size than 2-hop However in our experimental result we can nd that this method cannot handle large graphs efciently in compare with our algorithm VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we propose a new index construction approach SPTI to answer the shortest path distance query We nd that the distribution imbalance of the edges between the vertices in the real world graphs and utilize the vertices which have more connection with others as index to answer the shortest path distance query To nd a near optimal salutation we propose to selectively choose a group of vertices from the original graph to create a trunk for preserving the shortest paths information and compact the index size Compared with existing methods such as 2HOP online BFS and HCL our algorithm can reduces the index size signicantly and answers the shortest path distance query efciently In the future we plan to apply our index structure on dynamic graphs A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Normal Project Foundation of Education Department of LiaoNing Province Grant No L2012045 R EFERENCES  E W  Dijkstra A note on tw o problems in conne xion with graphs Numerische Mathematic 1\(1 Dec 1959  Richard Bellman On a routing problem Quarterly of Applied Mathematics 16 8790 1958  Eric W eisstein Flo yd-W arshall Algorithm W olfram MathWorld Retrieved 13 November 2009  Edith Cohen Eran Halperin Haim Kaplan and Uri Zwick Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels SIAM J Comput 32\(5 2003  Haixun W ang Hao He Jun Y ang Philip S Y u and Jef fre y Xu Yu Dual labeling Answering graph reachability queries in constant time In ICDE 2006  Y angjun Chen and Y ibin Chen An Ef cient Algorithm for Answering Graph Reachability queries In ICDE 2008  J Cheng J X Y u X Lin H W ang and P  S Y u F ast computing reachability labelings for large graphs with high compression rate In EDBT 2008  J Cheng J X Y u X Lin H W ang and P  S Y u F ast computation of reachability labeling for large graphs In EDBT 2006  Ruoming Jin Ning Ruan Saikat De y and Jef fre y Y u Xu SCARAB Scaling Reachability Computation on Large Graphs In SIGMOD 2012  James Cheng Zechao shang and Hong Cheng K-Reach Who is in Your Small World In VLDB 2012  Ruoming Jin Ning Ruan Y ang Xiang and V ictor E Lee A Highway-Centric Labeling Approach for Answering Distance Queries on Large Sparse Graphs In SIGMOD 2012  W asserman S and F aust K Social Netw ork Analysis Cambridge Cambridge University Press 1994  J Scott Social Netw ork Analysis A Hand-book London Sage Publications 2002  F  Chains Karinthy  Ev erything is Dif ferent Atheneum Press 1929  P  Sanders and D Schultes Highw ay hierarchies hasten e xact shortest path queries In 17th Eur Symp Algorithms\(ESA 2005  http://k onect.uni-k oblenz.de/netw orks/citeseer  accessed May 18 2013  http://snap.stanford.edu/data accessed May 18 2013

Innovation stakeholders social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth Bij reflects big organizations impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ions sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organizations platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organizations operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organizations theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todays cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlights data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlights hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlights method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
