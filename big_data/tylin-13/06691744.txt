Approximate triangle counting algorithms on Multi-cores Mahmudur Rahman and Mohammad Al Hasan Dept of Computer and Information Science Indiana UniversityÑPurdue University Indianapolis mmrahman alhasan}@cs.iupui.edu Abstract Counting triangles in a large network is an important research task because of its usages in analyzing large networks However this task becomes expensive when runs on large networks with millions of nodes and millions of edges For efìcient triangle counting on such networks researchers in recent years have adopted approximate counting or have proposed parallel or distributed solutions In this work we propose an approximate triangle counting algorithm that runs on multi-core computers through a multi-threaded implementation We show that for a given speedup factor our method has a better approximation accuracy further the multi-threaded implementation that we propose is much superior to the Hadoop based distributed methods that earlier algorithms propose I I NTRODUCTION A key task in network analysis is to count the frequency of various small subgraphs to discover network motifs subgraphs that are signiìcantly more frequent in a network relative to their occurrence in a randomized network of identical degree distribution  R es earchers h a v e s ho wn that network motifs are basic building blocks of different networks including social networks molecular interaction networks and transportation networks 2   3    1   T o obt ai n effective algorithms for nding such motifs researchers have developed a number of methods for counting the frequency of small subgraphs in a large networks 5  6  B e s i des exact methods approximate counting algorithms are also considered 7 8  9  Triangle a complete graph of size three is an important network motif in various networks including social networks information networks and molecular interaction networks The reason for triangle being a motif is that in these networks interactions among entities exhibit transitivity property For example in social networks people who have common friends tend to be friend themselves 10 which justiìes the unusual high count for triangles in a social network compared to the same count in a randomized networks of similar scale This phenomenon also prompted social science researchers to deìne two important metrics for graph analysis clustering coefìcient and transitivity ratio 11   12  C ount i n g t ri angl es i s a s ub-rout i n e t o obt ai n t he values of these metrics Given the importance of triangle count in a network in recent years researchers in the data mining community have shown an overwhelming interest in the problem of triangle counting 13 14    15  16    17  18   19  Al t hough t h i s i s an ol d p robl em i n graph t heory  the renewed interest in this problem in mainly due to the fact that gigantic networks with millions of nodes and billions of edges are being available in recent years on which the existing triangle counting methods perform poorly In the existing literatures the best practical algorithm for counting triangles exactly has a cost of O  m 3  2  where m is the number of edges in the graph 20 The a l gori t h m iterates over the edges of the graph and counts the number of triangles in which each of the edges contributes Such an algorithm is known as E DGE I TERATOR method N ODE I T ERATOR  a method which is dual to the E DGE I TERATOR  iterates over the nodes and counts triangle in O  d 2 max  n  time where n is the number of nodes and d max is the maximum degree of a node in the graph Most of the existing methods belong to the E DGE I TERATOR category However in this work we show that for counting triangles in most of the real-life graphs the E DGE I TERATOR shows a better performance than the N ODE I TERATOR  In terms of time complexity the fastest triangle counting methods are based on fast matrix multiplication Alon et al 21 g a v e s uch a n a l gori t h m t hat h as a t i m e c ompl e x i t y of O  m 2   1  where  is the matrix multiplication cost so the cost of this algorithm becomes O  m 1  41  usingthe best known  value which is 2.37 at present However the methods that are based on ma trix multiplication require large amount of memory and hence they are not suitable for counting triangles in very large graphs For todayês large network with millions of vertices and edges all the exact methods for triangle counting can be deemed as expensive so the majority of the recent efforts of triangle counting either adopt a method for approximate counting or design a parallel or distributed framework for solving the counting task effectively For approximate counting 13 propos es DOULION  which uses a probabilistic sparsiìcation technique to obtain a sparser graph then it computes the exact triangle count on the sparse graph from which it extrapolates an approximate triangle count of the original graph Authors of this work also offer a Hadoop An implementation of MapReduce[22 bas e d s ol ut i o n f or this work Hadoop is also used in an exact triangle counting which is recently proposed by Suri and Vassilvitskii 23 A linear algebraic method is also proposed for approximate triangle counting 14 In this paper we propose a variant of E DGE I TERATOR method for approximate triangle counting Our method has 127 2013 IEEE International

a surprisingly high accuracy with a generous speedup On large real-life graphs with millions of nodes and edges the single processor version of our algorithm consistently achieve a 30-fold speedup compared to the best exact method with an accuracy that is around 99 Themost attractive feature of our method is that both the speedup and the accuracy of our method improve as the input graph becomes larger so it is particularly suitable for very large graphs The simplicity of our algorithm also allows a simple multi-threaded implementation of our method for executing on todayês multi-core architectureÑthis improves the speedup even further without harming the counting accuracy We indeed found that for all the real-life graphs that we encountered the multi-core version that we propose is a better choice by a wide margin than all the Hadoop based solutions For a speciìc example on a Wikipedia graph with 1.63 millions vertices and 18.5 millions of edges using 32threads out method obtains a whopping 837-fold speedup with an accuracy of 98  2  None of the Hadoop based solution reports a speedup that is as high as this work Below we list the contribution of this work  We propose a simple yet powerful method for approximate triangle counting It has a surprisingly high accuracy and a high speedup factor both the metrics observably improve as the graph grows larger  We develop two variants of thread-based multiprogramming solutions of our approximate triangle counting algorithm The parallel implementation of these algorithms are simple and effective  We compare the performance of our methods with those of the state-of-the-art approximate triangle counting methods that are available at present on a collection of large real-life networks to validate the superiority of our methods II M ETHOD Assume G  V E  is a graph where V is the set of of vertices and E is the set of edges Each edge e  E is represented by a pair of vertices  v i v j  where v i v j  V  A graph is called simple if it does not contain a self loop and at most one edge exists between two of its vertices In this work we consider simple connected and undirected graphs We denote the adjacency list of a vertex v by adj  v   which contains all the ve rtices that are adjacent to v  In our implementation all the adjacent lists are sorted in the ascending order of the vertex-id Since the graph is undirected for an edge  u v  u appears in v s adjacency list and vice-versa A triangle is represented by a triple of  u v w  where u v w  V and there exists an edge between every pair of vertices in the triple The approximate triangle counting method that we propose in this work is based on the E DGE I TERATOR algorithm that we discuss below Algorithm 1 E XACT EI Require Large network G  V E  1 count 0 2 for each edge  v i v j   E do 3 adj 1   x  x  adj  v i   x  max  v i v j   4 adj 2   x  x  adj  v j   x  max  v i v j   5 count e   intersection  adj 1 adj 2   6 count  count e 7 end for 8 return count Algorithm 2 A PPROX EI Require Large network G  V E   Sample factor p 1 count 0 2 E p  sample p  E  edges from E uniformly 3 for each edge  v i v j   E p do 4 adj 1   x  x  adj  v i   x  max  v i v j   5 adj 2   x  x  adj  v j   x  max  v i v j   6 count e   intersection  adj 1 adj 2   7 count  count e 8 end for 9 count  count/p 10 return count A Exact triangle count by E XACT EI An edge iterator algorithm iterates over each edge e  v i v j   E for counting the total number of triangles for which e is a participating edge Letês call the number of triangles incident to the edge e the partial triangle count with respect to e  and represent it by count e Since a triangle is composed of 3 edges a triangle will appear in exactly 3 of these partial counts E XACT EI can obtain the total count of triangles in G by simply adding the partial counts of all the edges followed by a division by 3 The triple counting of a triangle in the above method can be avoided by imposing a restriction that the third vertex of the triangle say v k  has an id which is larger than the idês of both the vertices v i and v j of the edge e  this yields a more efìcient version of E XACT EI a pseudo-code for which is shown in Algorithm 1 It computes the count e for an edge e  v i v j  as follows it takes the adjacency lists of the contributing vertices v i  adj  v i  nd v j  adj  v j   Then it nds the subsets adj 1 and adj 2 to ensure that the id of the possible third vertex  v k  is strictly higher than the ids of both v i and v j  and then it nds the number of vertices that are common in both adj 1 and adj 2 i.e count e   intersection  adj 1 adj 2    More than 50 of execution time can be saved using this method B Approximate triangle count by A PPROX EI We design an approximate triangle counting algorithm called A PPROX EI by computing the partial count count e  only for a fraction of edges For this A PPROX EI takes 128

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
