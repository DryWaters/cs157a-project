compression objects that are unlikely ever to move to other clusters are discarded Those objects are found by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between the object and the cluster center Those that fall within a chosen radius are then chosen In the second compression period more cluster centers are introduced into the data set in order to nd more stable points After these two compressions the space will be lled with new data The algorithm will keep running until all the data have been processed Farnstrom introduced a special case of this algorithm in which all the points in the b u f fer are discarded each time Gupta uses evolutionary techniques to search for the global optimal solution to the sum of the squares SSQ problem which is required to nd cluster centers Each chunk is viewed as a generation The ttest cluster centers survive to the next generation bad centers are killed off with new ones selected In kernel methods no actual cluster centers exist in RKHS Passing cluster centers to next time step is unpractical The author of presented K ernel P atching Clustering\(KPC algorithm This algorithm selects approximate pseudo-centers at each time step merging them repeatedly until the entire data set has been processed Since the space complexity depends on only the size of chunks algorithms of this type are usually truly scalable 2 Divide and conquer Algorithms in this category cluster each chunk in sequence as well But rather than passing the clustering solution from one chunk onto the next these algorithms aggregate the solutions from each chunk in one nal run Due to this nal run most of the algorithms in this type are not truly scalable Online FCM oFCM was proposed in oFCM aggre gates the solutions from each data chunk by performing wFCM on all the resultant cluster centers Again it was shown in that the k ernel e xtension of oFCM performed poorly Reference vie ws the problem of merging different results from disjoint data sets as the problem of reaching a global consensus while assigns a weight to the cluster centers in each chunk and then performs LSEARCH on all the weighted centers retained LSEARCH is a local search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and then reìnes it by making local improvements Other algorithms like those proposed in and 24 use special initialization techniques to improve the accuracy of the k means algorithm C Data transformation methods Algorithms of this sort transform data into other structures with the intention of making the clustering process more efìcient Perhaps one of the earliest well-known clustering algorithms for data streams is BIRCH which transforms the entire data set into a tree-like structure called a clustering feature CF tree The leaves of the CF tree are then clustered PAM transforms the data set into a graph structure and then searches for a minimum on the graph CLARANS is a variation of CLARA and dra ws a sample of the data set and applies PAM on the sample The key difference between CLARA and CLARANS is that CLARA draws the sample at the beginning of the search while CLARANS draws it at each step of the search The beneìt of the CLARANS approach over CLARA is that the search is not conìned to a localized area While many of the algorithms mentioned in Section II produce high-quality partitions for big data sets unless noted they are not appropriate for kernel clustering The only that we know of truly scalable approach to kernel fuzzy clustering is the spKFCM algorithm proposed in 7 and as sho wn in  the spKFCM approach produces less-than-desirable results for some data sets III K ERNEL FCM Kernel FCM KFCM can be generally deìned as the constrained minimization of J m  U    c  j 1 n  i 1 u m ij   i  v j  2  1a  c  j 1  n  i 1 n  k 1  u m ij u m kj d   x i  x k    2 n  l 1 u m lj   1b where U is a fuzzy partition m 1 is the fuzziìcation parameter and d   x i  x k    x i  x i    x k  x k   2   x i  x k  is the kernel-based distance between the i th and k th feature vectors The function   x i  x k    x i     x k  is the kernel function which can take many forms including the popular radial basis function RBF polynomial and linear forms KFCM solves the optimization problem min  J m  U     by computing iterated updates of u ij   c  k 1  d   x i  v j   d   x i  v k  012 1 m  1   1   i j 2 where the kernel distance between input datum x i and cluster center v j in the RKHS is d   x i  v j     x i   v j  2  3 The cluster centers v are linear combinations of the feature vectors v j   n l 1 u m lj   x l   n l 1 u m lj  4 Equation 3 cannot by computed directly but by using the identity K ij    x i  x j    x i     x j   denoting  u j  u m j   i  u m ij  where u m j  u m 1 j u m 2 j u m nj  T  and substituting 4 into 3 we get d   x i  v j   n l 1  n s 1 u m lj u m sj   x l     x s   n l 1 u 2 m lj    x i     x i   2  n l 1 u m lj   x l     x i   n l 1 u m lj   u T j K  u j  e T i K e i  2  u T j K e i   u T j K  u j  K ii  2  u T j K  i  5 where e i is the n length unit vector with the i th element equal to 1 This formulation of KFCM is equivalent to that proposed 163 


in and furthermore is identical to relational FCM if the kernel   x i  x k   x i  x j  is used Equation 5 shows the obvious problem which arises when using kernel clustering with big data the distance equationês complexity is quadratic with the number of objects i.e O  N 2  assuming the kernel matrix is precomputed Furthermore the memory requirement to store K is also quadratic with the number of objects A Weighted KFCM Assume that each data point in X has a different weight w i  which represents its inîuence on the clustering solution These weights can be applied to the KFCM objective at 1b by J m  U    c  j 1 n  i 1 w i u m ij   i  v j  2  6 where it is now obvious how w R n  w i  0  affects the solution of KFCM Hence the only difference between KFCM and wKFCM is that the distance at 5 in the iterated updates of 2 are computed with the weights included i.e d w   x i  v j  1   w  u m j   w  u m j  T K  w  u m j  K ii  2  w  u m j    w  u m j  T K  i  7 where w is the vector of weights and  indicates the Hadamard product The idea behind wKFCM will be instrumental in our design of the proposed stKFCM algorithm IV S TREAMING KFCM A LGORITHM Consider a streaming data set X   X 1 X 2 X t    and its projection onto a set of RKHSs H K t  such that    1  2  t   are the kernel representations of X  where  t    t 1  t 2  t n   and  t i    x t i  H K t  The goal of the proposed stKFCM algorithm is to approximate the clustering solution of KFCM on X  while only having access to a limited number of chunks of X up to some time t  The naive solution is to store all history of X and run KFCM on all the samples However the memory requirement for storing the kernel matrix K is O  N 2   where N is the number of samples in the history hence KFCM is not appropriate for big data which all streaming data sets become at some point The proposed stKFCM algorithm only requires access to X t and X t  1 at time step t and only requires O  n 2  storage requirement where n is the size of the data chunk X t  Figure 1 illustrates the sub-matrices required by the stKFCM algorithm In similar spirit to stKFCM Havens proposed the streaming kernel k means stKKM algorithm in It pro vides accurate results for using kernel k means with streaming or incremental data The main idea of this algorithm is to take the cluster centers V t  1   v t  1 1  v t  1 c   where v t  1 i  H K t  1  and project them into H K t the RKHS produced by K t  as meta-vectors We will explain metavectors in the following section which proposes stKFCM Using these meta-vectors information is passed from previous n n K t 1 K  t 1 t  K t N N stKFCM only requires storage of 2 \(n ◊ n matrices at each time step Fig 1 The stKFCM algorithm only requires storage of two  n  n  portions of the full  N  N  kernel matrix at each time-step The sub-matrix K t,t  1 is used to project the cluster centers from time  t  1 into the RKHS imposed by the kernel matrix K t  time steps into the current time step Then at each time step the data chunk X t is clustered together with the appropriately weighted meta-vectors We now propose the use of metavectors to approximate KFCM with the stKFCM algorithm A Meta-vectors Assume we are clustering not only the current data chunk X t  but also a set of meta-vectors A   a 1  a 2   a n   a i  H K t  The meta-vectors a i are linear combinations of all  t i   t  i.e a j   n i 1  ij  i   ij R  Proposition 1 Let the partitions U t and U  denote fuzzy partition values of X t and A  respectively Let w X t and w  be the weights of X t and A  Since the cluster centers are linear combinations of the feature vectors the cluster center v t c in the kernel feature space can be written as v t k  n  i 1  q t ik  8 where q t k   015 015  w X t 1  u t 1 k  m   c j 1  t 1 j w  j  u  jk  m w X t 2  u t 2 k  m   c j 1  t 2 j w  j  u  jk  m  w X t n  u t nk  m   c j 1  t nj w  j  u  jk  m      9a  q t k  q t k  w X t   u t k  m    w    u  k  m   9b Proof The meta-partition  q t at 9 is formed by representing the cluster center v t k as the weighted linear sum of the data chunk  t i.e X t  and the meta-vectors A  and using the fact that A is a linear sum of  t itself See for a more detailed proof of a similar proposition Now we show how to project the cluster centers produced at time t  1 i.e in H K t  1  to the current time t  Note that this 164 


proposition is similar to that proposed in for the use with stkKM however it is important to note that the formulation of  q k for KFCM clustering is different from that of kernel k means Proposition 2 A projection of v t  1 k  H K t  1 into H K t can be computed by the optimization over meta-vectors a k  arg min a k  v t  1 k  a k  2  n  i 1  t ik  t i  10 Proof The optimization has the closed form solution of  t k   K t   1 K  t,t  1  q t  1 k  11 K  t,t  1    x t i  x t  1 j  i,j 1   n 12 Remark 1 The closed form solution for the weights  t k at 11 is the solution to the optimization under the squared Euclidean norm The inverse operation in 11 is often best replaced in practice with a pseudo-inverse which we denote by      One could also use a simple gradient descent to minimize the quadratic Furthermore this is only one way to project the cluster center v t  1 k into the current RKHS H K t We imagine that an L1-norm optimization could also nd utility when a sparser solution for  t k is desired The distances between the cluster center v T k and each of a i   t i  and an arbitrary feature vector   x  are computed as  a i  v t k  2   t i  T K t  t i   q t k  T K t  q t k  2  t i  T K t  q t k  13a   t i  v t k  2  K t ii   q t k  T K t  q t k  2 K t  q t k  i  13b    x   v t k  2    x  x    q t k  T K t  q t k  2   x X t   q t k  13c These distances at 13 allow us to propose the stKFCM algorithm at Algorithm 1 The algorithm has the following basic steps 1 The KFCM solution is computed for the rst data chunk 2 The weights of each cluster center are computed as the sum of the partition elements associated with each center 3 The cluster centers are projected into the next time step 4 The meta-partition  q t is computed 5 The partition of the meta-vectors A is updated 6 The partition of the feature vectors X t is updated 7 Optionally the partition of the full data set X can be computed in one single-pass at the end The stKFCM algorithm is essentially a single-pass algorithm that computes the KFCM cluster solution of each X t together with the weighted meta-vectors A  which are the projected cluster centers from step t  1  Hence the compressed information from all previous time-chunks is passed down through the meta-vectors A  Remark 2 The important projection step at Line 3 of the stKFCM algorithm is equivalent to taking the vectors v t  1 appended by n zeroes represented in the RKHS of the kernel matrix K t  1 t   K t  1 K  t  1 t  K  t,t  1 K t   and using the Nystrom approximation to represent them in the low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix computed as and reordered such that the time t columns are rst  K t,t  1   K t  K  t,t  1  T  K t   1  K t  K  t,t  1   Furthermore it is known that the error  K t,t  1   K t,t  1  2 012  n 1  O  N   n   where  n 1 is the  n 1 th eigenvalue of K t,t  1  Jin et al 34 also sho wed that this error is further bounded if there is a large eigengap which is often the case for data sets that can be partitioned into high-quality clusters What this shows for the stKFCM algorithm is that the projection error at each step is bounded hence the total error is bounded by the size and number of data chunks used to complete the stKFCM process V E XPERIMENTS We evaluated the performance of our algorithm on data sets for which ground truth exist In these experiments we compared the hardened partition from the proposed stKFCM to the the recently proposed Kernel Patch Clustering KPC  as well as the KFCM partition run on the whole data set We present results for different chunk sizes from 0  0001 N to 0  5 N  The value of the fuzziìer m was xed at 1.7 The experiments on the 2D15 and 2D50 were run on a Intel Core 2 Duo core processor with 4 GB of memory Results of MNIST and Forest data set were generated by a quad-core CPU with 32 GB of memory The results are expressed as the mean and standard deviation over 100 independent experiments with random initializations and random data sample ordering A Data sets 1 2D15 This synthetic data set is composed of 5,000 2dimensional vectors As shown in Fig 2\(a it is obvious that 15 clusters are preferred in this data set We used an RBF kernel with width of 1 on this data set 2 2D50 This data set consists of 7,500 2-dimensional vectors with 50 clusters preferred An RBF kernel with a width of 1 was used 3 MNIST These data were collected from 70,000 28  28 images of handwriting digits from 0 to 9 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST We normalized the value of each pixel to the unit interval and organized the pixels column-wise into a single 784-dimensional vector Therefore this data set is composed by 70,000 784-dimensional vectors with 10 clusters preferred An inhomogeneous polynomial kernel with degree of 5 was used in our experiment 165

algorithm Note that KPC is faster than stKFCM for larger chunks this is because of the inverse calculation at Line 3 of stKFCM Both KPC and stKFCM produce very good speedup over KFCM at small data chunk sizes while still producing partitions nearly equivalent to the literal KFCM All three fuzzy clustering algorithms produce partitions that do not match well to the ground-truth for the MNIST and Forest data sets which is also the case of k means and other similar crisp partitioning algorithms This does not alarm us as there is a big difference between classiìcation and clustering results i.e classiìcation uses user-supplied labels a.k.a ground truth while clustering aims to nd natural groupings Hence these results simply tell us that the natural groupings in these two data sets as produced by c means partitioning do not match well to the ground truth labels The aim of our proposed algorithm is to approximate the partitions of the KFCM for large data sets And both KPC and stKFCM succeed at that for the MNIST data The stKFCM algorithm exceeds the performance of KFCM for all chunk sizes except for 0.02 while KPC meets or exceeds the KFCM performance for chunk sizes  0  5  clearly the stKFCM outperforms the KPC algorithm for the MNIST data We have seen this behavior i.e the sampled algorithm exceeding the performance of the literal algorithm in other studies 8 and attrib ute it to the inîuence of outliers or noise on the literal algorithm This hypothesis has not been proved On the Forest data both KPC and stKFCM struggle to match the performance of KFCM run on the entire data set in terms of the ARI criteria however in terms of Purity both KPC and stKFCM perform fairly with KPC having a slight edge here We believe that this is caused by the fact that the classes in the Forest data have very unbalanced numbers of samples two of the seven classes Spruce-Fir and Lodgepole Pine comprise greater than 85 of the data set Hence the KPC and stKFCM algorithms which sequentially operate on small samples of the data set can be presented with samples that are comprised mostly of these two classes Overall these results are very pleasing as they show that stKFCM even with very small data chunk sizes achieves clustering performance near to that of KFCM run on the entire data set Furthermore the projection method used in stKFCM shows better performance than the medoid method used by KPC even showing better run-time for some data sets VI C ONCLUSION Big data analysis has become very pertinent It creates many wonderful opportunities accompanied by numerous big challenges Both memory space and computational resources are important considerations in real life applications In this paper we proposed the stKFCM algorithm that signiìcantly reduces both the memory requirement and computational complexity for performing KFCM clustering Empirical results show that stKFCM achieves accurate results while only requiring access to very small portion of the kernel matrix In the future we will examine how we can better represent and pass on the information from previous data chunks including using hybrids of random sampling and projection methods We will also look at other methods of projection with a focus on overall clustering performance R EFERENCES  S F ausser and F  Schwenk er  Clustering lar ge datasets with k ernel methods in Proc Int

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
