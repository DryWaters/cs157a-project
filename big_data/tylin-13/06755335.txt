Abstract 
 
 We study data models for multi-tenant 
databases for Software as a service \(SaaS\which is important for emerging big data applications. In our study we consider the shared table architecture model of SaaS for its advantages over the shared machine and shared process models. Our goal is to further improve the processing time and space utilization of shared table model. For this, we introduce a new data model, called 
and compare its performance with the Chunk table layout. Our model includes an additional index' column in the base table that cross-references via the index across supporting tables. Not needing nulls, the proposed model enjoys quick access of the values in a 
Index table layout 
column. We evaluated the performance of our model, for which we crated randomly large data for Chunk table layout and from which we then constructed the tables for the Index table layout. We also compiled 3 types of queries used in our evaluation. Our results show that Index table layout is better than the Chunk table layout in terms of expressive power, space utilization, and query processing time

is an optimization for hosted services, which improves utilization of resources by providing a uniform framework in which multiple c lients, the çtenantsé, share the same application and database instance, hence allowing scalability and is cost effective. Aulbach and Jacobs p are th e t h ree approach es f o r s h ari ng storage, namely shared machine, shared process, and shared table  Compared to the limitations and shortcomings of the other two approaches, the shared table approach is considered to be more desi   Figure 1 illustrates the shared table approach in which data from many clients is stored in the same table. A 
Tenant Id column is used to identify each tenant/client i.e., the owner of each row. To allow clients to extend the base schema, each table is gi ven a fixed set of additional generic columns. While this approach is suitable for pooling resources, its ability to scale up is limited by the number of rows in the database. Despite this limitation the shared table approach offers much improvement over the shared process approach d m i n i s t rati v e  operations can be executed in bulk simply by executing queries that range over the TenantId attribute, and since it uses a single database, clients can share connection pools  Stefan and Jacobs in di s c u s s t h e v a ri o u s l a y o u t s 
proposed for shared table architecture to support a multitenant scenario. They include Private tables, Extension tables, Sparse columns, Pivot tables, and Universal table They also propose a model, called the Chunk table layout, in which the metadata is divided among application-specific conventional tables and a large fixed set of generic structures, called Chunk tables. The proposed chunk table is complemented with the concept of Chunk folding introduced in [13  w h ich resu lts i n  vertically partitioning of logical tables into çchunks These çchunksé are folded together into different physical multi-tenant tables as and when needed.

competitive for çwideé operations by keeping the data in memory. This is because the cost of reassembling rows is dominated by the time to perform many reads from disk. Advancements in data storage technologies are gradually making main-memory databases more attractive An ideal model for SaaS applies equally well to mainmemory databases. This ve rtical expansion of table helps improve the performance of analytics and RDF data [13    We pr op o se  the I nde x ta b l e la y o ut whic h use s  column-store feature for a Shared table, multi-tenant scenario.  It enjoys the advantages of column store databases such as compression, efficient query processing and space utilization. It also overcomes the limitations of the Chunk table layout for handling certain queries.

Section III introduces the proposed Index Table Layout and its details.  Section IV presents the performance evaluation of the proposed model and finally Section V draws conclusions and advantages of the Index Table Layout II BACKGROUND  AND  RELATED  WORK   Experiments reported in [9 h o w tra n sf or m a tio n s n eeded  to produce queries over Chunk tables by considering the basic case of Pivot Tables and evaluate the efficiency of the Chunk folding method  The performance of Chunk tables is improved by mapping the most heavily-utilized parts of the logical schemas into the conventional tables and mapping the remaining parts into Chunk tables that match their structure as closely as possible. This method, however, is useful in case of partitioning data into heavily and non-heavily utilized parts.  Each of the mode ls discussed in [1 u ilt  from the private table model. In fact, these other models are representations of the privat e tables, however, it is not always easy to convert back these tables into the private tables  This reverse mapping is helpful especially if one wants to automate the process of converting the data in a source schema to cloud database  Let us consider the reverse-engineering process for existing schema-mapping techniques. In general, the base tables for the private table layout have fairly less complex schemas To describe the reverse process, we make our comparisons against the Chunk table     Fig 1.

Though this kind of process is not always required, it may still lead to incorrect results.  For instance, when extra column of existing data type is inserted in the Private table  h e corre s p o n d i ng u p d a t e  h a s t o be do n e o n th e Chunk table layout. Figure 3 illustrates this update. If we were to include another column to Account 17 with a data type e.g., çinté, which already exists we should update the Chunk table, if used as the cloud data schema. Since, in the Chunk table Layout we have the data differentiated by their types, we have to place è4ê in the column èintê with the corresponding entries being Tenant-0, Table-0, Row-0. It can be observed that the Chunk column of the Chunk table layout does not matter in this case as it determines to which of the Chunks it belongs. Note that the Chunks are determined by how heavily the tables are utilized  Figure 4: Updated Chunk table with extra column  Fig.  5. Extended Pivot Table   Note that when inserting 4 as a new value in column Int1, it can replace the entry 135, shown in Figure 4. Besides, the Str1 value corresponding to 4 is not provided Furthermore, columns Tenant, Table, and Row have the same values. As a result, if one wants to construct the Private Table afresh from this model, there will be a problem of ambiguity. In case of an automated process, this may lead to information loss, which is not acceptable In addition to the aforementioned problem, the Chunk table layout assumes that values of similar data types cannot be repeated. To illustrate this, consider the following query taken from [13   SELECT Beds FROM \(SELECT Strl AS Hospital, Intl AS Beds FROM Chunkintlstr WHERE Tenant = 17 AND Table = 0 AND Chunk = 1\AS Accountl7 WHERE Hospita1=`State Here, since both èNameê and èHospitalê are stored under column Str1, the condition Hospital = èStateê means looking for any entry in that column with value èState This results in incorrect query result if there were another value, say èStateê, under the column èNameê in the Private table model \(i.e., the corresponding entry would also be under the column Str1 in the Chunk table\This is a drawback of this model as we may have entries in a table with the same values under different attributes In this paper, we introduce a new data model that improves upon the Chunk table layout. A first step to address this problem, is to eliminate the Chunk column altogether and add a column, called èColê. This column pertains to the number of column of the private table in which the value is placed. Because of this change, there is a considerable change in the schema, as follows. Instead of having both columns Int1 and Str1 in the same column which will cause ambiguity, we just have one column Value for each entry in the table. Figure 5 shows the new table, called Extended Pivot table, which is a combination of Pivot and Chunk ta  Hence with the coordinates being Col, Row, Table, and Tenant, it is straightforward to map the values from the Extended Pivot Table back to the Private Table.  There is now a one to one correspondence between every value in the Extended Pivot table and the private tables. Note that for every value in the table there is a metadata of four coordinate values.  This is a fairly simple model. The queries over this model are less expensive; they are over the Tenant column with a series of AND operations However it is not space efficient. In terms of space taken for the metadata, we perform almost the same. We can further improve the Extended Pivot model keeping in mind the query rewriting aspect. This is discussed next    Chunk int|str  Tenan t  Tabl e  Col Row Value 17 0 0 0 1 17 0 1 0 Acme  17 0 2 0 St Mary  17 0 3 0 135 17 0 4 0 4  35 1 0 0 1 35 1 1 0 Ball 42 2 0 0 1 42 2 1 0 Big 42 2 2 0 65 Chunk int|str Tenan t  Tabl e  Chun k  Row Int1 Str1 17 0 0 0 1 Acme 17 0 3 0 135 St Mary 17 0 0 1 2 Gump 17 0 3 1 1042 State 17 0 3 0 4  35 1 0 0 1 Ball 42 2 0 0 1 Big 42 2 2 0 65

III THE  PROPOSED  INDEX  TABLE  LAYOUT The proposed Index table layout improves the performance in terms of processing time and space utilization. Figure 5 illustrates the Index table layout. The base table and the supporting tables in the queries are ext_base, ext_dealers ext_hospital, and ext_beds. The proposed Index layout is illustrated in Figure 6. It includes a base table that contains all the columns that are common to all the individual multitenant tables \(Private tables\with an additional column called the The tuples in the schema are the tuples related to all the tenants. The index column is defined as NOT NULL and UNIQUE KEY, and is incremented automatically with insertion of each tuple. Hence in our example, the Index table layout would have the attributes Apart from the base tables we have other supporting tables, each having two columns one for the and the other for the unique columns    Fig. 6.  Index Table Layout In other words, if there are n non-common columns among the private tables, we would have n supporting tables along with a base table. As a part of representation, only the valid and existing records go into the supporting tables and these rows have a matching èIndexê value from the base table. In Figure 2, for instance, when the index is 2, it means Tenant 17 has a value with Aid as 2, Name as èGumpê, Hospital as St. Maryê, and the number of Beds è1042.ê Since there are no dealers for èGumpê we totally avoid writing a Null value or reserving a place for it in the supporting table for dealers This will not only avoid the problem of sparsely populated tables but also enable writing only the values that are required This way, there is one to one correspondence between values in the Index Layout and the Private Table Layout Hence, rewriting back the Index table layout to the Private table is possible when automated. In terms of queries, this layout can give faster results to queries with predicates on columns. An example would be: çGive the names of all hospitals.é This is a select distinct operation over the supporting table for Hospitals. This would have otherwise been a complex query consisting of many AND operations over several conditions on columns with values, each of which ranging and changing over many figures. Hence, with respect to both correctness and clarity, the Index Layout is an option over the Chunk tables, Pivot tables and Extended Pivot tables.  Addressing queries that are common over all the tenants are obviously queried upon the base table over the tenant id. So the queries are not complex. The worst case query would be the only query that has a join operation over all the tables with the predicate on the èIndexê value. Hence the Index table layout improves both upon the space and query processing The advantages of the proposed Index table layout include better space utilization for not needing nulls, fast access of the values in a column, and indexing.  The worst case scenario would be when performing a join operation over all the supporting tables, which is expensive. Thus the number of joins is equal to the number of supporting columns for the worst case scenario IV EXPERIMENTS  AND  RESULTS We conducted experiments using MySQL Workbench 5.2 CE using an Intel Xeon Processor with 4 GB RAM. In order to simulate the test beds, the schema for the Private tables were first created. The schema for Chunk and Index table layouts are created next. The data is generated for all the layouts so as to maintain the equivalence of data between both the layouts. In order to do this, many scripts were written. Perl and Shell scripting was used for generation of data.  We first wrote scripts to randomly generate large data for the Chunk table layout and then constructed the individual tables and the tables for Index table layout from this data. Hence, there is a one to one correspondence between data in the private tables and the data in the index and Chunk table layouts The Database layout is an OLTP schema with one-to-many relationships. Individual users within a business \(a tenant are not modeled, but the same tenant may engage in several simultaneous sessions so data may be concurrently accessed. Every table in the schema has a tenant-id column so that it can be shared by multiple tenants.  Each of these tables contains about 20 columns, one of which is the Base Table Index Tenant Aid Name 1 17 1 Acme 2 17 2 Gump 3 42 1 Big 4 35 1 Ball Index Number of Beds 1 135 2 1042 Index Hospital 1 St Mary 2 State 3 Gump Index Dealers 3 65

entityês ID. Every table has a primary index on the entity ID and a unique compound index on the tenant ID and the entity ID. The experiments include CRUD operations and reporting tasks that simulate the daily activities of individual users. To facilitate the analysis of experimental results, the queries are grouped ranging from light weight actions to heavy actions. These can be seen in queries of Type 1. We first construct a Chunk table that has 10 4 rows and constructed the appropriate Private and Index tables We then keep increasing the number of tuples by multiples of ten. We compare the results of the Chunk tables with 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 and 10 8 tuples and their corresponding tables represented in our Index model While we have considered all the queries that were used to test in the evaluation phase of w e a l s o d i s c us s  a  variety of other queries. We compare the two models based on expressivity and flexibility with which one can formulate queries, and on efficiency of query processing As mentioned earlier, the Chunk table is limited in its modeling capabilities. We also note that the Chunk table layout can be constructed from the Private table layout, but the reverse is not possible We considered different types of queries in performance evaluation of different data models. A classification of query types is as follows, together with an explanation of why such queries were considered Note that in all the graphs logarithmic scale is used to accommodate values.  This is because in most of the cases the execution times is a fraction of a second and hence the values fall below the axis.  For maintaining uniformity and to accommodate a large range of values \(say, values from 0.1 to  90,000 seconds\,  logarithmic scale has been used in all our graphs.  So, throughout this paper, for a bar graph showing execution times falling below the axis, it represents a fraction of a second These are queries supported by Chunk table layout and our proposed Index table layout We observe that for Chunk table layout, it is not possible to pose a query that retrieves information for a predicate over two or more columns. Since queries require values of the columns from meta-data columns \(like row, col, table\and the values of meta-data columns are usually not constant and there is clear ambiguity in values under different columns. Hence queries that can be posed both against the Chunk table and Index table layouts are simple select queries. It should be noted that most queries in SaaS are usually over single columns or involve simple predicates Comparison of fetch times between Chunk and Index table layouts is shown in Figure 8. It indicates that the fetch times of Index table layout improve upon the Chunk table layout by about a degree of magnitude These are queries found and collected from the related literature In e a u th ors co m p are p e rfor m a n c e of  Chunk t a b l e  layout using different DBMSs. For this, they considered types of queries on attributes for various layouts such as Private and Extension layouts. The query types used in their experiments were Select 1, Select 50, Select 1000 Insert 1, Insert 50, Update 1, and Update 100 attributes evaluated against different layouts. Figures 9 shows the comparison of fetch times between Chunk and We have only shown Type 1 for 10 4 tuples here. It can be observed that for Type 1 queries, the performance of Chunk table and Index table layouts are almost the same These are queries supported by the Index table layout only A drawback of Chunk table layout is that queries including predicates on different columns are not possible to express This limits expressive power of the model, in that user and/or service provider ca nnot formulate a variety of queries. In our experiments, we have compiled a list of queries consisting those used in the experiments reported in  n d addit i o nally  f r o m o u r s We r ecord th e f e t c h  t i m e s  for tables of tuple with size ranging from 10 4 to 10 8 tuples Appropriate configuration settings have been set in MySQL \(my.ini in windows and my.cnf in linux\to support large tuple sized tables in the experiments. Figure 10 illustrates: Performances of different queries of Type 2 for tables of different tuple sizes We used the following queries in our experiments. They include the queries as defined and used in n d n e w o n e s  as Type 2 queries we define in our context of this work. We remind that these queries could not be posed for the Chunk table layout Select distinct names of hospitals For the Index table layout, this query may be expressed as follows Formulating a corresponding query for the Chunk table layout is not possible. This is because we query over the column Str1 which accepts any value of the type String These entries need not necessarily be the entries corresponding to the same column in the Private table layout. Having predicates over the columns Chunk, row table, and tenant do not help either Find the number of entries for tenant 17 Query formulation for the Index table layout would be For the Chunk table, this query could be expressed as follows

 However, this does not return the result expected, explained as follows. The number of tuples in the Chunk table grows as the number of columns in Private table grows. In our running example, since each tuple is represented in two columns in the Chunk table, we cannot assume that the number of entries for Tenant 17 would be a multiple of a fixed number \(2, in our case List the hospitals and their number of beds For the Index table layout For Chunk table layout, this query could be expressed as Note a restriction here which assumes, by default, that State is assumed is of type Str1, which may not be true Find number of beds for Tenant 17 For the Index table layout, this query is formulated as follows The above query could not be expressed for the Chunk Table layout since selecting any value from the attribute çInt1é would include values corresponding to other possible attributes of all the tenants Find details of tenant, aid, name, and hospitals For the Index table  This query cannot be expressed over the Chunk Table layout Find details of hospitals and beds for each tenant This query for the Index table layout can be expressed as follows, which includes two join operations over the common attributes among the tables, namely ext_base ext_hospital, and ext_beds This query is not possible to express for the Chunk Table layout. This is because in a Chunk table, data values of similar type are stored in one column, and hence having predicates over Tenant, Chunk, and row in the WHERE clause do not help in retrieving the right data.While queries of types 0, 1, and 2 measure expressivity of the schema, we also compare the Chunk table and Index table layouts based on their space requirements. In the Index table layout, common data among tenants is always stored in the base table. The supporting tables would only include necessary rows. This reduces the space utilization to a large extent. We hence compare the sizes of Chunk table and the Base table of the Index table layout. Figure 7 illu strates the results of this comparison V CONCLUSION We studied suitable date models for multi-tenant databases, which is important to manage big data in the context of cloud computing paradigm. We proposed a data model that improves chunk model in space utilization as well as query processing. The correctness of the proposed model was discussed and illustrated through various query types We note that in terms of space, the Index table layout takes almost two third of the space taken by the Chunk table layout. We observe that the query processing times of Index table layout for queries of Type 0 improve by an order of magnitude. We also observe that the query processing times for queries that can be posed both against the Chunk table and the Index table layout \(Type 1\most the same. We compile an exhaustive set of queries as Type 2. These queries could not be supported by the Chunk table layout. This is due to the inflexibility of the Chunk table layout and poor design. Since the Index table layout is a ver tically partitioned schema, we can take advantage of column store features. This is an advantage as most of the queries for SaaS are posed on individual columns The index column of the base table can be further indexed, sorted or even hashed if the application demands  This is useful in case the schema has to be

further extended to a data warehouse like application scenario as many CUBE operations involve individual columns. The result of our experiments and analyses indicate that our proposed Index layout is more expressive than the Chunk table layout, and results in much improvemen t in performance in terms of space utilization through compression and is more expressive for supporting a wider range of query types. Its vertical partitioning and its column-store like design leads to significant increase in query processing performance. Other advantage of the Index table layout is that the mapping step of the Index table is much less complicated than that of Chunk Folding    Figure 7.

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
