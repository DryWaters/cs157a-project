I I NTRODUCTION Data processing and data analysis techniques are applied to discover useful information and value inside a data set When traditional processing techniques cannot efìciently cope a data set due to its size we could refer to such a data set as  F or processing big data ef ciently  platforms and technologies for example Hadoop HDFS 
Hypertable Hive and Amazon Mechanical Turk are suggested In this paper we mainly focus on crowdsourcing for processing data Basically crowdsourcing can offer a distributed problem-solving environment where a number of humans are assigned to execute tasks In the cro wdsourcing en vironment some problems could be less complex when solved by the human than when solved by the computer-based system Crowdsourcing has been applied for various data processing tasks for example data collection data classiìcation 5 data validation data annotation 7 and natural language processing Amazon Mechanical T urk and InnoCenti v e are for example crowdsourcing environments where tasks 
i.e small job units can be dispatched to human workers When the size of data becomes part of problems that a conventional computer system cannot efìciently address a crowdsourcing marketplace can be another source of big data processing power In this paper we propose a service model namely 
HumanIntelligence-as-a-Service 
HIaaS This model utilizes human intelligence in a crowdsourcing marketplace for processing big data By splitting big data to a number of tasks tasks can be distributed to a crowd for processing in a parallel fashion Software components required to operate 
the HIaas by a provider are recommended This model also presents that two key types of workers namely ondemand and contract workers should be available in the crowdsourcing marketplace Next the paper proposes an optimization model namely 
HIaaS Resource Provisioning Optimization 
HRPO based on stochastic programming We derive this HRPO primarily from a HIaaS customerês perspective for minimizing the cost to provision workers processing big data from HIaaS providers Numerical studies are performed to evaluate the HRPO A video rating system handling a large number of video clips considered as a big data set is an illustrative example analyzed in the studies 
The results show that the HRPO can efìciently reduce the cost to provision workers for processing the big data job The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II presents an overview of the HIaaS model Section III describes the system model and assumption The proposed optimization model of the HRPO is discussed in Section IV Section V presents the numerical studies to evaluate the HRPO The paper is summarized in Section VI II O VERVIEW OF H UMAN I NTELLIGENCE AS A S ERVICE In Fig 1 the architectural layers of cloud com 
puting services are presented i.e Software-as-a-Service SaaS Human-Intelligence-as-a-Service HIaaS Platformas-a-Service PaaS and Infrastructure-as-a-Service IaaS The details of SaaS PaaS and IaaS layers can be found in The authors in 10 also mentioned the term Human as a Service HuaaS which is related to the HIaaS model However software components required to operate the HuaaS model were not proposed Moreover the HuaaS model did not address human resource provisioning for big data processing In this paper we propose the HIaaS model

Figure 1 Layers of Cloud Computing Services speciìcally coined for big data processing in a crowdsourcing environment We also propose software components forming basic building blocks of a HIaaS-based platform and derive an optimization model to provision human workers for processing big data jobs The optimization model considers uncertainties of availability of human workers unit price of man-hour and the number of big data tasks To the best of our knowledge human resource provisioning under the uncertainties for big data processing in the crowdsourcing environment has never been exclusively studied Basically a HIaaS platform can be implemented on top of either Paas or IaaS Later software applications e.g scientiìc applications and SaaS can be built on top of the HIaaS platform Then a HIaaS provider can provide programming libraries i.e APIs or Web Services to software developers who are HIaaS customers for implementing applications that allow big data to be processed in the HIaaS providerês platform With the HIaaS platform a big data set of a job can be divided into a number of data chunks Data chunks of the same job can be processed by a number of workers given the same function e.g image annotation and data classiìcation in a parallel fashion A function with a data chunk can be referred to as a HIT Note that the term Human Intelligence Task HIT is coined as the unit of work on Amazon Mechanical Turk The conceptual software components required to operate the HIaaS platform shown in Fig 1 are described as follows 1  This component admits HITs from a HIaaS customer The outsourcer also provides a mechanism for the provider and the customer to negotiate prices to provision workers and service-levelagreement SLA to operate HITs before the HITs will be processed 2  The results of processing HITs are stored in the data repository Moreover the customer can store data chunks of jobs in this data repository 3  Based on a scheduling policy the scheduler assigns HITs to workers 4  The recruiter acts as a human resource department recruiting workers for processing HITs 5  This component provides an interface to a worker Through the interface the worker can receive display and process a HIT and then the worker can submit the HIT result to the data repository 6  HITs are tracked by the monitor so that the HIaaS customer can check the progress and status of HITs With the information from the monitor the HIaaS provider can evaluate workers performance and plan to provision workers as well 7  The logger records activities in the HIaaS platform for debugging and auditing purposes 8  This component can charge the HIaaS customer and electronically transfer remuneration to workers The implementation of a HIaaS platform will be extensively addressed in the future work Basically all the software components of the platform can be deployed as Web Services so that service invocations to the components can be conveniently performed Moreover a job can be developed as a MapReduce job which is speciìcally designed for processing large data sets W ith the MapReduce programming model HITs can be map tasks or reduce tasks which can be assigned to workers by a master i.e the scheduler in Fig 1 Hence the HIaaS platform must provide APIs supporting MapReduce for such a job In addition a web application connecting to the worktable component can be provided to workers such that the workers can conveniently handle HITs Fig 2 depicts a process ow diagram representing ows starting from a HIaaS customer to ve software components and a worker III S YSTEM M ODEL AND A SSUMPTION In this section we deìne the system model and assumption of a crowdsourcing marketplace where HIaaS providers exist A single HIaaS customer is considered in the model The customerês objective is to provision workers from HIaaS providers through both on-demand and contract options for processing HITs of jobs Let denote the set of jobs The total number of HITs of job is denoted by  Let be the deadline or the maximum amount of time required to complete every HIT of job  The amount of time to process a HIT is called and its measurement unit is  Let denote the set of HIaaS providers Each provider employs workers for processing HITs We assume that workers in HIaaS are skilful to perform HITs It is assumed that the HIaaS provider deìnes SLAs to guarantee the processing time and quality for handling HITs from the customer Let denote the maximum processing time deìned in the SLA to process a single HIT of job by provider  We assume that SLAs of all providers are not violated

Figure 2 Process ow diagram in HIaaS To simplify the model the main objective of our proposed optimization model is only to minimize the human provisioning cost Therefore the cost of data transfer including both downlink and uplink between the customer and the providers are assumed to be neglected We also assume that data chunks of all jobs are initially stored in a centralized storage e.g a FTP/HTTP host and cloud storage When a HIT is processed by a worker its associated data chunk will be instantly transferred from the storage to the worker All results of HITs will be stored in the data repository shown in Fig 2 Next the customer can retrieve the results anytime This paper ignores the cost to utilize the data repository Finally the results of the HITs can be statistically analyzed through traditional MapReduce e.g Hadoop Two options to process HITs are assumed to be available in HIaaS providers namely on-demand and contract options These options are similar to the options available in IaaS providers e.g Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure With the on-demand option the customer can submit jobs to be processed and then the cost is charged to the customer on a pay-per-use basis according to the real usage of processing time required for HITs i.e the number of used man-hours A HIaaS provider can adjust the number of workers and prices for the on-demand option according to the supplyand-demand of workers For job processed in provider  let and denote the unit cost i.e  per man-hour and the number of available workers in the on-demand option respectively With the contract option the customer subscribes to a contract by stating the number of contract workers required for HITs and then the unit cost of the contract option is xed and generally cheaper than the on-demand option within a speciìc time duration called  Different contract durations e.g 7-day 3-month and 1-year durations can be available The number of contract workers will be available only within the contract duration Therefore the customer can choose an appropriate duration and pay an upfront cost to obtain the cheaper unit price Furthermore the customer should provision the appropriate number of contract workers to hedge against risks of uctuating price and the unavailability of workers in the on-demand option In this paper it is assumed that only one time duration is available and able to meet all the job deadlines Let denote the cost to hire a contract worker to process job in provider  In practice the contract option needs to be requested and signed by the customer in advance such as 1-month or 3month early With the advance request the HIaaS provider can prepare the number of contract workers to meet the customerês request Contract workers will be reserved to work for certain contracts It is possible that the number of HITs of a job cannot be known by the customer in advance For example at the moment when the customer purchased the contract option the customer might not realize the actual number of HITs at the later moment when the signed contract has commenced Moreover the unit price of man-hours and the number of workers in the on-demand option can uctuate Due to these uncertainties it is not trivial to achieve the optimal solution to sign contract workers Either over-subscription or under-subscription of a signed contract can occur The over-subscription results in wasteful expenditure In contrast the under-subscription results in the higher cost to hire ondemand workers Furthermore the number of on-demand workers might not be sufìcient to complete HITs and meet the deadline This paper addresses the uncertainties by deriving a stochastic programming optimization model W ith the model all possible values of the uncertainty parameters are described by Let denote the set of all scenarios Given job and provider  denotes the random vector of scenario where   and denote the number of HITs the number of available on-demand workers and unit-price of on-demand option respectively Scenario is associated with a certain probability denoted by  A probability distribution associated with scenarios in is assumed to be known It is assumed that the probability distribution has  That is has a nite number of scenarios with probability

where  Decision variables for the stochastic programming optimization model can be mapped into three groups namely    is the set of non-negative integers Variable denotes the number of contract workers to be hired through the contract option for job in provider  Under scenario  variable denotes the number of man-hours to be utilized from the contract worker for job in provider  Under scenario  the number of contract workers could be deìcient to process remaining HITs Consequently the number of man-hours denoted by can be dynamically provisioned through the on-demand option IV HI AA SR ESOURCE P ROVISIONING O PTIMIZATION In this section we propose the HIaaS resource provisioning optimization HRPO based on the stochastic programming optimization model with two-stage recourse The objective function of the model is deìned as follows Min 1 The objective function in 1 is to minimize the cost to provision workers for processing big data jobs while the deadlines of the jobs can be met and the uncertainty are taken into account Under the uncertainties described by scenarios i.e  denotes the expectation of costs paid for the on-demand option denotes the composite variable consisting of all decision variables  Given scenario and composite variable  function Q in 1 represents the cost to utilize the on-demand option as fully expressed as follows Q Min 2 subject to 3 4 5 6 In 2 function Q is a minimization problem consisting of four groups of constraints The number of contract workers which can be provisioned by the customer is controlled by constraint 3 where denotes the maximum number of contract workers which can be supplied by provider for job  Constraint 4 ensures that all the HITs will be processed Constraint 5 governs the utilization of contract workers Constraint 6 controls the number of man-hours which can be utilized through the on-demand option Next the stochastic programming optimization model shown in 6 is transformed into the deterministic equivalence which can be efìciently solved by an optimization solver supporting mixed integer programming for example a solver available in NEOS The deterministic equi v alence can be fully expressed as follows Min 7 subject to 8 9 10 V N UMERICAL S TUDIES The proposed HRPO is evaluated by performing numerical studies A video rating system VRS for a streaming media service is analyzed in the studies The VRS has new numerous one-minute video clips in every month which can be considered as a big data set The VRS needs to classify every clip to a speciìc rate For example there are four rates used in a television content rating system in Thailand i.e C U PG-13 and 18 Then the VRS annotates each clip by listing at least four keywords or tags The average size of the one-minute video clip is 443.27 MB Note that this video clip size is based on the H.264 720p format with resolution  1280x720 and frame rate  30fps and estimated by the Video Space Calculator In every 3 months the average number of video clips gathered by the VRS is 216,416 That is 96TB of storage capacity is required Currently a computer-based system cannot efìciently process such a big data set The VRS is then considering a HIaaS-based crowdsourcing marketplace Only one job is considered i.e  A HIT of the job consists of both rating and annotation functions It is assumed that the VRS is going to apply HIaaS for the next big data set only The number of HITs i.e the number of video clips is not known in advance For example the VRS needs to purchase the contract option a month early before the actual number of HITs will be realized so that the provider can prepare the sufìcient number of contract workers required by the VRS The probability distribution of the number of HITs can be obtained from historical data A probability distribution used in is applied for the probability distribution of the number of HITs and depicted in Fig 3\(c Two HIaaS providers are considered in the studies namely and  The VRS has to sign contracts with the two providers in advance Moreover the contract workers could be trained to enhance the skill performing the job Both

Fig 3: Running Time on different scale data in cloud platform \(log scale Secondly, speed-up ratio on different number of nodes is used to evaluate our proposed methodês performance and effect of parallel computation. Using our large citation data set we also perform speedup experiments on a Hadoop platform using 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 computer nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, where it is observed that speed-up ratio is rising with the increasing of no des. In particular, time on twelve nodes cost more than that on two nodes when Microbloggersê size is 100. The reason is that when the cloud platform dealing with small amount of data, the cost of task scheduling an d network communication overhead outperforms the time saving from nodeês increments. However, with the increment of the data scale, the speedup shows reasonable parallel efficiency with 10 Fig 4: Speedup ratios on different scale data in cloud platform

of our distributed approach on MapReduce Model varying different scale datasets with 1 00/1000/10000/100000 respectively The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. In the figure when the Microblogger number is 100, time on twelve nodes is more than two nodes. However, with the increasing of test data scale, time on more than one node is significantly less than the operational time on single node. Thus, the experimenta l result illustrates the H matrix calculation based on the MapReduce Model can effectively alleviate the perform ance bottleneck with the growth of data size 000\003  speedup using 12 computer nodes  000\003 In this paper, a tensor factorization framework based on cloud computing platform is proposed for mining social influence in Microblogging. In the framework, features are extracted for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis on the Microblog gersê relations. And then Tensor factorization is employed to infer userês implicit userês relations. Furthermore, a distribu ted learnin g algorithm has been implemented un der the Map-reduce programming model. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component Experiments on Sina Weibo dataset \(Chinese Microblogging platform\ show that our proposal significantly not only improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods, but also has competitive advant age for processing ma ssive data from Microblogging

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
