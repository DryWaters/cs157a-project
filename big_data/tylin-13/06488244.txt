VII F UTURE W ORK Current Abstract Rendering implementations closely tie the bin-elements with the display resolution and region This decision introduces view-dependent effects View-dependent effects are used advantageously in high-de“nition alpha composition but may not always be desirable Developing techniques for avoiding these effects and guidelines for their usage is an ongoing effort Section V described implementation considerations There are several unexplored options that may lead to more ef“cient implementations or to implementations that run in more complex runtime environments Options include distributed memory or ef“cient GPU execution The idea of binning is shared inMens Abstract Rendering can be applied to more than just overplotting High-de“nition alpha composition rests on the idea of measuring pixel-level information This same idea can be applied to screen-space metrics for visualization evaluation 17 Such applications are also being e xplored The idea of the transfer function comes from scienti“c visualization However years of research into transfer functions has yielded many interesting techniques Mixed rendering styles and context-aware highlighting are strong candidates for exploration Additionally as noted in Section I Z-ordering creates an implicit volume-like space Some volume-based techniques from scienti“c visualization maybe more directly applicable by more literally applying this metaphor VIII C ONCLUSIONS Visualizing large data sets inevitably runs into overplotting issues By considering the rendering process as binning Abstract Rendering provides a means to unify many overplotting techniques Furthermore those techniques can be encoded succinctly at compile time and executed ef“ciently at runtime R EFERENCES  S K Card J

Innovation stakeholders’ social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits.

Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ion’s sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organization’s platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organization’s operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organization’s theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
