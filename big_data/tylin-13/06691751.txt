II D ATA M INING T ECHNIQUES A Modeling We used 47 classiìcation schemes in this study including both direct application of classiìcation techniques and also constructing their ensembles using various ensembling techniques Due to space limitations here we brieîy describe only those classiìcation/ensembling techniques whose results we present in the next section 1 Support vector machines  SVMs are based on the Structural Risk Minimization\(SRM principle from statistical learning theory A detailed description of SVMs and SRM is available in In their basic form SVMs attempt to perform classiìcation by constructing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that separates the cases of different class labels It supports both classiìcation and regression tasks and can handle multiple continuous and nominal variables 2 Artiìcial neural networks  ANNs are networks of interconnected artiìcial neurons and are commonly used for non-linear statistical data modeling to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs The network includes a hidden layer of multiple artiìcial neurons connected to the inputs and outputs with different edge weights The internal edge weights are learnt during the training process using techniques like back propagation Several good descriptions of neural networks are available 10 It has been used for accurate estimation in different areas such as mobile health drug ab use 12 ci vil engineering  computer vision 14 and video deli v ery 15 16 3 Decision Table  Decision table typically constructs rules involving different combinations of attributes which are selected using an attribute selection search method Simple decision table majority classiìer has been shown to sometimes outperform state-of-theart classiìers 4 KStar  KStar is a lazy instance-based classiìer  i.e the class of a test instance is based upon the class of those training instances similar to it as determined by some similarity function It differs from other instance-based learners in that it uses an entropy-based distance function 5 Reduced error pruning tree  Commonly known as REPTree it is a implementation of a f ast decision tree learner which builds a decision/regression tree using information gain/variance and prunes it using reduced-error pruning 6 Random forest  The Random Forest classiìer consists of multiple decision trees The nal class of an instance in a Random Forest is assigned by outputting the class that is the mode of the outputs of individual trees which can produce robust and accurate classiìcation and ability to handle a very large number of input variables It is relatively robust to overìtting and can handle datasets with highly imbalanced class distributions 7 Alternating decision tree  ADTree is decision tree classiìer which supports only binary classiìcation It consists of two types of nodes decision nodes specifying a predicate condition like age  45 and prediction nodes containing a single real-value number ADTrees always have prediction nodes as both root and leaves An instance is classiìed by following all paths for which all decision nodes are true and summing the values of any prediction nodes that are traversed This is different from the J48 decision tree algorithm in which an instance follows only one path through the tree 8 Decision stump  A decision stump is a weak treebased machine learning model consisting of a singlelevel decision tree with a categorical or numeric class label Decision stumps are usually used in ensemble machine learning techniques 9 Naive Bayes  The naive bayes classiìer is a simple probabilistic classiìer that is based upon the Bayes theorem This classiìer makes strong assumptions about the independence of the input features which may not always be true It makes use of the variables contained in the data sample by observing and relating them individually to the target class independent of each other Despite this assumption the naive bayes classiìer works well in practice for a wide variety of datasets and often outperforms other complex classiìers 10 Bayesian Network  A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among a set of variables representing a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph DAG Bayesian network learning can be used with various search algorithms for searching the network structures and estimator algorithms for nding the conditional probability tables of the network 11 Logistic Regression  Logistic Regression is used for prediction of the probability of occurrence of an event by tting data to a sigmoidal S-shaped logistic curve Logistic regression is often used with ridge estimators to impro v e the parameter estimates and to reduce the error made by further predictions 12 AdaBoost  AdaBoost is a commonly used ensembling technique for boosting a nominal class classiìer In general boosting can be used to signiìcantly reduce the error of any weak learning algorithm that consistently generates classiìers which need only be a little bit better than random guessing It usually dramatically improves performance but is also prone 2 


to overìtting 13 LogitBoost  The LogitBoost algorithm is an ensembling technique implementation of additive logistic regression which performs classiìcation using a regression scheme as the base learner and can handle multi-class problems In the authors e xplain the theoretical connection between Boosting and additive models 14 Bagging  Bagging is a meta-algorithm to impro v e the stability of classiìcation and regression algorithms by reducing variance Bagging is usually applied to decision tree models to boost their performance It involves generating a number of new training sets called bootstrap modules from the original set by sampling uniformly with replacement The bootstrap modules are then used to generate models whose predictions are averaged to generate the nal prediction Bagging has been shown work better with decision trees than with linear models 15 Random subspace  The Random Subspace classiìer constructs a decision tree based classiìer consisting of multiple trees which are constructed systematically by pseudo-randomly selecting subsets of features trying to achieve a balance between overìtting and achieving maximum accuracy It maintains highest accuracy on training data and improves on generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity 16 Rotation Forest  Rotation forest is a method for generating classiìer ensembles based on feature extraction which can work both with classiìcation and regression base learners The training data for a the base classiìer is created by applying Principal Component Analysis PCA to K subsets of the feature set followed by K axis rotations to form the new features for the base learner to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble B Feature Selection Feature selection techniques are typically used to select a subset of relevant features for use in a model It is based on the assumption that data contains many redundant or irrelevant attributes that do not add much to the information provided by other existing attributes We used 2 feature selection techniques in this study 1 Correlation Feature Selection CFS  CFS is used to identify a subset of features highly correlated with the class variable and weakly correlated amongst them  CFS w a s used in conjunction with a greedy stepwise search to nd a subset S with best average merit which is given by Merit S  n  r fo  n  n  n  1  r ff where n is the number of features in S  r fo is the average value of feature-outcome correlations and r ff is the average value of all feature-feature correlations 2 Information Gain  This is used to assess the relative predictive power of the predictor attributes which evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the outcome status IG  Class Attrib  H  Class   H  Class  Attrib  where H    denotes the information entropy The CFS technique evaluates subsets rather than individual attributes so it was rst used to nd a smaller subset of attributes Subsequently information gain was used on the reduced set of attributes to get a ranking of the attributes in the order of their predictive potential as information gain evaluates each attribute independently III UNOS D ATA The UNOS STAR Thoracic Organ Transplant and Waiting List File contains data on all transplant candidates and transplant recipients of heart lung and heart-lungs that have been listed or performed in the U.S and reported to the OPTN since October 1987 Data entry by all US transplant centers is mandated by the 1984 National Transplantation Act This cohort totals over 37,000 observations There is one record per waiting list registration/transplant event Each record includes the most recent follow-up data including patient and graft survival waittime and the patientês list status e.g waiting transplanted removed prior to transplant or dead This dataset contains nearly 500 elds to characterize candidate/recipient and donor information including demographics eg age race sex social history and clinical information eg blood type measures of lung function and hemodynamic measures past medical and surgical history serologies and severity of co-morbid illness UNOS provided de-identiìed patient-level data data source 01052011-6 These data include all lung transplant recipients and donors in the U.S and reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network between January 1 2005 and December 31 2009 The use of these data is consistent with the regulations of our Institutional Review Board The study population included 5,319 lung transpalnt patients aged 18 years and older between January 1 2005 and December 31 2009 Patients were monitored from the date of transplantation to January 3 2011 which was the last day of follow-up provided by UNOS 62 predictor attributes were assessed The primary outcome variable was 1-year posttransplant survival We omit the details of all the input 62 attributes here due to space constraints A brief description of the selected subset 12 attributes used in the nal model is presented later Out of 5,319 patients 1,061 patients 19.95 did not survive more than 1 year after transplant 3 


IV E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS We used the WEKA toolkit 3.6.7 for the implementation of data mining techniques described earlier 3-fold cross-validation was used for evaluation Cross-validation is routinely used to evaluate the prediction performance of data mining models to eliminate any chances of over-ìtting In k fold cross-validation the input data is randomly divided into k segments k  1 segments are used to build the model and the remaining 1 segment unseen by the model is used to test/evaluate it This is repeated k times with different test segments and the results are aggregrated In this way each instance of the dataset is run through a model that has not seen it during the training phase Running a test instance through a trained model generates a probability distribution for that instance to belong to different possible class values here binary 1-year survival A probability cutoff is required to actually classify the test instance into one of the classes For binary classiìcation 50 cutoff is most commonly used A Evaluation metrics Binary classiìcation performance can be evaluated using various metrics We use the following in this work 1 c-statistic AUC  The ROC Receiver operating characteristic curve is a graphical plot of true positive rate and false positive rate The area under the ROC curve AUC or c-statistic is an effective metric for evaluating binary classiìcation performance as it is independent of the probability cutoff and measures the discrimination power of the model This is the primary metric used in this work for inter-model comparison 2 Overall accuracy  It is the percentage of predictions that are correct For highly unbalanced classes where the minority class is the class of interest overall accuracy by itself may not be a very useful indicator of classiìcation performance since even a trivial classiìer that simply predicts the majority class would give high values of overall accuracy Overall accuracy   TP  TN    TP  TN  FP  FN  where TP is the number of true positives hits TN is number of true negatives correct rejections FP is number of false positives false alarms and FN is number of false negatives misses 3 Sensitivity Recall  It is the percentage of positive labeled records that were predicted positive Recall measures the completeness of the positive predictions Sensitivity  TP  TP  FN  4 Speciìcity  It is the percentage of negative labeled records that were predicted negative thus measuring the completeness of the negative predictions Specif icity  TN  TN  FP  5 Positive predictive value Precision  It is the percentage of positive predictions that are correct Precision measures the correctness of positive predictions P ositive predictive value  TP  TP  FP  6 Negative predictive value  It is the percentage of negative predictions that are correct thereby measuring the correctness of negative predictions N egative predictive value  TN  TN  FN  7 F-measure  It is in general possible to have either good precision or good recall at the cost of the other and F-measure combines the two measures in a single metric by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall F  measure  2 precision.recall  precision  recall  B Modeling and Feature Selection As mentioned before we used 47 classiìcation schemes on this data Fig 1 present the results on 15 classiìcation schemes for 1-year survival consisting of most of the popular classiìers For each of the ensembling techniques many underlying classìers were tried in the experiments but only the one with the best c-statistic is preented in the gure Blue bars represent the c-statistic with the entire set of 62 attributes and red bars represent the results with the reduced set after feature selection Using correlation based feature selection CFS technique yielded a subset of only 12 features for the given outcome of 1-year survival The gures clearly show that many of the evaluated classiìcation schemes perform comparably well for 1-year survival Of all the models used in this study Rotation Forest with Alternate Decision Trees as the underlying classiìer gave the best c-statistic of 0.677 with 62 attributes and of 0.680 with 12 attributes Thus feature selection techniques were able to identify a much smaller subset without a loss in c-statistic Figure 2 presents the relative predictive power of the resulting smaller subset of attributes identiìed by CFS for 1-year survival Following is a brief description of these 12 attributes 1 Ability to perform daily activities  Functional status is an individualês ability to perform normal daily activities required to meet basic needs fulìll usual roles and maintain health and well-being Decline in functional status is measured by an individualês loss of independence in activities of daily living ADLs over a period of time 4

2 ICU at transplant  It represents whether the patient was in Intensive Care Unit at the time of transplant Intensive Care Units cater to patients with the lifethreatening conditions that require close monitoring and support in order to maintain normal bodily functions 3 Hospitalized at transplant  It represents whether the patient was already hospitalized when transplantation was done In general patients who are already in hospital tend to have lot of existing complications infections limited mobility etc which increases the risks of complications in addition to reducing the chance of successful outcomes 4 Lung Allocation Score at transplant  The lung allocation score LAS is a numerical value used by UNOS to assign relative priority for distributing donated lungs for transplantation within the US It takes into account various measures of a patientês health in order to direct donated organs towards the patients who would best beneìt from a lung transplant  This attrib ute represents the lung allocation score at the time of translplant 5 Lung Allocation Score at Listing  Patients who are determined to be eligible for a lung transplant are placed on a waiting list This waiting list is part of a national allocation system for donor organs run by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network OPTN This attrib u te represents the lung allocation score at the time of listing 6 Intubated at transplant  Intubation refers to the insertion of a tube into an external or internal oriìce of the body for the purpose of adding or removing uids 7 GFR at transplant  Glomerular ltration rate GFR is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working Speciìcally it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny lters in the kidneys glomeruli per minute This attrib ute represents the GFR at the time of transplant 8 Previous lung transplant  It indicates whether the patient has undergone a lung transplant in the past 9 Age at transplant  The age of the patient at the time of transplant 10 ECMO at transplant  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO is an extracorporeal technique of providing both cardiac and respiratory support oxygen to patients whose heart and lungs are so severely diseased or damaged that they can no longer serve their function This is maximal life support b u t requires continuous infusion of heparin and blood circulating through large tubes that exit the body This attribute represents the ECMO at the time of transplant 11 Previous lung transplant  90 days  It indicates whether the patient has undergone a lung transplant within 90 days prior to the current transplant 12 Previous cardiac surgery  It indicates whether the patient has undergone a cardiac surgical procedure in the past Using a predicted 1-year mortality risk  50 as a cutoff the sensitivity of the nal model for predicting 1year mortality was 12 the speciìcity 98 and the Fmeasure 20 Table I summarizes the performance of the nal model comparing it to logistic regression which is the most widely used technique in healthcare informatics for predictive modeling We believe that the preliminary results obtained in this work are quite encouraging and the fact that we can significantly reduce the number of attrbutes in the model without sacriìcing accuracy motivates integration of such models in clinical decision making V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this workshop paper we present our preliminary results of data mining on UNOS data on lung transplantation outcome We evaluated nearly 50 classiìcation schemes for predicting 1-year survival after the transplant c-statistic of up to 0.68 was achieved Further feature selection techniques were able to signiìcantly reduce the number of attributes in the model incurring no cost in c-statistic We believe that the resulting models can be very useful to aid physicians in decision making by providing them with patient-speciìc risk estimations Future work includes developing more sophisticated models for the studied outcome and also exploring conditional outcome models using some post-transplant information e.g risk of 2-year mortality given that the patient has already survived 1 year after transplant and exploring the use of undersampling/oversampling to deal with unbalanced data We also plan to do similar analysis for other transplants and integrate the current and future work into healthcare and clinical decision making in practice in the form of risk calculators VI A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported in part by the following
