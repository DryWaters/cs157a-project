In this system in formation  exchange frequently and the amount of information \(data quantity continue  to expand. The model of frequent interaction between human beings between human and machine give rise to constant change in morphologies and patterns of organization. In addition, the interaction between environment and human in this era is highlighted and the environment is the “soil human beings depending on. The view that each individual is the historic and cultural individual breaks boundaries of information society a nd highlights the role as one side of interaction for the first time which affects humans and other individuals greatly and can not be ignored. The cultural, resources and geographic barriers that existed among societies in the past could not hamper the f low of information any longer and the  flow of information promotes the speed and quantity of innovation greatly. The more active rapid growth of cells in the body tissue more active the more stable is not specific to an individual within the organization f orm  In the Internet era, the concept of management is changing, as a result of which cooperative business philosophy has gone mainstream at present, the competitive relation between enterprises will continue to be diluted, while collaborative organizations similar to the supply chains, virtual enterprises will continue to emerge  In the Era of big data, the global economy is facing great challenges and the way we understand and form the society was changed either  449 2013 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing \(GrC 978-1-4799-1282-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


Faced with the feature of 21 th  contrary, P rof. Xu xusong put forward the Complexity Science management \(CSM heory The hypothesis of CSM  organization is a systematic Thinking brain means that each organization features intelligence and intelligent structure     Given the above, this paper pro poses a brand new concept of “large organization”, a new theory put forward based on CSM ideas. This paper will introduce the basic implication  theoretical framework cultural entropy reduction theory and collaboration innovation theory of the large organ ization   2 Big organization Big  organization is a  concept. It is based on  CSM  Systems  thinking1  as  the core, an intelligent structure consisting of  perspective idea platform, mode of operation, and theory  The target is providing the  organization  with w isdom  Big  organizations  understand organization  as  consisting of  three  components  element, structure and  function  Tangible  elements include  buildings  people, funds  books, computer  Intangible elements  include  reputation  recognition  organiz atio nal culture  innovation  and creativity  Structure  refers to  the links  or relationships  between elements, including both  within the organization  and  outside the organization. Link is  general  connections  by means of  Internet resources  Function  is the abili ty to achieve  goals  T he  three components with  organization form  its stock, which is the  organization's  long term accumulation  Organization in b ig  organization is a  smart  body which  is shown in Figure 1.1             Figure 1.1   Smart body  Larger  the stock  in smart body  more  powerful  the  organization is  Big  organizations  believe  that, in order to make  individuals  more powerful, we need  to increase  the stock  Approaches to increase  the stock are  D\037 enhance  the amount of  inflows  Inflows come  from  many  outside organizations and  greater environment  D have  outflows  at the same time  Outflows  go to many  outside organizations and  greater environment  D  form a loop  with s tock  inflows, and  outflows   The  proposal of big  organization  changed our  way of thinking  that is: do not  just consider issues  based on  existing  stock of organization and individuals; in order to  make the  organization  stronger  CSM system thinking   Stock   Perspective   Idea   Theory   Platform   Operation mode  450 


we  must resort to  other organizations and  environmenta l forces  that is to have  inflows  at  the same time we should also promote  other organizations  and environment to be  powerful  this is the  outflow  Only if other organizations and environment become more  powerful  organization and  individuals  can become m ore powerful  This is the organization's  wisdom  Big  organization is a smart  body  Big  organization’s  thinking  stock, inflows and outflows forming a loop, is shown in Figure 1 2                 Figure 1 2   stock  inflows, and  outflows  form a loop  Ther efore, big organization  refers to  an  organization large enough to  go beyond  national boundaries beyond  the  boundaries of  specific  industries  It  is "big  in terms of geographic boundaries, but also a transnational  organization, and  big  the in terms of c ulture and psychology. The big  means  an  organization can operate  either according to  Eastern culture  or  Western culture  The boundaries of big  organizations  are  not based on  administrative boundaries, nor are determined by upstream and downstream  relatio nship of the industry chain  They are based on  the organization’s  needs  and rely on  people's imagination  Meanwhile  organizational boundaries  and  constantly  changing, i.e., big organization has the characteristics of  no  boundaries  This feature  makes  the  flow of information  fast and convenient  and  easy to disclose and share  information   3 Intellectual structure of big organization  Big organizational intellectual structure includes five aspects: big organization’s perspective; big organization’s concept big organization’s mode of operation; big organization’s platform; big organization’s theory   3 1 Big organization’s perspective  inflow  inflow  inflow  outflow  inflow   Smart body  Stock  Environment   inflow   outflow  Smart body  Stock  inflow   outflow  Sm art body  Stock  Smart body  Stock  Smart body  Stock  inflow  inflow  inflow   outflow  451 


 Big organization’s perspective includes  D\037  Overall  perspective  based on the CSM overall theory. Overall perspective treats organizational behavior from the heterogeneity of time and space, namely: organization's constituent elements, in addition to the tangible, more attention paid to the intan gible, such as the organization's reputation recognition …; organization’s structure, in addition to connection among constituent elements within the organization, should also consider the relationship among the various connections outside the organizatio n; organization’s function, in addition to existing features, should be goal oriented and change its function, and also change the connection among elements  D D ynamic perspective  based on CSM interaction theory. Dynamic perspective treats organizational behavior from interaction among individuals within organization, interaction among organizations interaction  between organization and environment, namely: At tention should be paid to self organization which is a very important capability and will produce heterogeneity, unpredictability, and even a new organization and evolve into a new pattern of behavior; attention should be paid to the dynamics of coordinat ion with other organizations, common value upgrade; organization cannot just concern about stability, productivity but should also pay attention to adaptation, including anti aggravation and the ability to restore function  D  New  resource perspective  based on CSM new resource theory. New resource perspective treats organizational behavior from the organization’s creativity, value, especially genetic nature of resource namely: attention should be paid to intangible resource s, and creating intangible resources; focus should be on nurturing scarce and irreplaceable resource, which is valuable; focus should also be self resource genes, which is the organization's own unique, long term accumulation, the most valuable resource  P erspective of big organization wants us to focus on the really important things. This is the organization's wisdom   3 2 Big  organization’s concept  Big organization’s concept consists of: the purpose of organization’s structure is innovation organization s activities are cantered on flow of information breaking  the traditional organization’s structure; structure that encourage self running and blurring organization’s boundaries  What big organization’s concept requires us is having innovation as target, promoting structure that encourage self running, getting value promotion driven by information flow. Wisdom of organization is embodied here   3.3 Big organization’s platform  Big organization’s platform is a big organization platform ecosystem. This pla tform Ecosystem refers to a serious of close organizations form a organic system that is advantages Complementing, resource sharing, value co creating and core competency upgrading together via a platform, in form of Virtual coalition etc., and by mechani sm of linking ecosystem   Several terms within big organization platform ecosystem  are as follows  Platform  It is one of many organizations connected to the place or the environment. It can be an 452 


intermediary service organization, a web site, a multilate ral market, or even virtual  Platform ecosystem members  are including producers, suppliers, competitors and other stakeholders  Platform ecosystem composition  it is composed of a few core enterprises and numerous in between enterprises. Core enterprises are the master and cornerstone of the ecosystem. The in between enterprises are often collaborators and in a subordinate position  Big organization platform ecosystem is shown in Figure 2.1  1  Core  enterprises build platform   2. In between enterprises a re close to platform  3. Different types of enterprises all survive in platform              Figure 2.1 Big organization platform ecosystem   T he operation of big  organization platform  ecosystem  is  based on the core business   the system  leader taking  speci fic  actions  to affect  the health of  the whole ecosystem  functioning  establish and maintain a  connected  ecosystem including operation  mechanism  sharing mechanism value creation mechanism  through the platform  ecosystem  leading companies  and  their  partne rs  together  to complete   Big  organization platform  ecosystem  is a revolution  It  changes the  mode of competition  the future of  competition is not  competition  between individual enterprises but  confrontation from one  to another  platform  ecosystems  more and more  assets of enterprises  are located  outside the boundaries  The success of a single enterprise  need to rely on  others  rely on  the  platform  ecosystem it is in namely the development of  a business  bigly depends on  the organization’s  ability to conne ct  with the ecosystem   Big  organization platform  ecosystem  allows  us  to rely on  the power of  platform ecosystem  bring our  own core  competitiveness  with other  complementary strengths  together to create  a higher  value and achieve  co existence  and developmen t  This is the  organization's  wisdom    3 4 Big organization’s operation mode   Big  organization’s  operation  mode includes   Core enterprises   Inbetween enterprises  Supplier   Produce   Competitor   Other stakeholder   Website  Multilateral   Virtual platform   Gap oriented enterprises  Core enterprise s  Gap  oriented  Gap  oriented  Gap  oriented  453 


 Borderless  learning   knowledge flow  and information flow lead to  learning  behavior, learning  behavior  brings  innovation  and inte lligent  body learns  and innovates driven  by the flow of information  Clustering effect   this  cluster effect  comes from  gravity if various enterprises  The  gravitational  attraction  is mainly for the  resource reputation  culture  value  system and personal ized  authority  Big  organization’s  gravitational attraction  creates big  organization   Big  organization’s  mode of operation  learning mode  without borders  and clustering effect It is how organization learns and innovates  through knowledge  flow and informa tion flow, and  attracts  excellent resources and talents  into the organization through  gravity  This is the  organization's  wisdom   3 5 Big organization theory  Big organization  theory includes five basic theories: active management theory leading customers  and culture entropy deduction theory  negative  culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiri ng humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborating innovation stakeholders  All of these five basic theories are based on big organization’s platform  big organization platform ecosystem and its purpose is to let platform ecosystem and organizations inside more powerful   What the five basic theories of big organization really say is that we should lead customer, inspire humanity, collaborate innovation stakeholders and form a virtuous circle. It’s  the intelligence of organization  we are talking about   4 Big organization culture entropy reduction theory Big organization culture entropy reduction theory refers to such situation that the innovative abilities of enterprise \(organization individual or smart body  are enhanced when the entropy flux gained on the Platform Ecosystem of the big organization promotes the increase of negative entropy. Therefore, t he culture management of organizational culture system is a process of entropy deduction, which makes  it necessary to gain more entropy flux from the Platform ecosystem of big organization to promote the increase of culture negative entropy in organization al culture system   4 1 The significance of culture entropy change  What cultural entropy of the system revealed is the situation of effective energy in the system. As  an open system far from equilibrium , one organization exchanges energy, material and inf ormation with the environment constantly, and the cultural entropy of the organization therefore keeps changing continuously namely, cultural  entropy change. The  trends of this change will determine the direction of evolution and development of the organi zation  The change of cultural entropy includes both positive entropy change \(entropy increase\ and negative entropy change \(entropy decrease\. Positive and negative entropy change usually work together in the same system for most situation, and  accompany  with whole process of the movement in the system   4 2 Model of culture entropy change   454 


The organizational culture entropy can be displayed in formula 3.1    formula 3.1   Where Q is  the energy of various flow; V is corresponding economic value of each flow; R is a space state variable of organization which can be set to a constant; T is time variable of organization for different stages of development   The culture entropy change ca used by in a certain time interval is displayed in formula 3.2     formula 3.2   Where   ci ES  is culture entropy generated in culture system of individual organiza tion  ce ES  is entropy inflow from platform ecosystem. The difference between  ci ES  and  ce ES  is the culture entropy change in a certain time interval   When 0 c ES 000'\000\037  002  entropy inflow is greater than entropy generated within culture system of individual organization . It indicates that negative  entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction  of advanced order and more innovative in a growing up status    W hen 0 c ES 000'\000 002  entropy inflow is less than entropy generated within culture system of individual organization. It indicates that positive entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction  of recession in disorder and confusion statu s   W hen 0 c ES 000'\000 002  entropy inflow equals to entropy generated within culture system of individual organization. At this moment, the organization is in a unusual state of equilibrium under which the degree of order may either increase or decrease, and may even perish   5 Big organization collaborative innovation theory   Big organization collaborative innovation theory means coordinating innovative stakeholders Each organizational individual  innovation stakeholder  in big organization s platform ecosystem  gather innovative resources and elements effectively and realize cooperation at a higher level by breaking through the barriers between the innovation subjects and fully releasing the energy of innovative elements such as talent, capita l, information and technology  The realization of collaborative innovation is by mechanisms of recourses sharing, advantages complementation, joint inputs and risk sharing mechanisms to carry out open  collaborative  innovation, improve innovation capabiliti es and innovation efficiency, bring  customers benefits and contribute the development of whole industry. That is, taking both social effect and industrial effect into account  A collaborative innovation model is constructed in this paper      c ci ce ES ES ES 000'\000 000\020  c S f QV RT 000 455 


5 1 Parametric design of collaborative innovation model      Parametric is defined as follows 002   i P  is social effect enterprise i  brings to customers    i Q  is industrial effect enterprise i  brings to other enterprises by i nnovation     ij B is degree of innovation achievement  and innovation value sharing between enterprise i  and enterprise j If two enterprises is the supply chain relationship, the degr ee of achievement sharing is high; if there is no business dealing, the degree of achievement sharing is small, even zero   ij G is degree of innovative idea and information  of new technology sharing between enterprise i and enterpris e j If the relation between these two enterprises is direct competition, sharing degree of information ij G  is small; if enterprise i  and enterprise j  are strategic partners, sharing degree of information ij G  is high  ij 000T  is time scale difference of innovation between enterprise i  and enterprise j  ij 000T  measures how long it takes enterprise j  to finish the same innovation after enterprise i  finished it. It takes a development cycle as standard, the range of ij 000T  is 90 ij 000T 90  i 000T  is the time for enterprise  i  to innovate  i U  is status of enterprise i The value of i U  is related to industrial efficiency i Q and social efficiency  i P and is the basis for calculating i P and i Q   4.2 C ollaborative innovation model  C ollaborative innovation model  is shown  in formula 4.1     formula 4.1       Since it is difficult to calculate the direct social effect and industr ial eff ect a dummy node  i U i 000T  is set as a benchmark i n the complex network  to measure the state of the industry Node  i U i 000T  is the zero 456 


state of innovation stakeholder  node PQ It  s a balanced node Based on this, we could calculate the  node PQ Calculation process is: set different inn ovation stakeholders state i U  and j U Value of ij 000T can be get from  innovation time difference. Innovation stakeholders’ social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth Bij reflects big organization’s impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ion’s sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organization’s platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organization’s operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organization’s theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
