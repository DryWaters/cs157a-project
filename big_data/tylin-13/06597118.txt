Abstract 
The volume and complexity of data produced and analyzed in scientiìc collaborations is growing exponentially It is important to track scientiìc data-intensive analysis workîows to provide context and reproducibility as data is transformed in these collaborations Provenance addresses this need and aids scientists by providing the lineage or history of how data is generated used and modiìed Provenance has traditionally been collected at the workîow level often making it hard to capture relevant information about resource characteristics and is difìcult for users to easily incorporate in existing workîows In this paper we describe Milieu a framework focused on the 
collection of provenance for scientiìc experiments in High Performance Computing systems Our approach collects provenance in a minimally intrusive way without signiìcantly impacting the performance of the execution of scientiìc workîows We also provide delity to our provenance collection by allowing users to specify three levels of provenance collection We evaluate our framework on systems at the National Energy Research Scientiìc Computing Center NERSC and show that the overhead is less than the variation already experienced by these applications in these shared environments

I I NTRODUCTION Data volumes and complexity is growing rapidly in scientiìc collaborations For example the Large Hadron Collider LHC projects 16PB/year the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope LSST projects 6PB/year of raw data and 3PB/year of catalog data and climate scientists project collections of hundreds of exabytes are expected by 2020 As assumptions and educated guesses are used to reduce or reorganize the data sets it is necessary to capture data provenance to provide context and reproducibility Data provenance is the lineage of the data and brings a historical perspective to data products High Performance Computing HPC environments have traditionally been used for large monolithic simulations run 
ning on thousands of nodes More recently HPC systems are being used to process large volumes of data through analysis workîows It is important to track the runs and data to enable lineage tracing of experiments and data Users of HPC systems currently maintain provenance indirectly They embed timestamps or other simple descriptions within le names and/or through other manual methods Since current approaches are usually ad-hoc these methods are error-prone and do not scale to large data volumes and systems Provenance or tracking lineage of data and computation has traditionally been done in the context of workîows However provenance collection at the workîow level is not very exible to user needs and makes it difìcult to capture 
resource characteristics Additionally it is not accessible to a large number of users who rely on scripts to manage their computation and data on HPC systems Our work addresses this gap by providing a minimally intrusive light-weight provenance collection and storage system for HPC applications In this paper we present Milieu a provenance collection and storage framework Milieu as the name suggests is designed to operate in the background being minimally-intrusive and light-weight Provenance collection and query systems have been closely tied in the provenance systems so far Thus provenance collection and storage systems are designed and optimized for a range of queries anticipated and/or provenance 
queries are limited by what is available in the storage However as we scale up to large systems and data volumes it is necessary to support semi-structured provenance collection and more complex provenance analysis Milieu achieves this by operating in an envisioned tiered architecture where storage for collection and storage for analysis might be different Milieu is designed to be exible i.e support various provenance data models extensible i.e can be easily expanded to support other resource environments semi-transparent i.e user initiates provenance but instrumentation is automated and scalable i.e able to support large provenance collections on petascale systems Speciìcally the contributions of this paper are 
We present an architecture and implementation of Milieu a provenance collection and storage framework for scientiìc applications running on HPC systems We evaluate Milieu on two large systems at the National Energy Research Scientiìc Computing Center NERSC including a petascale system and show that the provenance overhead is minimal and within the normal variation experienced by the applications on the systems We present and evaluate our query interface for provenance collection and provide a framework for provenance analysis support

A Tiered Provenance System B Use Cases C Design Goals 
Overview of Provenance Collection and Analysis Framework Milieu is the rst tier where provenance data is collected in unstructured or semi-structured format The second tier is more focused on provenance analysis and appropriate storage options might be used This architecture allows us to provide the best optimized storage model for collection and speciìc analysis types Milieu the focus of our paper centers on the provenance collection aspects of this architecture Provenance is collected from HPC systems through a collection mechanism that is minimally intrusive A mixture of provenance about data products and provenance of resources and system environment are also collected The user is presented with the choice of collecting provenance from multiple levels described in more detail in Section III The amount of provenance data may vary according to the application and also the instrumentation done by the user Since provenance is captured in all forms and sizes Milieu does not store provenance in a well-structured manner prioritizing instead the ability to write the captured provenance in a fast and efìcient manner Milieu provides a way to collect all raw provenance data from the systems Provenance stored in the provenance buffer can then be queried directly or further processed and transformed into different formats and more structured provenance Associating structure with the data is left to downstream provenance systems e.g Karma or other data analysis tools e.g graph analysis or MapReduce/Apache  By separating provenance collection storage and query storage optimizations will be possible at both levels 
II O VERVIEW Figure 1 shows the envisioned architecture for provenance collection and querying for scientiìc applications We propose a tiered architecture for provenance collection and analysis where the storage for provenance collection is separated from the storage model for querying and analysis We consider two use cases for our provenance collection system The rst use case is for user job submissions In the rst case provenance needs to be tracked for data processed in job scripts that are submitted to the batch queue systems on HPC systems We need to track the job submission execution and completion so system administrators and users can track every step of the execution Additionally users often perform a myriad of data tasks on the command prompt Tasks might include data preparation for the run and moving data to archival systems Milieu is based on the following design principles Provenance systems have so far relied on structured data models that are mirrored by a relational database in the backend Provenance collection systems capture a set of records at known points in the execution cycle e.g workîow started However job scripts on HPC systems vary widely and hence it is hard to develop a strong-schema based data model Thus it is important that we support semi-structured provenance data models from different users systems and applications As we process large volumes of data high performance is critical Hence it is very important that provenance collection has minimal impact on applicationês performance Provenance collection needs to be minimally intrusive to the userês workîows It is important that provenance collection be easily initiated by the user but mostly transparent during execution Automated instrumentation of userês scripts are necessary at the scales of the workîows we aim to address In addition to automated instrumentation it is often necessary to capture userês notes or metadata Thus we need an interface that allows users to add their notes about the experiments and data either before during or after a run is over HPC applications tend to vary signiìcantly in their needs and use For example routine simulation runs might need just a base level of provenance to know jobs start and nish times and other basic characteristics of the data However some applications or use scenarios may need a higher granularity of data collected during execution Simulation sizes and data collections on HPC systems are rapidly growing In turn provenance data is also rapidly growing making it necessary to scale up provenance collection and storage mechanisms This is going to be especially true as we lead into the exascale era III M ILIEU Figure 2 shows the design of Milieu to capture and query provenance The user submits a job to a batch queue system which is then executed when resources become available The provenance instrumentation module in Milieu rst captures the original job script and stores information of the script in our data store Next it instruments the job script with provenance calls and the modiìed job script is then submitted to the queue During execution the instrumented provenance

The collection component that we have designed is responsible for the capture of provenance of job script executions and those of user sessions The provenance capture of a user session is collected in its entirety by our framework For the provenance collection we devised three levels of provenance capture First level provenance consists of basic provenance These includes information about the script the outputs of the job run basic environment about where the job was submitted and user annotations This is essentially provenance that a scientiìc user would be interested in The second level includes all of the provenance from level 1 and additionally provides more detailed resource information of the resources involved for the computation Provenance at this level are more of interests to system administrators and/or for detailed analysis of resource usage for a particular class of problems In level three we capture everything captured at level 2 with the addition of provenance in the form of detailed traces of I/O calls for commands in the job script We anticipate this level to be used rarely to collect detailed I/O information for data sets and/or debugging The collection levels in our framework are designed based on current user requirements These requirements were gathered based on discussions with our users where they are generally scientists or system administrators However we anticipate that the exact implementation of these levels might vary by deployment and resource types and Milieu is extensible to accommodate these changes The captured provenance is diverse and varied Thus the data store must be capable of supporting the storage of semistructured provenance documents In our current implementation we use MongoDB a NoSQL data store for our storage needs MongoDB is a scalable high-performance data store that is open-source and developed in C MongoDB is ideal for our needs due to its native support for semi-structured data its support for sharding MongoDB also has the capability for performing complex aggregate analysis using MapReduce through both its native MapReduce framework as well as the MongoDB-Hadoop connector that will allow rich provenance analysis tools to be developed leveraging Milieu In our system captured provenance is grouped around job IDs unique identiìers assigned by the batch queue system or le identiìers location based However each entry in the data store is not constrained by a speciìc format and may vary among different jobs or les This enables us to use a single store across possibly multiple systems and user sessions e.g job vs shell In Milieu the resulting provenance can be accessed through query interfaces that support a simple query language centered around the notion of job IDs and le names The query language is designed to abstract the underlying language used at the data store level and allows the user to query the provenance in an intuitive manner without knowing too much about how the underlying data is stored In our framework both command line and a graphical web interface is designed for different users The command line interface is meant to be used by users who are comfortable with the command line The web interface on the other hand is meant to be akin to Google of provenance collection supporting fairly openended provenance queries on the collection IV I MPLEMENTATION Our initial implementation of Milieu was built for NERSC HPC systems and we detail our implementation in this section The Milieu collection module is available to the user by loading the module for provenance Modules is a simple environment management tool used on HPC systems that allows setting up of the environment through a simple set of commands e.g module load module unload For the provenance capture from job executions the user needs to submit their job scripts via a command  which is a wrapper command around the original command part of the Portable Batch System We use a different name for the job submission so that the early users of our system are aware of their participation in the provenance Our eventual goal is to make this completely transparent to the end-users

command also takes an optional integer parameter that corresponds to the level of provenance capture akin to the levels that are speciìed in a logger When a job script passes through this wrapper the original copy of the script is kept as provenance along with other static information about the system such as the host name IP addresses user credentials and a host of other information The PBS headers of the script are also extracted parsed and stored as well An instrumented copy of the script is then forwarded to the PBS queue Listing 1 Depending on the level of provenance capture that was set by the user the script is instrumented at different granularities The instrumentation enables a range of things to be captured including the output of a job information in the PBS queue during execution to more detailed provenance such as straces of individual calls and also outputs from the Integrated Performance Monitoring IPM used at NERSC IPM is an application proìling framework that provides details such as the time spent by the application computing and communicating using MPI The more detailed level of provenance provides information about the nodes that were involved in a distributed MPI job and also more detailed information about system calls if necessary The design decision to enable provenance in various levels is driven by the provenance demands that we foresee for different users and also the exibility that allows us to conserve storage and reduce instrumentation overheads where possible In order to specify the calls that the user wants to strace the tag has to be added in front of the intended call Additional user provenance can also be captured in the form of name value pairs by adding a line in the users job scripts as shown in the listing Provenance is pushed off to storage in three stages namely pre-execution the start of execution and end of execution Once a job is submitted initial provenance about the node where the submission happens and the provenance of the PBS headers are stored Once the job is executed runtime provenance such as the execution variables nodes on which the job was distributed to and elds such as timestamps are captured Finally straces if enabled and outputs are put into les and stored right before the job is terminated This is done in stages to minimize the number of database I/O operations and to also minimize the performance impact to the actual job Provenance about a users session is collected through a wrapper that uses the shell command  Basic information about the system on which the session is initiated and the timestamps of the start and end of the session are also recorded When a user is done with their session the captured provenance is stored in a le which is then put into storage on our provenance Mongo database MongoDB We implemented our collection tools using a mixture of Python and Shell scripts In all cases the Shell scripts were used to interact at the front end since this is native in a HPC environment We group all provenance documents under a single provenance collection For a single job ID multiple provenance documents may exist in MongoDB Mandatory elds columns in the traditional sense for each document include an associated job ID user ID and timestamp Most documents contain two elds with one acting as a description and a second eld containing the value associated with that description The provenance store also has information about the systems The system information is more structured and will contain more elds such as the host name IP address user environment variables etc Thus we are able to use a single collection for different types of data

For le management we use the MongoDB GridFS speciìcation for storing the actual le contents due to its ease of use metadata and large le support GridFS uses two collections for storing data Large data objects are split into small chunks which are then stored in the collection while metadata that describes the data object is stored in the collection Milieu provides two query interfaces a command-line and b web interface that allows the user to query and make simple edits to the MongoDB provenance storage The web query interface uses Django v ersion 1.3 Our query components support basic queries such as querying for the name of a le the name of a job and any other attribute that is associated with a job or data le In both interfaces we also provide the capability for users to add annotations to the captured provenance These annotations are added to the existing provenance in the form of name value pairs Carver is an IBM iDataPlex system with 1202 compute nodes The compute nodes are a mix of 2.67GHz Intel Quadcore Nehalem processors with 24GB and 48GB of memory two six-core Westmere 2.67GHz processors with 48GB of memory and four eight-core Nehalem-EX 2.00GHz processors with 1TB of memory All nodes are connected using 4X QDR InìniBand technology Hopper is a Cray XE6 peta-îop system consisting of 6384 nodes Each node consists of 2 twelve-core AMD MagnyCours with 2.1GHz processors per node for a total of 24 cores with 64GB of memory The compute nodes are connected via a custom high-bandwidth low latency network provided by Cray in a 3D torus topology In all experimental cases we used the regular queue of the system for evaluation which is used by the users of these systems The storage and query mechanisms were hosted on a single Carver node A single MongoDB instance version 2.0.6 was deployed for storing the collected provenance along with the Django based web query interface For the evaluation of provenance collection we performed experiments using three applications from the NERSC-6 applications benchmark suite GTC MILC and PARATEC Based upon previous research these applications represent a signiìcant portion of NERSC workloads GTC short for 3D Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code is a 3dimensional particle-in-cell PIC code used to study microturbulence in magnetically conìned toroidal fusion plasmas We used version 2 of the GTC code with a large problem size that involves 66,455,552 number of grid points as input on Hopper and 2 million grid points on Carver MILC or MIMD Lattice Computation is used in part to study quantum chromodynamics QCD the theory of the subatomic strong interactions responsible for binding quarks into protons and neutrons and holding them together in the nucleus We used version 7 of the MILC code in our experiments using the extra large input lattice size of 64x64x64x144 on Hopper A smaller version using a lattice size of 32x32x16x18 with 2 quark avors four trajectories and eight steps per trajectory was used on Carver for our evaluation The PARAllel Total Energy Code PARATEC benchmark code performs quantum-mechanical total energy calculations using pseudopotentials a plane wave basis set and uses an all-band unconstrained conjugate gradient CG approach for solving Density Functional Theoryês DFT KohnSham equations The version we used is based off the NERSC6 input that contains 6 conjugate gradient iterations and only 250 atoms in a diamond lattice conìguration This input does not allow any aggregate over the transposed data The applications were executed on Carver using 8 nodes with 8 processes per node On Hopper GTC was executed using 2048 cores and MILC was executed using 4096 cores We conducted our experiments by comparing the different levels of provenance capture along with the base case of just running the application without any provenance capture For each application we perform 15 measurements without any provenance capture and also 15 measurements for each level of provenance capture levels 1Ö3 We only performed 7 Hopper measurements for each scenario since jobs are more expensive than their Carver counterparts both resource-wise and timewise All results were generated from job runs during normal production time on the NERSC machines discussed above In this subsection we discuss our results from the evaluation of three applications on two of NERSC HPC systems Hopper and Carver Each box plot shows the timings of the three levels

Carver Hopper Analysis of Overhead 
For our experiments on Carver we conclude that the overhead associated with GTC MILC and PARATEC to be insigniìcant compared to the base case with no provenance capture Based on the box plot for GTC Figure 3a we observe that the medians for all levels of provenance capture to be around 141Ö143 seconds For MILC Figure 3b we observe the same trend with the median for no provenance capture being around 210 seconds and those with provenance capture ranging from 211Ö214 seconds In the case of PARATEC Figure 3c the median without provenance capture is around 267 seconds and the ones with provenance capture having medians of 269Ö271 seconds This shows us that the provenance capture overhead is within the normal variability well within 2 that these application already experience on these systems     For GTC Figure 4a we note that the provenance capture accounts for about 22Ö28 seconds overhead of slightly over 2 Figure 4b shows the performance of MILC on Hopper with different provenance levels The same trend occurs for MILC on Hopper with an overhead of about 46Ö104 seconds 2Ö5 overhead This falls within the variability that applications experience in these environments This shows that the provenance capture mechanism minimally impacts timings of the original job runs We timed the execution of each individual script in our provenance capture module for a single job submission A total of ve scripts were timed The qsubprov shell script handles the pre-processing of the job script and invokes a qsub pc.py python script This python script handles the ingestion of provenance captured at this stage into MongoDB Similarly qsub le insert is a shell script that searches and inserts les into our provenance storage via a python script le insert.py The other script that we timed was timestamp.py which is responsible for capturing the begin and end timestamp entries Table I details the breakdown of our timings for these scripts on Hopper and Carver respectively The timings reîect the average taken from three instrumented runs on both systems The provenance capture on Hopper uses level 2 while on Carver the provenance capture used is level 3 From the results of both tables we observe that our provenance module contributes very little to the overhead of the end-to-end execution of these applications The Hopper overhead is a little higher than Carver since Carver is more directly connected to the le system server than Hopper

The rst case that we have evaluated is by observing the amount of time required to query for a regular expression job ID query by iterating through all available documents in MongoDB and returning all documents We observe that the query performance generally increases linearly as the number of documents that are being stored in the database increases This is depicted in Figure 5 We do notice that as the database scales up to approximately 10 million records the time needed to iterate through the entire database is already 200 seconds and for 25 million records it is 595 seconds Thus if there are queries that need to query all data in a database they will beneìt from a MapReduce framework that will allow scalability The second case that we looked at was the evaluation for a regular expression query of a single job ID for a MongoDB database of different sizes Figure 6 depicts the results of our evaluation The outliers in this gure are the rst queries issued against MongoDB These rst queries are retrieved and cached in memory resulting in subsequent identical queries having less signiìcant response times approximately half the response times of the rst queries As a comparison we also looked at exact queries for the same job ID For these queries the performance of the query is very fast with response times within 600Ö800 microseconds even for a large database with 24 million documents VI D ISCUSSION In this paper we have described and evaluated the design and implementation of Milieu for semi-structured provenance collection and storage on HPC systems In this section we discuss provenance quality operational challenges usability future storage and query scalability Provenance captured in Milieu is a mixture of data and process provenance and can be used for a number of use cases Our approach is useful in some cases and falls short in others We discuss the pros and cons of our captured provenance in this section The captured provenance helps the user identify with ease where data objects are stored Users can use Milieu to query the NoSQL data store using regular expressions to search previous job runs for a variety of information including data objects status etc The provenance can be used to determine if the job script terminated properly The provenance of a job script that terminates successfully contains a timestamp of when the job script terminates Faults that affected single jobs or a group of jobs can be easily identiìed with queries and/or analyses Issues with the underlying hardware or environment can be identiìed by examining the straces or the ipm log les Our current approach does not account for automatic identiìcation of input data sources Different scientiìc applications take input sources in different formats e.g xed le names on the command-line This makes it difìcult to automatically identify input sources In future work we plan to address this by prompting the scientists to indicate input data sources for the framework Additionally the captured provenance is not compatible with the OPM Open Provenance Model speciìcation since our goal is on ef cient capture in close to raw format In future work it will be important to assess the quality of provenance to ensure that the captured provenance can be used as intended The completeness and correctness of the provenance trace needs to be assessed such that captured provenance reîects unambiguous and factual events Milieu provides support for multiple levels of provenance This allows the scientist or system administrator to pick the level that is most suitable for their use case The support for user annotations allows users to capture notes and metadata that are often lost It should be noted that Milieu does not require users to make any changes to their job scripts The support for user annotations allows users to capture notes and metadata that are often lost but is not required to collect other provenance information Provenance initiation is user controlled but instrumentation is automated In our current implementation all users are stored in a single collection This optimizes the

queries by system administrators performed across users In future work we plan to provide a start-time conìguration to control per user collection if it is required in cases where the usage model might differ Additionally we operate MongoDB in a single-server mode MongoDB allows sharding that allows us to easily scale up as data grows MongoDB sharding is well-documented and evaluated and can be easily conìgured for MongoDB The big data movement has seen a number of NoSQL data stores for horizontal scalability distributed over many servers In this paper  we used Mongo database MongoDB a document-oriented data store since it was well suited for semi-structured provenance documents MongoDB is typically well suited for write-once read-many times pattern data access as is the case with Milieu The NoSQL systems are evolving rapidly and it is possible that some other data store might provide additional features and/or better performance Our architecture and methodology is not tied to the use of MongoDB and thus it will be possible to use other data stores with Milieu in the future VII R ELATED W ORK In recent years multiple provenance collection systems have been developed in the context of workîow tools e.g VisTrails K epler 13 and Pe gasus 12 More recently  we have systems such as RAMP that tar gets collecting provenance from MapReduce w orkîo ws Karma 18 is a workîow based system that supports provenance capture in semi-structured eScience environments and Provenance Aware Storage System PASS is tar geted at capturing provenance at the operating system and le system levels Gadelha Jr et al described ho w the collection and querying of provenance can help in managing large-scale scientiìc computations in their respective environments Jones et al detail a pro v enance enabled le system that automatically collections information ow provenance at the le system level with the goal of aiding scientiìc users in better organizing their data Our work captures and represents provenance from multiple layers of an application including the resources and environment on which an application is executed in the HPC environment It also captures traces for data provenance and provide the user with the ability to determine the level of delity of provenance that they want captured The novelty of our work lies in our lightweight and minimally intrusive provenance capture that also allows user delity In addition our architecture design allows captured provenance to be streamlined for speciìc use cases VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we present the design implementation and evaluation of Milieu a minimally-intrusive light-weight multi-level provenance collection storage and query framework Milieu supports the collection of semi-structured provenance data from jobs and user commands on HPC systems Our evaluation on NERSC production systems including a petascale machine shows that the collection overhead is minimal Milieu makes it possible to build a multi-tiered provenance architecture where storage for collection and storage for optimized queries can be separated A multi-tiered architecture will be able to support a wider range of provenance queries and analyses that is difìcult if not impossible today IX A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was funded by the Ofìce of Science of the U.S Department of Energy under Contract Number DE-AC0205CH11231 including use of resources at NERSC R EFERENCES  S Ahern A Shoshani K.-L Ma A Choudhary  and et al Scientiìc Discovery at the Exascale Report from the DOE ASCR 2011 Workshop on Exascale Data Management Analysis and Visualization http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/01 Exascale-ASCR-Analysis.pdf 2011  K Antypas J Shalf and H W asserman NERSC-6 W orkload Analysis and Benchmark Selection Process Technical Report LBNL-1014E Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory August 2008  S P  Callahan J Freire E Santos C E Scheide gger  C T  Silv a and H T Vo VisTrails visualization meets data management In
