Research on the Improvement of FP-growth Based on Hash  Deng Yan-gu, She Ying, Jia Wei-qiang Nanchang Hangkong University Nanchang  China syjeffdyg@163.com  Abstract FP-growth is a typical algorithm which will not generate candidate itemsets in association data mining However, in the process of building FP-tree, each node will compare with the original, which greatly affected the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the analysis of the process of building FP-tree, an optimization method based on hash was proposed in this paper, which can save more time of locating the new item by using a hash table and a hash function. The following experiment proves that the latter algorithm is better than the former one in performance Keywords-association rules; FP-growth; hash; FP-tree  I DWD0LQLQJ\f     JUDZDO ??  ???? $SULRUL   WHPVHW   SULRUL  DQ-LDZHL    DQ

0/common, 0.2/bad, 0.8/awful 0.1/excellent, 0.2/good, 0.5/common, 0.1/bad, 0.1/awful So we can get a fuzzy matrix 0 0 0 0.2 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.1 0.1 R   The comprehensive evaluation of X can be described as follows: b= aR= \(0.015, 0.03, 0.075, 0.185, 0.695 significance of X can be described as follows: d= cbT 0.1985 Commodity information and transaction records in the transaction database are described in table I and table II respectively Firstly, through scanning table II, we can compute the support of every commodity. Secondly, we compute the product of nsupport and significance of a commodity which is described in nsupportsignif column of table III Thirdly, for every item, comparing the values of nsupportsignif and MIS, if nsupportsignif ? MIS, the item is put into large itemsets. Similar to Apriori algorithm L1 is produced, and then, C2L2C3L3are produced subsequently. Finally, maximum large itemset contains {B C} and {B, E}. So association rules and their confidence can be described in table IV. Assuming minimum confidence is 60 two association rules are produced: CB and EB From the result, we can see commodity C, which has low support and high significance, is put into L2 and is contained in association rules. However, if we make use of ordinary MSM algorithm, those association rules containing C, will be missed TABLE I.  COMMODITY INFORMATION commodity No. significance MIS A 0.05 0.2 B 0.15 0.3 C 0.4 0.2 D 0.05 0.4 E 0.2 0.2

It mainly has three characters: \(1 compute significance, which can comprehensively reflect natures of item with multi-attribute; \(2 large itemset is produced, support and significance are taken into consideration at the same time, making the filter criterion more reasonable; \(3 concerned with, important items with low support will not be missed easily ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. Mao Hongbao and Dr. Xu Lei for the fruitful discussions leading to this work REFERENCES 1] Mehmed Kantardzic, Data Mining, Beijing: Tsinghua University Press, 2003 2] Wenwei Chen, Data Warehouse and Data Mining, Beijing: Posts

ALGORITHM PATIENTS BELONGS TO CLASS =NO IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this proposed study, we used preprocessing to improve the quality of data. Next we applied equal interval binning with approximate values based on medical expert advice to Pima Indian diabetes data. Than we applied apriori association rule algorithm to generate the rules. The generalization of rule may be further improved by considering the factors which influence the diabetes. But which are not included in the present study.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
