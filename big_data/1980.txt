Work in this area mainly focuses on combining several functionally different models, but some publications also deal with combining forecasts with the same functional approach. In the latter case, individual forecasts are generated by diversifying one or more model parameters or, if dealing with hierarchical data, by using forecasts from different levels. This work looks at multi-dimensional data from airline industry, with the aim of improving the forecast of cancellation rates for bookings. Three different methods are employed for the generation of individual forecasts Forecast combinations are usually implemented in a more or less static structure, either including all available forecasts or trimming a fixed percentage of the worst performing models For a big number of individual forecasts, this procedure can become inefficient. In this paper, a dynamic approach of pooling and trimming is applied to the generated forecasts for airline cancellation data I. INTRODUCTION Forecasting demand and cancellation rates for flights is a crucial part in airline revenue management. The knowledge of the point in time when it is beneficial to restrict bookings in a lower-fare class to leave space for later booking highfare customers is of both economical and ecological interest producing a higher revenue for a high-demand flight and fewer unoccupied seats in a low-demand one. In previous work [1], the combination of forecasts and especially multilevel combinations for seasonality forecasts as a part of the demand prediction have proven very successful. Similar improvements are hoped for by investigating cancellation forecasts. There are two contributions in this work: Firstly different approaches to generating individual forecasts for airline cancellation rates are investigated. Secondly, a dynamic combination approach being able to efficiently deal with the great number of individual forecasts is applied Empirical evaluations for both of these aspects is presented All experiments were carried out using booking and cancellation data for several flights obtained from Lufthansa Systems Berlin GmbH A. Time series forecasting Time series forecasting is a very active area of research. As far as individual methods are concerned, approaches based Smart Technologies Research Centre, School of Design, Engineering and Computing, Bournemouth University, Poole House, Talbot Campus Poole, BH12 5BB, UK, Phone: +44 1202 595298, Fax: +44 1202 595314 email: bgabrys@bournemouth.ac.uk Lufthansa Systems Berlin GmbH, Salzufer 8, 10587 Berlin, Germany, Phone: +49 30 34007141, Fax: +49 30 34007100, email: silvia.riedel@lhsystems.com on exponential smoothing are popular, yet simple to use methods \([2], [3 rely on complex ARIMA models and their derivatives \([4 The machine learning community mainly looks at neural networks, either using Multi-Layer-Perceptrons with timelagged time series observations as inputs as, for example, in 5] and [6], or recurrent networks with a memory, see, for example, [7]. Extensive empirical studies have been carried out, a very recent one being the M3 competition, which investigated 3003 time series. Results have been published in [3]. It seems, however, as if no method has ever proven successful across various studies and time series. This is mainly due to the fact that time series can have very diverse characteristics and underlying data generation processes which makes it impossible to design a method working well for all of them 


for all of them Traditionally, several functionally different approaches are being applied to a problem before picking the one that is most suitable. More recently however, other approaches than just using different methods have been pursued in order to try a number of different individual forecasts. One method was proposed in [8] under the name of thick modelling. The general idea here is to generate different models using the same functional approach by varying one or more parameters used in the building or forecasting process of the model. This has shown to decrease model risk and improve forecasting performance A second method can be used in applications where data is available in a hierarchical structure. In airline industry booking and cancellation numbers can be aggregated on different levels, for example for each or all points of sale or days of the week. A recent example of a publication investigating approaches to hierarchical forecasting is [9 B. Forecast combination Research in the area of combination of time series forecasts has a long track record, with the first related publication dating back to 1969. The motivation comes from the fact that all models of a real world data generation process are likely to be misspecified and picking only one of the available models is risky, especially if the data and consequently the performance of models change over time. Forecast combination is a reliable method of decreasing model risk and aims at improving forecast accuracy by exploiting the different strengths of various models while also compensating their weaknesses Usually, weighted linear combinations of forecasts with equal weights or weights that are in some way based on past 978-1-4244-2774-1/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE performance are employed \([10 models can be used \([11], [10 nonlinear forecast combination is quite sparse, which is probably due to the lack of evidence of success as stated in [10]. Quite recently, pooling algorithms have been investigated, providing the possibility of dynamically trimming bad forecasts from the ensemble and generating a more efficient combination. Aiolfi and Timmermann proposed variancebased pooling in [12], which was used in investigations done in this work This paper looks at an approach to generate an extensive pool of diverse individual forecasts by using parameter, level and functional diversification. Both traditional combination methods and a pooling approach extended to multi-level forecasts are compared. Section II looks at the diversifications using the example of airline cancellation data, section III describes the traditional combination algorithms and the pooling approach that are compared in empirical experiments in section IV. The last section concludes II. GENERATING DIVERSE INDIVIDUAL FORECASTS It is a common agreement that individual forecasts in a combination should differ from each other to produce a combination result that improves upon individual forecasts In general, it is desirable that the forecasts to be combined are as accurate as possible, while weaknesses one forecast may have should preferably be compensated by the others The concept of encompassing is investigated in [13], stating that one important characteristic of a superior individual forecast is its encompassing of rival forecasts, i.e. it includes all the information other models give. Forecasts that are encompassed by others are redundant in a combination. A recent application of this concept is given in [14 This leads to the question of how to generate a pool of diverse individual forecasts. The most natural way is using methods with different functional approaches. Examinations presented in [15] and [16] come to the conclusion that both linear and nonlinear models should be present in a forecast combination. In previous work published in [17], a 


forecast combination. In previous work published in [17], a functionally diverse method pool consisting of methods like moving average or exponential smoothing, ARIMA models and neural networks has been investigated. However, the airline booking and cancellation time series used in this work can be characterised as being very short, prone to problems related to predicting small numbers and subject to strong time restrictions as many forecasts have to be generated in a very short time. For these reasons, only simple individual methods can be applied here; namely, three different forecasts are used: single exponential smoothing Brown  s exponential smoothing and a regression approach These methods have proven to be successful in both forecast accuracy and compliance with time restrictions Individual forecasts can furthermore be diversified by thick modelling as presented in [8]. Airline cancellation forecasting at Lufthansa Systems Berlin is based on rates restricting actual rates to certain confidence limits in both the history building and the forecasting process. Preliminary experiments have shown that manipulating some parameters for confidence limit calculation, making them slimmer or wider, has a positive effect if the resulting individual forecasts are combined. Four different sets of parameter values are used to add a second dimension to the set of individual forecasts The third and last diversification method can only be applied to hierarchical data sets, who are however quite common in service and retail industry. The history for airline cancellation rate forecasts in this application is usually built on the finest possible level, which means using data collected per fareclass, day of week, point of sale and origindestination-itinerary. On this finest level, important characteristics that are only visible when looking at the bigger picture i.e. a higher aggregation level, might be lost. On the other hand, using a high level might omit characteristics specific to certain parts of the data and lead to inferior forecasts as well. Generation of forecasts based on different levels and combining the resulting individual forecast saves the forecaster from having to choose one single aggregation level for the forecasting process. In this example, forecasts are generated using data from the finest level as well as data aggregated over days of week, fareclass and compartment III. COMBINING AND POOLING FORECASTS Five different traditional forecast combination methods have been evaluated in the empirical experiments. Most of them have been introduced a long time ago, though still many researchers rely on these basic methods. Traditional combination methods include  Simple average : The available forecasts are averaged  Simple average with trimming: The forecasts are averaged as well, but only the best 80% are taken into account  Outperformance model: Weights for a linear combination are assigned based on the number of times a forecast performed best in the past [18  Variance-based model: Weights are assigned in relation to past error variance [19  Optimal model: Weights are calculated according to 20], taking covariance information into account All of the methods have strengths and weaknesses as reviewed in [21]. The simple average with and without trimming has the reputation of being notoriously hard to beat. The outperformance model, only rewarding methods performing best at a given point of time, omits all relative performances in its weight calculation. Only the optimal model takes covariance information of the individual forecasts into account, which is regarded as unstable especially if the number of forecasts is high in relation to the available forecasts as stated in many publications, for example in [20 and [12 Relatively recently, Aiolfi and Timmermann introduced 


Relatively recently, Aiolfi and Timmermann introduced conditional combination strategies in [12]. Following empirical results saying that a good or bad performing forecast is more likely to keep performing well or badly instead of changing its performance, they group a number of forecasts that are diversified in functional approach and model parameters in two or three clusters using a k-means algorithm on their past error variance. Forecasts are then pooled within the groups before combining them with one of the following strategies  selecting the previously best performing cluster and averaging the forecasts contained in it  excluding the cluster that performs worse and averaging forecasts from the other clusters  combining forecast averages of each of the clusters using least squares regression or  doing the same as in the previous approach but shrink weights towards equal weights In this work, the second approach has been investigated using three and four clusters. The combination method used for obtaining one forecast per pool is the simple average with trimming. Past experiments have shown that if the number of forecasts in a cluster exceeds five, it is useful to dismiss the worst performing ones IV. EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION The data set investigated comprises 63 weeks of booking and cancellation data for 16 Origin-DestinationOpportunities \(ODOs an origin and destination airport. Eleven of the flights take place within Europe, five of them are intercontinental ones From the 63 available weeks, the first 28 are used as an initial period for history building for the individual models The first 54 weeks are then used for learning forecast combination weights. Yearly seasonality is not accounted for in the cancellation rate forecasting process, as it is included in the booking forecasts. Out-of-sample error calculation takes place over the last ten weeks. The error measure used is the mean absolute deviation of the forecasted and the actual net booking numbers. The forecasted net bookings are calculated by the difference of the booking forecast and the absolute forecasted cancellation numbers in their unconstrained version, which means that all influences resulting from booking classes being closed for various reasons have been removed. The booking forecast is obtained using a single established method to assess the impact of the cancellation rates only. Forecasts are made for final booking and cancellation numbers on the finest possible level at 22 precedent data collection points \(DCPs spans before departure. Errors are aggregated over point of sale and fareclass by simply adding them up to obtain a high level view, which the given result numbers are based on. Result tables in this section give numbers that represent the relative improvement compared to the best individual forecast for each of the DCPs the best individual forecast being determined dynamically for each DCP. Three sets of experiments are carried out, which are described in more detail in the next sections A. Ordinary combinations As mentioned in the introduction, the most widely used combination types are combinations of functionally different forecasts. The three different individual models, single exponential smoothing, Brown  s exponential smoothing and regression, have been combined with the five traditional combination models presented in section III Fig. 1. Sketch of a combination of three forecasting methods A sketch of this procedure can be found in Figure 1. The pooling approach has been omitted for this experiment as well as the next one, as the number of three forecasts is too small to be organised in three or four clusters As shown in Table I, each forecast combination fails to outperform the best individual method on average. The most 


outperform the best individual method on average. The most stable method, the outperformance model, only improves upon the best individual method at six out of the 22 data collection points. The best case here is an improvement of 2.5%, while the worst case deteriorates performance by 4.2 The basic experiments show that the simple combination of three functionally different individual forecasts does not improve performance when applied to airline cancellation forecasting. Reasons for that can be the small number of individual forecasts and their correlation, as combinations do generally not improve performance if input forecasts are too similar. The next two experiments investigate other methods of extending the pool and the diversity of available input forecasts B. Adding parameter diversified forecasts In this experiment, the pool of forecasts is generated as depicted in Figure 2. Each of the three forecasting methods is built in four different ways, by diversifying a parameter set for calculating confidence limits in each of the forecasting processes Table II shows small improvements compared to the previous experiment, especially for the simple average with trimming, the outperformance model and the variance-based TABLE I RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN % OF FIVE FORECAST COMBINATION MODELS \(SIMPLE AVERAGE \(AVG SAT OUTP VAR OPTIMAL \(OPT PERFORMANCE IS GIVEN FOR 22 DATA COLLECTION POINTS \(DCP DCP AVG SAT OUTP VAR OPT 0 -12.413 -12.413 -0.964 -11.157 -8.447 1 -0.164 -0.164 -1.281 -0.297 -4.835 2 1.951 1.951 0.093 1.858 4.348 3 3.493 3.493 2.502 3.566 3.346 4 1.823 1.823 2.112 2.022 1.637 5 0.233 0.233 1.119 0.886 -0.265 6 -0.718 -0.718 0.311 -0.005 -4.002 7 -1.141 -1.141 0.025 -0.271 -6.185 8 -1.904 -1.904 -0.261 -0.873 -5.307 9 -3.049 -3.049 -1.146 -1.852 -9.838 10 -4.433 -4.433 -1.795 -2.912 -7.265 11 -4.954 -4.954 -1.954 -2.870 -6.559 12 -5.139 -5.139 -2.207 -2.960 -5.535 13 -5.073 -5.073 -2.214 -3.253 -4.577 14 -6.836 -6.836 -3.183 -4.952 -4.730 15 -7.601 -7.601 -3.213 -5.596 -5.364 16 -7.857 -7.857 -4.228 -6.740 -9.290 17 -6.550 -6.550 -3.808 -5.549 -8.606 18 -5.517 -5.517 -3.776 -4.972 -7.916 19 -4.660 -4.660 -3.548 -4.331 -8.733 20 -3.587 -3.587 -2.534 -3.264 -6.241 21 -1.977 -1.977 -1.621 -1.800 -8.783 average -3.458 -3.458 -1.435 -2.515 -5.143 minimum -12.413 -12.413 -4.228 -11.157 -9.838 maximum 3.493 3.493 2.502 3.566 4.348 approach. The first two of them are now able to outperform the best individual method at 13 of the 22 data collection points. Mainly due to a performance outlier at the first data collection point however, the overall improvement is still negative, if only slightly The results of this experiment show that all of the combination methods were able to improve their average performance and increase the number of data collection points at which individual methods were outperformed. However methods still suffer from negative performance outliers especially at the early DCPs and there are still many cases where performance gets worse C. Adding the level dimension Encouraged by the small improvements using parameter diversification, two more diversification dimensions are now added, exploiting the hierarchical nature of the airline data 


in this application. In addition to the functionally different forecasts using diversified parameters for their forecasting processes, forecasts are now also generated on the basis of the data aggregated over day of week and compartment as indicated in Figure 3. The sets of different parameters have been reduced to two for this experiment to reduce computational effort Because of the larger number of individual forecasts generated, the variance-based pooling approach described in section III has been employed in addition to the five traditional combination methods.

The best traditional models, the outperformance and the variance-based model, outperform the best individual method at 21 out of 22 data collection points with improvements of up to 33.5%. The outstanding method however is the variance-based pooling, with three and with four clusters Fig. 3. Sketch of a combination of three forecasting methods, with additionally diversifying model parameters and learning levels Both methods achieve improvements of up to 37%, outperforming all other combination methods at every single data collection point. Even in the worst case, improvements for this method amount to 2%. On average, the performance of both pooling methods is quite similar Exploiting information from higher data aggregation levels to generate a bigger pool of individual models leads to significant improvements in the cancellation forecast delivered by traditional combining models, however, at few DCPs performance is still worse than that of the best individual model. The extremely good results of the dynamic pooling approach, which always outperforms individual forecasts in this experiment, shows that the extension of this approach to hierarchical data was successful V. ANALYSING VARIANCE-BASED POOLING The variance-based pooling approach excluded a dynamic number of forecasts from each generated structure. With 


number of forecasts from each generated structure. With regards to the application, it is interesting to analyse how often which individual methods got excluded. This is shown in Table IV. For example, the first cell to the top left means that a forecast using exponential smoothing \(m1 set one \(p1 l1 c1 best structures One thing that becomes clear in the table is that forecasts being calculated on the low levels are being excluded most frequently \(first column fourth column indicates that higher level forecasts perform better than the low level ones.

The best performing cluster contains four methods, which were combined using a simple average to obtain the first input for the final combination. The second cluster contains eight methods. Since this number exceeds the maximum allowed number of five individual forecasts per combination, the worst performing 3 ones are trimmed before averaging the remaining five to obtain the second 


before averaging the remaining five to obtain the second input for the final combination. The third cluster contains the twelve worst performing forecast of the method pool and is discarded completely; the remaining two pooled forecasts are averaged In the experimental results presented in the previous section, it can clearly be seen that adding forecasts diversified by the level of their calculation to the pool of individual Fig. 4. One generated pooling structure, using three clusters. The worst performing cluster is discarded forecasts is very beneficial. However, it can also be seen that the variance-based pooling significantly outperforms the other combination approaches. Two reasons for this success can be given. Firstly, as opposed to all other methods, the number of forecasts included in the combination is determined dynamically for each problem by generating clusters and omitting the worst one. If using the simple average with trimming, the cutoff point is arbitrary and could exclude a method with a performance very similar to one retained for the combination. The other methods try to make use of all available forecasts, regardless of how bad they might be The average number of forecasts included in a combination based on variance-based pooling is 17.4, ranging from 15.5 to 19.0 for different flights. Simple average with 80% trimming would statically include 19.2 methods in a combination The second reason for the superior performance can be attributed to inner cluster weights. In the three-cluster-scenario the pooled forecasts of the two best performing clusters would get weights of 12 each, in the four-cluster-scenario the three best performing clusters would get weights of 13 This is not related to the number of methods in each cluster which can range from one to five in the algorithm used here The weight assigned to a cluster is then distributed evenly meaning it has to be divided by the number of forecasts in the cluster. Considering the example above, each of the nine forecasts included in the combination would get a weight of 1 9 in a simple average combination. With the variance-based pooling however, the forecasts of the first cluster would get increased weights of 18 each, while the five forecasts of the second cluster would decrease their weights to 110 each as depicted in Figure 5 Keeping in mind that one cluster contains forecasts with similar performance and information, a bigger group of forecasts agreeing with each other is consequently punished and looses weight in favour of forecasts grouped in smaller clusters. In this way, the pooling approach can ensure a better balance in the combination by taking interaction and similarity of forecasts into account when calculating weights Fig. 5. Combination weights for a generated pooling structure using three clusters, left: simple average, right: variance-based pooling VI. CONCLUSION This work investigated time series forecasting and forecast combinations applied to airline cancellation data. Experiments combining three different methods did not improve forecasting performance, on the contrary, performance gets worse compared to the best individual forecast. Therefore diversification procedures for generating a larger pool of input forecasts have been investigated. Generating more forecasts by parameter diversification slightly improved results still without a robust performance gain. However, additional generation of forecasts on different aggregation levels of the data before combining resulted in a significant reliable performance gain; in the best case improvements of up to 37% compared to the best individual forecast could be achieved In general, it was shown that parameter and level diversification procedures can make forecast combinations successful, even if the basic combination of functionally different forecasts is not very promising due to high correlation values and a small number of applicable methods. It was furthermore shown that the variance-based pooling approach 


furthermore shown that the variance-based pooling approach proposed by Aiolfi and Timmermann can successfully be extended to using input forecasts from multiple levels and thus is an astonishingly useful method when dealing with hierarchical data. Reasons for the superior performance have been discussed and are related to better exploiting disagreement of individual forecasts and the dynamic number of forecasts included in a combination structure The investigation of the variance-based pooling approach was not exhaustive, more numbers of clusters as well as other outer- and inner-cluster combination methods could still be evaluated. Future work will also look at dynamically evolving combination structures for cancellation forecasting as previously done for seasonality forecasts \([22 REFERENCES 1] S.

Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2.

The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
