With the amount of data gro wing constantly and exponentially, the industry has 
encountered an unprecedented challenge of efficiently and rel iably processing a tremendous amount of data. High performance computer has played a major role in the field of big data processing for its serious computational power and super-lar ge storage. However, it remains some inevitable drawbacks to efficiently utilize the HPC elatively lower availabili ty and usability. We propose to implement MapReduce fr amework on HPC to solve above problems and extensively expand the application field of HPC. We design a workable plan to deploy Hadoop on HPC with a Lustre file system, and tune Lustre to a better performance based on the nature of data access in Hadoop. Virtual memory disk is proposed to efficiently buffer temporary data and store 
intermediate data. By takin g advantage of high-speed interconnect system of HPC, the intermediate data can be transferred efficiently from map task to reduce task, which cannot be achieved in a Hadoop system on server cluster since the rate of data flow is bounded by the bandwidth of low-speed network, such as Ethernet. Th e evaluation driven by the standard benchmarks provided in Hadoop package shows that after applying the proposed optimization method, the Hadoop system on HPC gets better performance than Hadoop system on server cluster, especially when handle data-intensive applications 
I I NTRODUCTION As there is a dramatic growth in the volumes of data analyzed nowadays, the industry calls for scalable and reliable means to handle big data High pe rformance computers have been widely used to run extreme 
ly data-intensive applications ranging from scientific comput ing to petroleum seismic exploration and bio-genetic area etc High performance computer has some inevitable draw backs while handling big data even though, including 
Sustained running of applications can not be guara nteed as the mean time between failures \(MTBF\m is getting shorter when the system evolves to be larger and more complex Checkpoint is the most popular and mature mechanism of fault tolerance in HPC, but its overhead is becom ing unacceptable in ultra large system T he problem of reli ability and availability in HPC

Programmers develop application s on HPC with parallel programming models, nam ely MPI, PVM and OpenMP These models increase the difficulty of programming by making programmers handle every single detail of communication and synchronization Lower level of abstraction of the programming model causes worse readability, maintainability and extensi Recent trends in the area of science and industry show that MapReduce framework has beco me an efficient and reliable scheme to handle big data. It is an elegant programming model which allows the programmer to focus more on

is highly concerned  
what 
than on by raising the level of abstraction Programmers specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the unde rlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the com putation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles m achine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks  It is our intent here to im prove the usability and reliability of high performance computer by efficiently deploying MapReduce framework on it, so that the application on HPC can be developed easily and run stably. Meanwhile MapReduce applications can 
 how 
get better performance by taking good use of the high-speed interconnect system in HPC. As this can expand the area of application and thus increase the utilization of supercomputer it is helpful for the survival and thriven of supercomputing centers II C HALLENGE The architecture of a HPC system can be distinguished into massively parallel processers \(MPP nd cluster, between which the main difference in the modern sense is that in a MPP system computing un its are not equipped with local storage. Because MapReduce was originally designed for clusters of commodity m achines, our major theme in research is deploying MapReduce fram ework on a MPP system instead of a cluster system 
The main components of a MPP system are computing units, high-speed interconnect system and shared storage system. As mentioned above, Ma pReduce framework is not compatible with shared storage system and thus can not be directly deployed on a MPP syst em. Running MapReduce applications on HPC is still a challenge The performance advantage of MapReduce framework lies in the strategy of moving computat ion to data A computation requested by an application is much more efficient if it is executed near the data it operates on. This is especially true when the size of the data set is huge. This minimizes network congestion and increases the overall throughput of the system

But in a MPP system all the data are stored in the shared storage so large amounts of data must be moved towards computing units. Concurrent data accesses from all nodes in the system require that the shared storage system is able to cope with a large number of acce ss requests at the same time Data access has become the most time-consuming part of a data-intensive application Even if we implement MapReduce framework on the system, the application can not avoid the I/O bottleneck of the sh ared storage system Our proposed work plans on implementing and optimizing the MapReduce framework on HPC by taking advantages of its features of high-speed interconnect and shared storage III P ROPOSED S OLUTION In this section, we intend to implement Hadoop on a high performance computer with Lustre file system, as Hadoop is the most popular open source implementation of MapReduce and Lustre is the most widely adopted file system in HPC There are two primary compone nts at the core of Apache Hadoop: the MapReduce parall el processing framework and the Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS tolerant and self-healing distributed file system designed to turn a cluster of industry stand ard servers into a massively scalable pool of storage, which means HDFS can not be directly deployed on the shared file system But since the compute nodes are equivalent to have independent storage when we assign different directories of Lustre to them, we can exploit HDFS to turn these di rectories into a pool of storage on which the MapReduce fra mework can run There are some possibilities for optimization in the Hadoop system based on Lustre due to its characteristic of shared data reading. Though MapReduce framework always assign tasks to the nodes where the input data are stored, an idle node needs to copy unprocessed data from other nodes in order to accept new tasks. In such cas e, data must be copied among the nodes But In Hadoop system based on Lustre, as tasks theoretically can locally fetch the data of any node, the data copy is unnecessary. So we designed a scheme to avoid the unnecessary copy of data Hadoop provides a stand-alone mode for programmers to develop and debug their applic ations. In this mode Hadoop runs on one single node an d all the processes are running on one local JVM. Like in HPC, the data of different tasks are stored on a shared storage The difference between them is that in stand-alone mode any task can locally access any data on the storage Because of this, we modified the underlying mechanism of Hadoop and incorporated some aspects of the stand-alone mode to avoid such data copy between nodes Unlike the stand-alone mode, nodes in Hadoop have their own JobTrakcker or TaskTracke r daemons that comprise the MapReduce framework The Na meNode and the DataNode daemons are eliminated from our modified Hadoop and the MapReduce framework runs on Lustre file system instead of HDFS For reliability, file data is sim ply replicated to multiple storage nodes in HDFS. As long as at least one replica of a data chunk is available, the consumer of that data will not know of storage server failures [4  he replication schem e also contributes to improvi ng the load balance of nodes. When the node that contains some data chunk is busy, the task can be assigned to another node which has a copy of that data chunk. We abolished this re plication scheme in our modified Hadoop. Because in a Hadoop system based on Lustre the reliability is supported by Lustre the data replication is too expensive and no longer needed. An idle node can accept any task since tasks on it can loca lly access any i nput data. Overall the replication scheme is no longer e ffective in our modified Hadoop system A Lustre file system has three major functional units clients that access and use da ta, metadata server \(MDS\that stores namespace metadata, and object storage server \(OSS that store file data on one or more object storage targets OSTs\ain factors leading to the high performance of Lustre file systems is the ability to stripe data over multiple OSTs A fi le can be striped over as many OSTs as it takes to achieve peak aggregate bandwidth of these OSTs. Multiple clients can conc urrently and ef ficiently access large files on Lustre by file striping A MapReduce application would be divided into thousands of map and reduce tasks running in parallel in a large Hadoop system. Every time a task accesse s a file it needs to interact with multiple OSTs since the file are striped over multiple OSTs and each OST has one unique part of the file. Large numbers of simultaneous task s generate large numbers of concurrent access requests. The average number of access requests that an OST need processes simultaneously is on the same order of magnitude as the number of tasks running in the system. As shown in Fig. 1 multiple tasks fiercely competing for limited OSTs cau ses I/O bottlenecks 
A Deploying Hadoop B Tuning Lustre 
Fig. 1  File striping causes fierce competition of OSTs After analyzing the data flow through each process of MapReduce framework, we find that each file is accessed by at most one task at the sam e time. There is no performance advantage to stipe file for concurrent accessing. Inspired by commodity servers with local storag e, we propose to match compute nodes with indepe ndent OSTs. Fig. 2 shows that tasks hold data only in their assigned OSTs. Data are not stripped because no file is stored across multiple OSTs Though the number of nodes far outstrips the number of OSTs and one OST can be assigned to several nodes, the competition of OSTs declines sharply and high throughput of data is achieved by handling data this way

Fig. 2  Tasks hold data in independent OSTs When the new scheme was deplo yed, the results of actual application indicated that t he performance of Lustre had a certain extent of enhancement. And we discovered some potential of optimization w hen we benchmark the scheme There are some imbalances in OST load since the MapReduce framework cannot achieve the absolutely equal distribution of tasks. Particularly at the end of map and reduce phase, some nodes are busy processing tasks while others are idle for there are no more tasks to be proce ssed. Therefore we reconfigured the Lustre and distributed all the fi les randomly over all the OSTs, as shown in Fig. 3 The number of access requests of OSTs is not increased when com pared with Fig. 2 since files are not stripped Fig. 3  Distribute unstripped files over multiple OSTs The comparison of the three different configuration of Lustre is shown in Table 1 TABLE I D IFFERENCES A MONG 3L USTRE C ONFIGURATION Fig. 4  Minimize the buffer size and turn the free memory into a virtual memory disk Temporary data spilled out from buffer can be directly written to the VMD. Map ta sk reads temporary data from VMD to generate intermediate data, and in the end the intermediate data are written to VMD though buffer. Because all those operations take place in memory, it is much more efficient than writing temp orary and intermediate data to storage Another transformative advantage of using VMD is that it increases the bandwidth of data fl ow from map task to reduce task. Fig. 5 shows the path of data flow in Hadoop on a server cluster. Network has become a scarce resource on a large server cluster since the servers are connected by commodity network, for instance, gigabi t Ethernet. Intermediate data are written to disk and transferre d over low-speed network from map task to reduce task In a Hadoop system on HPC, we replaced the disk with VMD low-speed network with highspeed interconnect system in the path of data flow, as shown in Fig. 6. It can achieve high transfer bandwidth since the speed of VMD and interconnect system is matched with the speed of memory. This enhancement Fig. 5  Path of data flow in a Hadoop system on server cluster  Fig. 6  Path of data flow in a Hadoop system on HPC Because the intermediate data are continually produced and consumed, and the temporary data are resided in memory for short time intervals the limited capacity of VMD is sufficient in most case. In response to the condition of occasional insufficient storage space in VMD, we redirect the temporary

In the shuffle phase of Hado op, the map tasks continuously produce intermediate data on the storage and the data needs to get copied over to the nodes on which the reduce tasks are going to run in order to co nsume the output of the map tasks The copy phase can not be omit ted even if reduce task can directly fetch the data on Lustre because reduce tasks would start to merge data from different map tasks while copying them to local memory The map and reduce tasks do not directly write to the storage rathe r they take advantage of buffering the writes. Each task has a circular memory buffer and when the buffer is filled up to a certain threshold, a separate thread gets triggered which spills the content in the buffer to the storage At the end of processing most data spilled to the storage need to be read back to memory again sorted and merged into larger files It is obvious that increasing the size of task buffer would reduce the number of I/O operations. It would enhance the performance especially when t he bottleneck is tied to memory/storage bandwidth. Our idea of optimization comes from increasing buffer size, but is more of it Since the memory in a node are precisely allocated to TaskTracker, map tasks and reduce tasks, there are memory quotas for each task. When the number of tasks running on the node decreases and some memo ry are released a task cannot take use of the free memory in the node. To utilize the wasted memory caused by separated buffer, we propose to create a big unified buffer to cache the temporary and intermediate data. Fig. 4 shows that we minimize the buffer size of tasks and utilize the free memory to create a big virtual memory disk \(VMD achieved by increasing task buffer, since intermediate data are not saved in the buffer

Benchmark Input data Intermediate data Output data WordCount 200 GB 27 GB 5 GB TeraSort 200 GB 200 GB 200 GB BigMapOutput 200 GB 600 GB 200 GB WordCount is a typical MapRedu ce application that counts the frequency of each word in the input files. The output data size of WordCount is rather small compared with the input data TeraSort sorts the unordered larg e volumes of data and its data size changes little in the 3 different phases. It is widely used to benchmark the performance of different systems TeraSort is a basic operation because large sorts need to be done daily in enterpr ise application BigMapOutput is designed to test the performance of Hadoop system when map tasks generate large amount of intermediate data. The program's functi onality is to transform the data three times as big and then shrink it to its original size Data size ClusterHadoop HPCHadoop write MB/s read MB/s write MB/s read MB/s 
and intermediate data of tasks to Lustre when VMD is filled up to a certain thresho ld. Hadoop uses a round robin manner to allocate a file system path for a new data block, and the path is appointed in mapred.local.di r in the configuration. We add both VMD and Lustre directory to the configuration. The allocation strategy of paths is modified to make the VMD directory be used in preference to Lustre in most case and Lustre is preferred when VMD is running out of space This way, Lustre file system is ma inly used to read input of map tasks and write output of reduce tasks. It can significantly accelerate the data flow from map task to reduce task while alleviating the I/O stress of Lustre IV E VALUATION In this section, we evaluate the proposed scheme of deploying and optimizing Hadoop on high performance computer system Our experiments were performed on TH-1A supercomputer at China's National Supercompu ting Center in Tianjin. We used 60 compute nodes, each of which has Intel Xeon X5670 CPU \(6 cores, 2.93 GHz\nd 24 GB of RAM. TH Express-1 interconnects the compute nodes with the Lustre file system The bidirectional bandwidth of TH Express-1 measured by Iperf is 15.5 Gbit/sec. The Lus tre we used consists of 1 MDS and 10 OSTs each OST has 16 Seagate enterprise-class disks 2 TB\and 12 GB of RAM. We al so conducted an experiment on a partition of TH-1A syst em where the compute nodes are equipped with local disks and interconnected by a gigabit Ethernet. The number of comput e nodes we used is also 60 The bidirectional bandwidth of Ethernet measured by Iperf is 934 Mbit/sec. We deployed a Hado op system in this partition to compare its performance with the Hadoop system on Lustre We chose 3 benchmark programs provided in Hadoop software package: WordCount TeraSort and BigMapOutput Table 2 shows the data sizes of the 3 programs in different phases when processing 200 GB input data TABLE II T HE D ATA S IZES OF 3B ENCHMARK P ROGRAMS IN D IFFERENT P HASES The source code of Hadoop is modified and recompiled to implement the proposed solution We set up a Hadoop system on TH-1A by installing the modi fied Hadoop on it. In order to compare and contrast the performance of the modified Hadoop system on HPC with common Hadoop system on server cluster, we also set up a Hadoop system on cluster-like partition of TH-1A, where t he compute nodes are equipped with local disks and interconnected with Gigabit Ethernet. For succinct description, the Hadoop system on HPC is abbreviated as HPCHadoop and the Hadoop system on server clusters is abbreviated as ClusterHadoop in the remainder of this article The TestDFSIO benchmark is a rea d and write test for the underlying file system of Hadoop provided in Hadoop package. It is helpful for tasks to stress test the file system and to discover the performance bottleneck s. It can give a first impression of how fast the Hadoop system is in terms of I/O We run the TestDFSIO benchmark on both of the HPCHadoop ClusterHadoop. Ta ble 3 shows the average I/O throughput speed of each task in different circumstances TABLE III T HE A VERAGE T HROUGHPUT S PEED OF D IFFERENT H ADOOP S YSTEM T ESTED B Y T EST DFSIO In ClusterHadoop, data blocks are replicated to 3 different nodes. When writing a data blo ck to a node, the copies of the block need to be transferred to another 2 nodes by the node it firstly written to. The writ e performance of HDFS is restricted by the limited bandwidth of Ethernet as the copies are transferred through it. Even thou gh we temporarily set the replication number of data block to 3 in HPCHadoop, the write performance of it outperfor ms the ClusterHadoop since the copies are transferred through high-speed interconnect system On the read test the perform ance of ClusterHadoop has a certain improvement since data are mainly read locally by tasks As the file size dec reases and the number of files increases, the performance of Hadoop system drops sharply which indicates both of the Lustre and HDFS file system are more suitable for writing and reading large files From the table we can conclude that the TestDFSIO performance of HPCHadoop and ClusterHadoop are about the same To evaluate the practical performance of HPCHadoop and ClusterHadoop, we ran the 3 ben chmark programs on them

Fig. 7  Run time of benchmarks on Clu sterHadoop and HPCHadoop Fig. 8  I/O traffic in HDFS and Lustre while running BigMapOutput As can be seen from the figure, th e run time of benchmarks on HPCHadoop is longer than t hat on ClusterHadoop, because the Lustre file system in HPC Hadoop performs poorly when processing large amount of concurr ent data accesses. Fig. 8 shows the I/O traffic measur ed by Collectl in HDFS and Lustre while running BigMapOutput. T he peak of the I/O traffic in HPCHadoop at the beginning indicates the reading process of input data. Lustre perfo rms well when handle this scale of data. During the map a nd reduce phase, tasks generate lots of small temporary files and write them to Lustre Frequent writing and reading of small files drast ically degrade the performance of Lustre. The I/O bo ttleneck of Lustre limits the overall throughput of data and thus slows down the performance of HPCHadoop Though the Hadoop system can be adapted to HPC architecture after modifying, the pe rformance of it needs to be improved for practic al applications Fig. 9  Run Time of benchmarks with different Lustre configuration Fig. 10  Run Time of benchmarks on Hadoop with bigger buffer or VMD Bigger buffer accommodates la rger amount of temporary data in memory, so it reduces the frequency of write to storage With bigger buffer, both of the ClusterHadoop and HPCHadoop have a better performance than those with smaller buffer In HPCHadoop, the use of VMD greatly enhanced the performance of benchmarks, as temporary data are mainly kept in VMD and intermediate data are transferred from VMD of map task to the VMD of reduce task through high-speed interconnect system. Fig. 11 sh ows network and I/O traffic measured by Collectl of HPCHadoop before and after applying VMD. We can se e that there is a burst of network traffic at the end of m ap phase on HPCHadoop, which demonstrates the shifting of intermediate data in VMDs through high-speed network. However  before applying VMD intermediate data must be read from the storage of map tasks

We set the number of task slots to12 in order to maximize the utilization of CPU which means each core in compute nodes runs a task. The size of input data is 100 GB. In HPCHadoop the input data of benchmarks are striped over Lustre. Fig. 7 shows the run time of benc hmarks on ClusterHadoop and HPCHadoop  We proposed 3 ways of configuring Lustre file system stripe files across all the OSTs, assign OST to nodes and randomly distribute the complete file over the OSTs. The benchmarks were run on HPCHadoop with different configuration and the results are s hown in Fig. 9. The virtual memory disk is created with tmpfs supported by Linux kernel Disabling file stripe can alleviate the competition of OSTs by decreasing the number of data accesses. OST assignment makes tasks can regard the OST as its local storage. So the HPCHadoop with OST assignment has a better performance than that with file striping. Since some tasks finished earlier than others, the assigned OSTs of these tasks get idle in such case. By randomly distributing the complete file over the Lustre without stripping, we achieved a better load balance of OSTs. Randomly Distributing files leads to higher performance than assigning OSTs as both of them have a lower competition of OSTs  To illustrate the performance im provement by unifying task buffer with VMD, we compared th is optimization method with increasing task buffer According to our analysis, VMD is only effective when supported by the high-speed interconnect system in HPC so we applied VMD on ClusterHadoop for contrast Lustre is configured to randomly distribute the files in these experiments The results are shown in Fig. 10

installing Hadoop on Lustre cant be experiments dont reveal the I/O bottleneck of Lustre 
Fig. 11 Network and I/O traffic in HPCHadoop before and after applying VMD while running BigMapOutput Fig. 12 Network and I/O traffic in ClusterHadoop and HPCHadoop after applying VMD while running BigMapOutput The results of experiments show that, by applying VMD the performance of HPCHadoop gets better than ClusterHadoop, especially when running data-intensive applications like TeraSort and BigMapOutput V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we intend to deploy MapReduce framework on high performance computer systems which are equipped with shared storage. We propose d a workable plan to install Hadoop on a HPC with Lustre file system, which averts remote read of data based on the shared data access characteristic of Lustre. Si nce the performance of Hadoop system on HPC is lim ited by the I/O bottleneck of Lustre, we studied to tune the Lustre to a better performance to accommodate Hadoop system. We also proposed to use virtual memory disk to alleviate the I/O stress of Lustre and optimize the process of transferring intermediate data. An algorithm is designed to maxim ize the utilization of virtual memory disk and handle the occasional out-of-space condition The evaluation driven by the standard benchmarks provided in Hadoop package clearly demonstrates the advantage of the proposed solution in the following two ways. First, the virtual memory disk utilizes free memo ry to store the temporary and intermediate data spilled out from buffer, which significantly reduces the frequency of disk write. Second, by taking advantage of the high-speed interco nnect system of HPC, the intermediate data can be transferr ed efficiently from virtual memory disk of map task to virtual memory disk of reduce task. By applying the proposed optimization method, the performance of Hadoop system on HPC gets better than that of Hadoop system on server clus ter, especially when handle data-intensive applications In the future, we plan to optimize the performance of Hadoop by taking advantage of the data block information in Lustre VI R ELATED W ORK There is relatively little research work appeared in present literature in this area.

which is Lustre, and the tasks cannot take advantage of the high-speed network even though data are transferred through it. So the HPCHadoop has a weak performance without applying VMD. Fig. 12 shows the difference of network and I/O traffic between Cluster Hadoop and HPCHadoop after applying VMD. As can be seen fro m the figure, the use of VMD has little effect in ClusterHadoop because the throughput of intermediate data is bounded by the bandwidth of Ethernet a useful framework for practical applications Reference deals with the above pr oblem b y using independent compute nodes to run Hadoop daemon processes It also uses hardlink to make data be read locally. Small-scale experiments show that the Hadoop based on Lustre outperforms the Hadoop based on server cluster Since the ratio of compute nodes to OSTs is relatively small Reference oys Hadoop on a large HPC environment and finds the I/O bottle neck of Lustre drastically hurt the performance of Hadoop R EFERENCES  DA Reed, C Lu, C L Mendes

environment  6  as well as the airborne imagery we ha v e presented The results are promising showing good discrimination between vehicle classes although performance is degraded by vehicle camou\037age and low resolution imagery The framework is scalable in terms of feature sets and the amount of input imagery and computationally parallelisable as model matching operations are independent However the recognition software does require attention in several areas Firstly results show that a certain amount of confusion will exist between vehicle classes particularly camou\037aged military ones A con\036dence measure is required to facilitate decision making automatic or otherwise Secondly the requirement for a tight bounding box surrounding the potential vehicle places signi\036cant demands on the preceding modules A means needs to be found to remove the impact of clutter surrounding the vehicle from degrading recognition performance the socalled 223target delineation\224 problem We also need to make more effective use of ground-sample distance information when carrying out the model selection and recognition Although we demonstrate a system addressing a small subset of possible targets the potential exists for the set of model candidates to be signi\036cantly larger Further investigation of the associated impact on classi\036cation and execution speed is required V C ONCLUSION The work described in this paper is the 036rst stage in moving from fundamental interactive video cueing aids to behaviour characterisation and anomaly detection tools that wide area persistent surveillance will demand We have demonstrated the value of ADSS in con\036guring a solution to a particular problem from component algorithms The results show de\036nite promise and there is now a clear way forward for algorithm and systems development In future we intend to exercise our framework and algorithms in an airborne trial with a very high resolution wide area motion imagery sensor This will facilitate activity monitoring over a large area and allow us to carry out complex repeated ground behavior activities for subsequent analysis A CKNOWLEDGMENT The
