But Apriori is a very slow and inefficient algorithm for very large data sets.  A modified algorithm for generating single dimensional fuzzy itemset mining find support count based on fuzzy t-norms namely intersection for finding freque nt itemset to reduces the processing time.   The propos ed method modifies the above mentioned algorithm for fast and efficient performance on large datasets. It adopts a new count-based transaction reduction and support count method for generating frequent fuzzy item set.  So it can further reduce time when compared to Apriori and above said algorithm Index Terms 227 Apriori, Fuzzy Set, Fuzzy Intersection Transaction Reduction  I  I NTRODUCTION  Data Mining is a recently emerging field, connecting the three worlds of Databases, Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. The computer age has enabled people to gather large volumes of data. Every large organization amasses data on its clients or members, and these databases tend to be enormous. The usefulness of this data is negligible if \223meaningful information\224 or \223knowledge\224 canno t be extracted from it. Data Mining answers this need  Discovering association rules from large databases have been actively pursued since it was first presented in 1993, which is a data mining task that discovers associations among items in transaction databases such as the sales data [1 ch k i n d o f  associations could be "if a set of items A occurs in a sale transaction, then another set of items B will likely also occur in the same transaction". One of the best studied models for data mining is that of association rules. This model assumes that the basic object of our interest is an item, and that data appear in the form of sets of items called transactions Association rules are \223implications\224 that relate the presence of items in transactions. The classical example is the rules extracted from the content of market baskets. Items are things we can buy in a market, and transactions are market baskets containing several items  Association rules relate the presence of items in the same basket, for example, \223every basket that contains bread contains butter\224, usually noted bread butter. The basic format of an association rule is: An association is an implication of expression of the form A B, where A and B is disjoint itemset, i.e., A 003 The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its support and confidence Support determines how often a rule is applicable to a given data set, while confidence determines how frequently items in B appear in transactions that contain A  The formal definitions of these metrics are  Support s \(A B  004 A 004 A   In general, association rule mining can be viewed as a two step processes  1. Find all frequent itemsets: By definition, each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predetermined minimum support count  2. Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets:   By definition, these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence  The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 contains related works.  Section 3 and 4 discusses about Apriori Algorithm and Prabamanieswari\222s Algorithm Section 5 elaborates the proposed Algorithm. Section 6 contains worked example. Section 7 discusses about the performance analysis of proposed algorithm compared with Apriori algorithm and Praba\222s Al gorithm. Section 8 contained conclusion II  RELATED WORKS  Agrawal proposed an algorithm, called AIS algorithm for  generating frequent itemsets. In the AIS algorithm, frequent itemsets are generated through iterations on scanning the database. The iteration terminates when no new frequent itemset is derived. After reading a transaction in the k th iteration the AIS algorithm computes the candidate k itemsets by first deriving a set of \(k 1 itemsets which contains itemsets that are both in the frequent \(k 1 itemsets and in the transaction However, Apriori algorithm has the limitation of producing a  004 A 002 B 002 B\N Confidence c \(A B  002 B 


IEEE Sponsored 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control \(ISCO\2015 large number of candidate itemsets and scanning the database too many times  Many researchers have given different approaches for improving the performance of Apriori algorithm  To mine the sequential pattern in large database, an effective pruning mechanism called depth first strategy was introduced by J. Ayres h i s s t rat e gy def i n e s t h e dat a bas e i n  v e rt i cal  bitmap format with effective support counting. For each item in the dataset, a vertical bitmap is constructed by which each data set transaction is represented as a bit. The value for items is set based on the item present in the transaction. The efficient support counting and candidate generation is obtained by partitioning the bitmap  Changsheng Zhang and Jing Ruan [3 ha ve  w o r ke d o n t he  improvement of Apriori algorithm by applying dataset reduction method and by reducing the I/O spending Changsheng and Jing Ruan have applied the modified algorithm for instituting cross selling strategies of the retail industry and to improve the sales performance  One of the novel algorithm presented by Chen.J a B I SC  Binary Item set Support Counting\which is responsible for efficient mining of frequent item set. According to this algorithm, support of all item sets in a database is derived with respect to direct supports. The context BISC transforms the database transaction into binary format. The memory consumption and the cost of support updating is minimized by integrating the two related techniques namely, one stage BISC BISC1\d two stage BISC \(BISC2\This technique is both time and space efficient because of BISC in conjunction with projection techniques that reduce the branching factor of database projection and maximum depth  Dongme Sun, Sheohue Teng [5 ha ve p r e s e nt e d a n e w  technique based on forward and reverse scan of database. It produces the frequent itemsets more efficiently if applied with certain satisfying conditions  Improved algorithm \(ABBM\ented by Hanbing Li which converted the database to a Boolean matrix.    It scanned the transaction database once, it does not produce candidate temsets, and it adopted the Boolean vector 223relational calculus\224 to discover frequent itemset. In addition it stores all transaction data in bits, so it needs less memory space and can be applied to mining large databases   Jaisree Singh e lop e d a T r an s action R e du cti on Algorithm which reduced the scanning time by cutting down unnecessary transaction records   as well as reduce the redundant generation of sub-items during pruning the candidate itemsets, which can form directly the set of frequent itemsets and eliminate candidate having a subset that is not frequent.   But it has overhead to manage the new database after every generation of L k So, there should be some approach which has very less number of scans of database  Kavitha.K opos ed an ef f i ci e n t t rans act i o n redu ct i on technique named TR-BC to mine the frequent pattern based on bitmap and class labels. The proposed approach reduces the rule generation by counting the item support and class support instead of only item support. Moreover, the database storage is compressed by using bitmap that significantly reduces the number of database scan. The rules are reduced by horizontal and vertical transaction and then finally combined rules are generated by eliminating the redundancy  Ramaraj.E[13  p r op o s e d a no ve l fr e q ue nc y i t e ms e t s  generation algorithm called TRApriori that maintained its performance even at relative low supports.

A novel combination of features like two-phased multiple partition tidlist-style processing, byte-vector representation of tidlists, and fast compression contributes a lot to the efficiency in performance.  Through experiments this algorithm is 8-19 times faster than fuzzy Apriori  Based on the current study; a novel combination of features like transaction reduction, fuzzy sets and new support c ount method  contribute a lot of efficiency in performance  III  APRIORI  ALGORITHM Apriori algorithm employs an iterative approach known as level-wise search, where k-item sets are used to explore \(k+1 item sets. First, the set of frequent 1-itemsets L 1 is found Next, L 1 is used find the set of frequent 2-itemsets L 2 Then L 2 is used to find the set of frequent 3-itemsets L 3 The method iterates like this till no more frequent k-item sets are found  A  Apriori Algorithm for FIM  Initialize: k := 1, C 1 all the 1- item sets read the database to count the support of C 1 to determine L 1  L 1 frequent 1- item sets}; k:=2; //k represents the pass number while \(L k-1 370 begin C k gen_candidate_itemsets with the given L k-1 prune\(C k  for all transactions t \200 T do increment the count of all candidates in C K that are contained in t L k All candidates in C k with minimum support k := k + 1 end Answer := U k L k   IV  A  MODIFIED  ALGORITHM  FOR  GENERATING SINGLE  DIMENSIONAL  FUZZY  ITEMSET  MINING This algorithm uses the following membership function is a mapping T   i\> {0,1}    is defined as  1  Such that if an item i, is an element of T then T i otherwise T i\, it considers all transactions.  It uses fuzzy t-norm for calculating support value, it increments the support value based on fuzzy intersection value is greater than 0.0 When finding intersection among the items, if any one item has a value 0, then it does not continues to find the intersection for the remaining items.  Therefore it reduces the time. The proposed method can further reduces the processing time using a new support value method by combining transaction reduction and fuzzy sets V  PROPOSED  ALGORITHM A  Fuzzy Item Set Strategy Property 1 The proposed algorithm uses the same membership functions as defined in \(1\ consider all transactions in the database and construct the fuzzy item set by replacing each item by  1/total   number of items purchased in a transaction.[8     2 After constructing the fuzzy itemsets database, the whole database is scanned only once and the data is compressed in the form of a Bit Array Matrix M = \(T ij  mxn The frequent patterns are then mined directly from this Matrix B  Transaction Reduction Strategy Property 2  Each value of RC column stores the corresponding number of similar rows.  If the transaction doesn\222t repeat then repetition column for the transaction is set to 1    3  Property 3  Support count of one itemset is calculated as counting each column based on its fuzzy value greater than 0.0        4  C  New Support Count Strategy Property 4  Support count of k itemsets can be got by using value in the RC column and fuzzy t-norm namely intersection        5 


IEEE Sponsored 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control \(ISCO\2015 VI  WORKED  EXAMPLE In general, a transactional database consists of a file in which each record represents a list of items purchased in a transaction.  Simply, a transaction includes a unique transaction identity number and the list of items making up the transaction.  The process is st arted from a given transactional database as shown in Table 1  TABLE I Transactional Database TID ITEMS T1 I1,I2,I5 T2 I2,I4 T3 I2,I3 T4 I1,I2,I4 T5 I1,I3 T6 I2,I3 T7 I1,I3 T8 I1,I2,I3,I5 T9 I1,I2,I3  Here the min sup is considered as 2.  The fuzzy item sets is constructed using property 1 as shown in Fig. 1  Fig.1 Fuzzy Sets    Step 1 The support count of one itemset is calculated as counting each one itemset based on its fuzzy value greater than 0.0 by using property 3  I 1 0.33/T1,0.33/T4,0.5/T5,0.5/T7,0.25/T8,0.33/T9 sup_count = 6 I 2 0.33/T1,0.5/T2,0.5/T3,0.33/T4,0.5/T6,0.25/T8,0.33/T9 sup_count = 7 I 3 0.5/T3,0.5/T5,0.5/T6,0.5/T7,0.25/T8,0.33/T9 sup_count = 6 I 4 0.5/T2,0.33/T4  sup_count = 2 I 5 0.33/T1,0.25/T8  sup_count = 6  Move all those transactions to L 1 whose sum value is not less than min_support \(min sup 2\herefore L 1 I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 I 5   Step 2  By using property 2, each value of RC column stores the corresponding number of similar rows.  If the transaction doesn\222t repeat then repetition column for the transaction is set to 1 as shown in Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Transaction Reduction using RC                  Step 3 Now for the generation of two item sets, consider the Matrix again.  Calculate the support count for 2 item sets by using property 4 Sup_count\(I 1 I 2 Sup_count\(I 1 I 3 4 Sup_count\(I 1 I 4 1 Sup_count\(I 1 I 5 Sup_count\(I 2 I 3 up_count\(I 2 I 4 2 Sup_count\(I 2 I 5 2  Sup_count\(I, I 35   Then move only those item sets L2  whose support count value is    not less than minimum support. Therefore, {I 1 I 2 I 1 I 3    I 1 I 5   I 2 I 3   I 2 I 4   I 2 I 5   I 3 I 5 will  be frequent 2 itemsets  Step 4 Next, consider all the 3-itemsets combinations of the items the various combinations possible are {I 1 I 2 I 5 I 1 I 2 I 4 I 1  I 2 I 3 I 2 I 3 I 5 I 1 I 3 I 5 Now, by the property 4 Sup_count\(\(I 1 I 2 I 5 2  Sup_count\(\(I 1 I 2 I 3  Therefore, {I 1 I 2 I 5 I 1 I 2 I 3 will be the collection of 3 itemsets  Step 5 Similarly, 4-itemsets possible combinations are considered i.e. {I 1 I 2 I 3 I 5 Therefore L 4 NULL. Hence all the frequent itemsets are generated  In this approach, we use property 4 for new support count.  In property 4, we combined the fuzzy intersection and value of RC column. In fuzzy intersection, if any one item has a value 0, then the intersection is not continued for the remaining items in a transaction.  RC contains the count of the similar transactions; it can greatly reduce the number of transactions to be scanned.  So, when we combine the above said three  I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 RC I1,I2,I5 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.00 0.33  I2,I4 0.00 0.5 0.00 0.5 0.00  I2,I3 0.00 0.5 0.5 0.00 0.00  I1,I2,I4 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.33 0.00  I1,I3 0.5 0.00 0.5 0.00 0.00  I2,I3 0.00 0.5 0.5 0.00 0.00  I1,I3 0.5 0.00 0.5 0.00 0.00  I1,I2,I3,I5 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.00 0.25  I1,I2,I3 0.33 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.00  SUM 6 7 6 2 2  I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 RC 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.00 0.33 1 0.00 0.5 0.00 0.5 0.00 1 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.33 0.00 1 0.5 0.00 0.5 0.00 0.00 2 0.00 0.5 0.5 0.00 0.00 2 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.00 0.25 1 0.33 0.33 0.33 0.00 0.00 1

patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
