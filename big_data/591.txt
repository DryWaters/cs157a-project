8 REFERENCES 6 9 BIOGRAPHIES 7 1 INTRODUCTION We have developed a sequence of visualization and analytical 
techniques for understanding streams of time-oriented events that have spatial attributes These techniques are implemented in a thin client software environment called GeoBoostTM 1 This type of data is quite common and includes for example streams of news articles where the events in the articles are geo-located the sequence of observed positions of a delivery vehicle as recorded by an onboard GPS and even the times and locations of Avian Flu Pandemic as reported by the government 2 2 Data of this type are commonly published using GeoRSS 
3 GeoRSS is a rather simple extension of RSS an XML specification for publishing information that includes geographical encodings to describe the location of the feed event There are two types of GeoRSS The most basic type includes a point tag georss:point>45.256 71.92</georss:point that positions the event at the specific longitude and latitude The 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper  1117 Version 5 Updated October 21 2007 more complex type includes support for richer geospatial features using GML 4 georss:where gml:Point gml:pos>45.256 71.92</gml:pos 
gml:Point georss:where GML allows the geographical attributes to be described using squares circles and other complex polygons Using GML it is possible to specify rich spatial attributes that are associated with the event The goal of our visualizations is to enable analysts to quickly grasp patterns latent in the temporal geospatial information The patterns might involve geospatial relationships among the events temporal relationships and cyclic patterns based in time and other geotemporal relationships There are four novel aspects to our work First 
our work focuses on geo-temporal relationships We have combined traditional visualization techniques e.g timelines time wheels and maps in a novel way for understanding temporal information Second we have improved upon traditional visualizations by adding interactivity Each of our visual components is live dynamic and interactive Our visual components are building blocks that enable web authors to publish time-oriented geospatial content Third we have built our software using Web 2.0 5 techniques Our visualizations are browser-based and provide rich interactivity completely within the browser The 
advantage of thin-client browser-based software is that it is easily accessed and may be broadly deployed without need for complex administrative procedures Fourth our system is designed to ingest live Geo data streams RSS has become the standard way that streaming information is published on the web By embracing this format we fit naturally into existing web infrastructures Furthermore since our visualizations are live they automatically ingest new information as it is published by the information providers New events are placed automatically on our maps and in our 
other visual components within a second or two after they are published We have added special features such as event fade out to support real-time monitoring tasks and situational awareness There is a huge advantage in embracing web protocols and building web infrastructure directly into our technology By incorporating web technology we have included many of the most significant ideas from the web including open standards real-time collaboration and flexible but simple data models The result is that we have built a powerful web-based capability for visualizing 


temporal geospatial information 2 Related Work The recent emergence of game-changing technologies such as the common availability of inexpensive GPS's and the popularity of Google Maps and Google Virtual Earth geospatial visualization is an active research area In the limited amount of space for this paper it is only possible to mention a few of the projects that have influenced us Penn State's GeoVista is a very sophisticated Java application and development environment for building geospatial applications 6 7 8 and 9 GeoVista provides a rich linked-view environment 10 and 1 1 for understanding geospatial heath care information Tufte 12 and 13 suggests a technique called small multiples for understanding where successive frames from an animation are tiled around the screen to display the information Another project GeoTime 14 demonstrates a 3D technique that combines geospatial with temporal information by mapping time to the zaxis in the view In contrast to most previous projects our focus is on web-based geospatial visualization where the visualizations run natively within the browser and exploit browser technology Two projects in particular have a similar focus and have influenced us The first is MIT's SIMLE Timeline 15 The SIMILE Timeline is a web-based multi-scale interactive timeline for understanding events in time The second project is Google Maps 16 and a closely related effort at Microsoft that was originally called Microsoft Virtual Earth 17 and has subsequently been renamed Microsoft Live Maps What Google showed is that is possible to do live interactive maps completely in a browser without need for complex desktop software These two projects are particularly interesting because that demonstrate that it is possible to build interesting software that is completely browser based and that show the utility of embracing open web protocols to enable users to create mashups A mashup is a website that combines content from several sources into an integrated experience 3 GeoBoost GeoTimelineTM Visualizing Events in Time and Space GeoBoost's GeoTimelineT is a web application used to visualize and interact with time stamped data in a browser without the need to install any additional software To be more specific our GeoBoost GeoTimelineTM is a thin client AJAX enabled visualization of temporal data that is interactive and linked to other visualizations such as maps and business charts A number of important features make the GeoBoost GeoTimelineTM unique including a b c d e f g h i j running in a thin client with no software install interactive panning and interactive zooming different time scales synchronization to other Timelines detail and summary views built in RSS support linking to other visualizations several data display modes ability to select specific data items ability to highlight specific data items rich API to program against k built in Toolbar 1 visual scalability overplotting 18 m best fit algorithms n y axis plotting line chart capability The GeoBoost framework described below provides the means of ingesting real-time and historical data that is often published as a GeoRSS feed Once data is ingested into the thin client it is stored as a collection of items which is the basic data structure displayed by the different visualizations in the GeoBoost framework The Timeline visualization itself can be thought of as a series of rectangle tiles that each represent one unit of time and are placed horizontally to fill up a specified number of pixels on the web page The unit of time represented depends on the scale of the timeline which can be set to Year Month Day Hour Minute or Second Figure 1 Two GeoBoost GeoTimelines linked to show multiple timescales Figure 1 illustrates two simple GeoTimelines placed on a web page The Overview GeoTimeline is set to Month scale and the Detailed GeoTimeline is set to Day scale Each tile is labeled with its starting date and end date Small vertical dashes are intelligently placed on the tile to indicate familiar time intervals and subintervals For instance the day tiles show each hour of the day as the smaller subinterval marks and the larger tick marks are used to divide the day into quarters The tiles are automatically generated and labeled using configurable settings for background color and date format GeoTimelines are interactive As the user drags a GeoTimeline to the left or right using the mouse new tiles are created and destroyed to give them the impression they are panning through time This new Web 2.0 interaction capability for web pages where no page refresh is required was made popular by Google Maps and other rich internet applications is very intuitive and easy to understand for users familiar with browser-based applications In addition simple buttons on the toolbar allow the user to zoom the timeline in or out and to change the current timeline scale The advantage of using two or more GeoTimelines as shown in Figure 1 is the fact they can be synchronized together When the user pans one of the GeoTimelines the other GeoTimelines scroll accordingly The blue lens in the center of the top GeoTimeline represents the entire time period displayed in the bottom GeoTimeline This capability is desirable when attempting to display a summary level and detailed view of the same data The simplest approach for displaying time stamped data on a GeoTimeline would be to plot objects corresponding to the data 2 


items on the timeline canvas This approach could support basic interactive operations like tooltips selecting and highlighting individual items or toggling an item's visibility However implementing more advanced features such as hiding a group of items become computationally expensive A second disadvantage of this approach is that it does not gracefully extend to display data from multiple data feeds described by many RSS feeds To overcome these problems our implementation renders each timeline event feed as a separate transparent overlay on top of the raw timeline canvas Each overlay may be independently populated using different event feeds and the Z-order of the overlays may be adjusted One advantage of this approach is that it is trivial to configure properties of an overlay such as toggling its visibility or changing its event feed Figure 2 Simple Events on GeoTimeline Figure 2 shows GeoTimeline's capability to ingest two separate data feeds corresponding to events generated from two Objects and display both feeds together on the same GeoTimeline Red circles are in one overlay and indicate time stamped events for Object 1 and blue circles are in another overlay and indicate time stamped events for Object 2 With a single function call all of the events for Object 1 could easily be hidden by setting the overlay's visibility to hidden This is computationally much less expensive than iterating through each individual event for Object 1 and setting that individual event's visibility to hidden GeoTimeline's toolbar contains several useful buttons that allow the user to manipulate how the individual data items are displayed Text labels can be shown for the individual items and the item can be drawn as a circle tick mark sphere or as a custom image on a per item basis Figure 3 shows the same data items from Figure 2 but with different display options set on the toolbar Also if the event for the data item has a duration that time period can be displayed as a solid rectangle Figure 3 Eliding events corresponding to Object 1 simplifies the display One problem with timeline labels is overplotting for large numbers of events To overcome this problem GeoTimeline uses a best fit algorithm to place the data item as well as the text label and date range in the appropriate place on the canvas If there is not enough space to place the item the algorithm will move down the y axis until the item would be plotted off the visualization In that case an overplotting indicator small dash at the bottom of the Timeline indicates there is a data item at a certain point in time that cannot fit on the current display The overplotting indicator acts as a visual cue to the user that they there is additional data at that moment in time and they could potentially view it by zooming in the timeline An advanced use of GeoTimeline not shown is to use some property of the data items as a value that allows it to be plotted on the y axis Essentially this turns the Timeline into an interactive line chart with time along the x axis Lines can optionally be turned on to show trends for each series of data items through time GeoTimeline supports highlighting tooltips as well as select and sweep select for data items This feature will be discussed below as it illustrates how analysis can be done when GeoTimeline overlays are linked to other visualizations like our GeoBoost Map and GeoTimeWheel 4 GeoBoost GeoTimeWheelTM Analyzing Cyclic Events The GeoBoost GeoTimeWheelTM is a temporal visualization that plots temporal data on a radial chart similar to an analog clock face Each hour of the day is represented as a different slice on the GeoTimeWheel and concentric rings represent each day of the week It is an effective visualization to view cyclic events and answer questions like What time of day do the most events occur or What day of the week appears to have the most acitivity Temporal patterns become apparent that would be hard to spot when visualizing data using GeoTimeline over a long period of time Like GeoTimeline the GeoTimeWheel is the basic visualization that exists under the overlays of data Each slice representing an hour of the day can have a custom style to draw attention to that time period or simply break up different portions of the day Data feeds are stored as collections of items which are then used to populate GeoTimeWheel overlays in the same manner as Timeline overlays Figure 4 illustrates a simple use case for the GeoTimeWheel A single overlay made up of events from Object 1 has been attached to the GeoTimeWheel By glancing at the 3 


GeoTimeWheel visualization it is apparent that most data occurred between 5:00 and 7:00 from Monday to Friday by simply noticing the clustering of points Figure 4 GeoBoost GeoTimeWheel shows cyclic patterns in temporal data The toolbar for the GeoTimeWheel is similar to the one that appears on GeoTimeline It can be used to switch between display modes or to enable labels and date ranges for the data items Data items can be shown as circles tick marks or colored tick marks There is no concept of panning or zooming the GeoTimeWheel although functionality like highlighting selection and sweep selection are all supported so that the data displayed in the GeoTimeWheel can be linked to other visualizations One option unique to the GeoTimeWheel is its ability to calculate the size of each slice based on the number of events that occurred during that time of day Instead of each slice being equal in size each becomes proportional to the number of events that occurred during that hour allowing the user to see a quick volume analysis by hour of the collection of data items 5 Combining GeoTimeLine and GeoTime Wheels with GeoBoost Maps Visual Analysis with Linked Charts The GeoBoost framework is a set of linked visual components Its power comes from its ability to display linked visualizations of real time and historical data Viewing the data by itself on a GeoBoost Map or on a GeoTimeline might be helpful but is limited in that it might not be possible to easily spot certain patterns or outliers in the data Visualizing the data in multiple charts on the same page improves the ability to see different aspects of the data but the real functionality comes from the GeoBoost's framework to highlight and select data items in one visualization and see the selections propagate instantly to all other linked visualizations Figure 5 Linked GeoBoost visual components Figure 5 shows an example of three linked GeoBoost components On the top there is a GeoTimeline Below the timeline is a GeoBoost map On the right there is a very simple GeoBoost graph component showing relationships An object on the Graph on the right is being moused-over by the user causing a tooltip to be shown describing the object More importantly however this operation causes the blue data items on the GeoBoost Map and GeoTimeline to instantly highlight outlining themselves in yellow and thereby help the user visualize the where and when about the object's events Each GeoBoost visualization component offers a user a different way to visualize the data items Linking unifies across the visualizations and allows the analysts to construct a mental model of the events in both time and space Often a user wishes to select all data items that occurred at a specific point or range in time For example Figure 6 shows a user sweep selecting all events that occurred over the period of days in the Timeline Instantly those events display as selected in the GeoTimeWheel and GeoBoost Map components to also tell the user where those events occurred and what time of day those events occurred Figure 6 Sweep selecting a time range GeoTimeLine and GeoTimeWheel help users correlate when and 4 


where for events They enable users to find clumped or regularly occurring temporal events which would be impossible to find when viewed as a linear stream of data Figure 7 shows a ISnhronizedmaines andpm regularly occurring event in the center of the top GeoTimeline and P p"rm haV mdx also a large clumping of temporal events towards the right of the  rC i top Timeline Sweep selecting either of those groups of events shows where the events occurred or when they happened Figure 7 Clumping analysis of street crimes in Washington DC Figure 8 Temporal spatial and cycle analysis of news events for the Washington DC area Figure 8 illustrates how the clumping of events can be analyzed spatially on a map temporally on a GeoTimeline and cyclically on a GeoTimeWheel The GeoTimeWheel shows that most of the new events occurred during the first 3 to 4 hours of the day As new events occur they can be compared to previous events to see if they match the previously seen patterns Figure 9 Real-time monitoring of events for situational awareness Old events fade out through time and eventually disappear Figure 9 shows GeoBoost Map and GeoTimeline used in a realtime monitoring mode The GeoBoost platform continually monitors GeoRSS providers As new events occur they are automatically added to the map and timeline using AJAX programming techniques One of the problems with real time monitoring is that eventually the display accumulates too many events which cause visual confusion To overcome this problem the GeoBoost visualization component automatically fade out the old events over time as they age Aging off items gives the user a quick visual cue as to which events are the oldest and newest based on the data items opacity 6 System Implementation The GeoBoost framework GeoTimeline and GeoTimeWheel are implemented as a set of JavaScript classes and thin client components Using these components an application developer can create advanced thin client visualizations the run natively within web browser The overall architecture consists of data components visualization components and framework/utility components From a data ingestion perspective there are several classes that allow the framework to pull in RSS and GeoRSS data feeds As pointed out in the introduction RSS is a simple protocol for publishing information The basic content of an RSS stream is a set of metadata tags organized into items that describe content The required tags in each item are title link description pubDate guid The link tag is generally a hyperlink to retrieve the item content Extending RSS with namespace extensions allows data to be added to a standard RSS feed without breaking existing parsers that understand RSS GeoRSS extends RSS by adding location information One problem that we had is that we wanted specific shapes for some of our applications that were not part of the GeoRSS specification These included ellipses sectors and slices of a circle Although these shapes could be represented in GeoRSS using a GML polygon it would be rather cumbersome To overcome this problem we developed a thinc name space extension to GeoRSS that specifically included our shapes For example the specification georss:where 5 


thincml:sector center="38.82 77.12 radius="4000 insideradius="3000 arcangle="45 georss:where startangle="90 framework and into our components The value of this is that attaching our components to a live data stream is the same operation as analyzing a fixed data source Live and static data are handled by a unified model represents a sector of a circle or a pie wedge if the inside radius is zero By default GeoBoost uses a XmlHttpRequest wrapper classes to asynchronously retrieve XML data from the server This is how RSS and GeoRSS events are pulled asynchronously from the server by the web clients The advantage of this approach is that XML data is quite standard and well understood The disadvantage is that parsing XML data on a JavaScript client is somewhat cumbersome and slow Recently however it has become popular in mashup applications to use the HTML script tags as a transport mechanism for pulling events from a server to a JavaScript client We recently implemented support for for JSON JavaScript Object Notation items so that once the data arrives on the client the data items are parsed directly into an item collection The basic idea in the GeoBoost framework is that data is represented using an ItemCollection class which is modeled after GeoRSS By default each data item has all of the attributes from the GeoRSS feed GeoBoost visual components display data taken from ItemCollections If two components are displaying the same ItemCollection they are automatically linked via tooltips selection and highlighting Item collections may be created and updated programmatically via JSON or by monitoring RSS providers Once a data item collection is loaded it can be passed to one of the many visualization classes to be rendered In addition to the temporal visualizations described previously GeoBoost includes Map Graph and standard business charts e.g Bars Pies Lines visualization components Various utility and framework components exist to make working with the visualizations easier An abstract rendering library to abstract vector drawing functions inside the visualizations so that GeoBoost platform will not be tied to a specific rendering API For instance SVG is currently the most standardized vector drawing language available in modern web browsers but other technologies like VML and WPF/E exist that could be used in place of SVG By supporting different underlying renderers in our framework our visualizations can run in a variety of web browsers depending on which vector languages they support 7 Summary and Conclusions We have developed thin client Web 2.0 AJAX visualization components for displaying temporal data Our components display the data spatially on a map temporally on a timeline and cyclically on a time wheel The components are linked so that interactive operations e.g selection tooltips highlighting automatically propagate to other components on the page The components are particularly rich and include many features for understanding timeoriented event data Some of the more interesting features include fade outs best fit algorithms for labeling and techniques to increase visual scalability Our data model extends RSS and GeoRSS Our idea is that information is now published as RSS and thus this idea and simple data structure is embedded throughout GeoBoost By cleverly using AJAX technology we have incorporated ideas from realtime monitoring and situational awareness right into our There is nothing new about linked view visualization components What is new about our approach is that linking between the components is done completely in a thin client using JavaScript built around ideas from RSS What is rather remarkable is how well it works The interactive performance of our components are all real-time and often faster than equivalent desktop software I have been told more than once that it is not possible to write thin client software that performs so well A downside of thin client applications is performance Our JavaScript library overcomes this limitation for many visualization tasks The upside of thin clients is that they inherit all of the benefits of the web including built-in collaboration light weight protocols hyper-linking etc 8 References 1 Thin Client Visualization Eick S G et al 2007 Draft Manuscript Under Preparation 2 AvinFlu.gov Pandemic Flu website
