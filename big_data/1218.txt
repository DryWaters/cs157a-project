Our analysis is performed on a sample of the 8 million\ndigitized books available in the Google Books Ngram corpus by\napplying three independent emotion detection tools: WordNet\nAffect, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and a recently\nproposed ‘Hedonometer’ method. We also assess the statistical\nrobustness of the extracted patterns as well as their outputs on\nspeci?c parts of speech. The analysis con?rms three main results:\nthe existence of recognizable periods of positive and negative\n‘literary affect’ from 1900 to 2000, a general decrease in the\nusage of emotion-related words in printed books that lasts at least\nuntil the 1980s, and, ?nally, a divergence between American and\nBritish books, with the former using more emotion-related words\nfrom the 1960s.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe study of cultural dynamics has recently been trans-\nformed by the availability, and by the relative ease of storage\nand analysis, of massive amounts of data. Novel forms of\nhuman-generated input e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs social and cultural behavior. At the same time,\nan increasing amount of ‘traditional’ data, such as books\nand newspaper articles, is digitized and made available for\nquantitative analysis.\nOne criticism targeting the use of ‘Big Data’ in social and\nhuman sciences is that the vast majority of works focuses on\na short-time scale However, ‘Long Data’ [1] with a temporal\nspan of years or even centuries \(as opposed to days or months\nfor Social Media studies example,\na new ?eld of research dubbed ‘Culturomics’ [2] proposes to\nuse quantitative data, in particular word frequencies in millions\nof digitized books, to help understand aspects of cultural\ndynamics at longer time scales.\nBuilding on those ideas, recent studies tried to analyse the\nuse of emotion-related words on long-time scale. An analysis\nof song lyrics, for example, showed a downward trend in their\n‘happiness’ from the 1960s to the mid 1990s [3]. DeWall et al.\n[4], similarly, studied word usage in song lyrics from 1980 to\n2007, and found that the use of ‘angry’ and ‘antisocial’ lyrics\nincreased over this period. In a follow-up study, Twenge et al.\n[5] concluded that individualistic words increased in American\nbooks between 1960 and 2008, whereas communal words did\n1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\n?1.0\n?0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nYear\nH\nap\npi\nne\nss\n z\n?s\nco\nres\n circles\nshow actual times series the lines show the smoothed time\nseries periods, and values below the zero indicate\ngenerally ‘sad’ periods.\nnot. In another example, it was shown that fairy tales have a\nmuch wider range of emotion word densities than novels, and\nthus, are generally more emotional’ [6].\nIn our recent work [7], we used the Google Books Ngram\ncorpus [2] to extract emotional trends from 20th century books\nwritten in English language. Our analysis yielded three main\nresults: a of recognizable periods of positive\nand negative affect \(see an example in Figure 1 the use of emotion-related words throughout the\ncentury, and c British\nbooks, with the former being comparatively more emotional\nfrom the 1960s onwards.\nIn this paper, we report on a series of analyses performed in\norder to check the level of robustness in the emotional scoring\n,\(\(\(,QWHUQDWLRQDO&RQIHUHQFHRQ%LJ'DWD\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE \nof books Primarily, we have updated our ?ndings to include\nthe new version of the Google Books Ngram corpus available\nfrom July 2012, which contains data from more than 8 million\ndigitized books1 [8].\nAn obvious concern regards the suitability of the tools\napplied for the emotion extraction from text. In [7], we applied\nWordNet Affect \(WNA selecting and labeling\nsynsets representing affective concepts [9]–[11]. Previously,\nWNA has been successfully applied for the task of extracting\ncollective mood patterns from human-generated content posted\non Social Media, such as the microblogging platform of\nTwitter [12]–[14]. Here, we compare WNA results with the\noutputs obtained from two alternative mood extraction tools,\nnamely the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count \(LIWC 15],\n[16 Twitter, dubbed\n‘Hedonometer’ \(HED  such as models for predicting\nan election outcome [18] or for estimating circadian patterns\nof affect [19 based on Social Media content.\nFurthermore, we assess the statistical robustness of the\nextracted emotion patterns by estimating con?dence intervals\n\(CIs distri-\nbution of word frequencies in language follows ‘Zipf’s law’,\nwhere the frequency of a word is 


inversely proportional to\nits frequency rank [20]–[22]. For our results, this means that\nhigh-frequency terms might determine on their own the trends\nfor speci?c emotions, obscuring the role of the numerous low-\nfrequency terms.\nLastly, an aspect overlooked in our previous analysis was\nthe role of Part-Of-Speech POS particularly good indicators of emotional content\n[23]. The new version of the Google Books Ngram corpus\nprovides POS tags, that were absent from the previous version\n[8], hence, we now can compare our original results with trends\nobtained by considering only terms tagged as adjectives or\nadverbs.\nII. DATA\nWe use data provided in the second version of the\nGoogle Books Ngram corpus.2 The corpus is a digitization\nof 8 116, 746 volumes, which represent approximatively a\n6% of all books ever published [8]. Books from a variety\nof languages are included, but, for our analysis, we make\nuse of English language books divided in three sub-corpora\nand we limit our queries to volumes published between 1900\nand 2000 \(both included three sub-corpora considered\nare: English \(all books, for a total, in the period considered,\nof 2, 980, 271 volumes English language\nbooks published in United States; 2, 073, 315 volumes and,\n?nally, British English \(English language books published in\nGreat Britain; 796, 363 volumes version used in our initial analysis [7] contained approx. 5 million\nbooks.\n2Google Books Ngram data sets http://storage.googleapis.com/books/\nngrams/books/datasetsv2.html.\nThe corpora give information on how many times, in a\ngiven year, an 1-gram or an n-gram is used, where an 1-\ngram is a string of characters uninterrupted by space \(i.e., a\nword, but also numbers, typos, and so on 1-grams. For our analysis we use only the\nfrequencies of 1-grams since the emotion extraction lexicons\nare also based around single terms. Additionally, the corpora\nprovide syntactic annotations, by tagging words with their POS\n[8].\nIII. METHODS\nIn this section, we describe the three emotion detection\ntools utilised \(WNA LIWC, HED compute CIs and to account for the various POS.\nWe focus on the three results mentioned in the Introduction.\nFor the ?rst one \(i.e., existence of recognizable periods of\npositive and negative affect compare the outputs of the\nthree emotion detection tools. For the second \(decrease of\nemotion-related words and third results \(American and British\nEnglish comparison provide an assessment of the general emotional\ncontent in the texts. The additional analyses \(CIs and POS\nanalysis third ones.\nA. Emotion Detection Tools\nIn our previous work [7] we have used, to extract emotions\nfrom the textual content of the books, WNA, a taxonomy\nof affective terms [10]. For our analysis we have considered\na Porter-stemmed [24] version of WNA, which includes six\nmood categories, each represented by a different number of\nterms: Anger \(N = 146 N = 30 N = 92 N = 224 N = 115 N 41 LIWC taxonomy of\naffective terms that has been evaluated by human judges [15].\nLIWC already includes stems of words together with complete\n\(non-stemmed General Affect \(N = 917 N = 184 N = 91 N = 499 N 408 N = 101 method \(HED  is based on a set of 3, 686 weighted words which\nwere previously evaluated for their degree of happiness us-\ning Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Differently from WNA and\nLIWC, HED does not consider explicitly terms with emotional\ncontent, but words chosen by frequency of usage and then\nevaluated for their degree of ‘happiness so that one can ?nd\nterms such as “food” or “Christmas” \(happy sad difference is that, in HED, terms\nare weighted, so that, if two terms have the same frequency in\na text, they will anyway contribute differently to the general\n‘Happiness’ score of that text [17].\n2\nB. Vector Space Model\nSimilar to [25], we represent the word frequency data by\nvectors, which, in our case, correspond to emotion words in a\ngiven data set for a particular year.\nWe compute 1-gram frequencies from 1900 to 2000 \(a total\nof 101 years b published in the USA published in the UK of books present in the corpus\nvaries considerably through the years \(books for 2000 are\nabout 10 times more than for the beginning of the century occurrences, for each year, of the word “the”, which is\nconsidered as a reliable indicator of the total number of words\nin the data set \([7], [26 well as the counts {ci, ..., cn} of the n terms \(case-\ninsensitive

In order to compare\ndifferent types of moods effectively, after computing the mood\nscores for the entire set of years \(1900 to 2000 their z-score equivalent \(MzY 2 deviation\nof the mood scores across the considered set of years.\nIn the case of HED, we extract from the Google Books\ncorpus the frequencies of 3, 686 words taken from a list\nof 10, 222 words provided in [17]. These terms represent\nthe words that were evaluated as particularly ‘happy’ or\nparticularly ‘unhappy’, and exclude neutral’, high-frequency\nwords \(stop-words case-insensitive total yearly sum \(in this case, in order to\nobtain results comparable with [17], we do not use the count\nof the  normalization in determining\nthe ‘absolute’ trends of moods \(for result b – decrease in\nthe use of emotion-related words  series\nwith a z-score derived by a random sample of 10, 000 terms\nextracted from the Part of Speech database.3 For the WNA\nexperiments this random sample of terms is stemmed, whereas\nfor LIWC we use a mix of stemmed and non-stemmed random\nterms, to replicate the composition of the lists.\n3Part of Speech database http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/pos-readme.\n1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\n?3\n?2\n?1\n0\n1\n2\nYear\nH\nap\npi\nne\nss\n z\n?s\nco\nres\n circles show actual times series, the line shows the\nsmoothed time series generally\n‘happy’ periods, and values below the zero indicate generally\n‘sad’ periods. The right y-axis reports the absolute values of\nthe ‘Hedonometer’.\nC. Con?dence Interval Estimation and Part-Of-Speech Analy-\nsis\nTo assess the robustness of our results, CIs are estimated\nfor the main emotion patterns we have presented. For this\npurpose, we apply bootstrap sampling [27]. The space of mood\nwords is sampled with replacement 10, 000 times, i.e., in each\nbootstrap, we are using a random subset of the emotion terms\nto compute the emotion time series \(or a difference between\ntwo time series, where applicable those\nresults in a yearly fashion to retrieve a mean time series and\nuse the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the bootstrap samples to\nderive 95% CIs. The latter, consequently, may vary per year.\nAs a further quality control to our initial results, we repeat\nour main analysis tasks, this time taking in consideration only\nterms that were tagged in the Google corpus as adjectives\n\(ADJ ADV is\nbased on the experimentally proven hypothesis that adverbs\nand adjectives are probably the best indicators of emotional\ncontent [23].\nIV. RESULTS\nIn the next paragraphs, we present all the results derived\nfrom our analysis. Our plots also contain a smoothed trend\nwhich is computed using Friedman’s ‘super smoother 28]\nthrough R’s function supsmu.4 Comparisons between different\ntime series are always indicated using Pearson’s correlations\nwith a sample size of N = 101 \(i.e., the years ?

Comparison of emotion detection tools\nWe compute, as in [7], a general ‘Happiness’ index for the\n20th century books present in the Google Books Ngram corpus.\nFor WNA, this index is obtained as the difference between\nthe z-score of Joy and the z-score of Sadness. Analogously,\nfor LIWC, the index is obtained as the difference between\nthe z-scores of terms representing Positive Emotions and\nSadness. The two indices \(see Figure 1 Pearson’s r = 0.82, p < 0.0005 similarities are present \(e.g., the\n‘happiness’ peak at the end of 1920s and the ‘sadness’ peak\ncorresponding to the Second World War Pearson’s\nr 0.18, p = 0.07 manages to\ntrack a negative period corresponding to the First World War\n\(compare Figures 1 and 2 trend we analyse is the general usage of\nemotion-related terms in the whole century.

This partly differs\nfrom the results presented in [7], where we identi?ed ‘Fear’\nand ‘Disgust’ as the highest and lowest trending emotions.\nFinally, we consider the difference between American\nEnglish and British English books \(Figure 4 obtained using WNA and LIWC are strongly correlated\n\(Pearson’s r = 0.87, p < 0.0005 since\nabout 1960, American books show an increase in the usage\nof emotion-related terms when compared to books written in\nBritish English.\nB. Evaluation of statistical robustness\nAs described in Section III-C, we apply bootstrap analysis\nto compute CIs for our main results in order to assess the\nrobustness of each pattern Figures 5 and 6 show CIs for\nthe ?rst main result, where we try to quantify the degree\nof ‘Happiness’ in books Joy minus Sadness for WNA and\nPositive Emotions minus Sadness for LIWC Figure 5, we conclude that the mean\n4\n1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\n?2\n?1\n0\n1\n2\nYear\nH\nap\npi\nne\nss\n z\n?s\nco\nres\n sampling.

Interestingly, a great part of this anomaly, in particular\nfor WNA, can be explained by a single high-frequency term,\nwhich is the word “like”.

Indeed, if we compare the original\nWNA ‘Happiness’ trend excluding the word “like” with the\nPOS version, their correlation is sensibly higher \(Pearson’s\nr = 0.93, p < 0.0005 Pearson’s r 0.66, p < 0.0005 terms \(see Figure 11; Pearson’s\nr = 0.99, p < 0.0005 with the WNA pattern depicted in\nFigure 3 divergence between books written\nin American and British English \(see Figure 12; Pearson’s\nr = 0.97, p 0.0005 with the WNA pattern depicted in\nFigure 4 robustness levels indicated by the CIs and presented in the\nprevious Section, i.e., WNA and LIWC ‘Happiness indices\nare less stable than the other emotional patterns.\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nWe overall ?nd a substantial agreement between the tools\nwe used to measure emotional word frequencies in publica-\ntions over the 20th century. There were some notable speci?c\ndifferences, however.\nFirst, while the general ‘Happiness scores of WNA and\nLIWC were correlated, their trends substantially differed from\n6\n1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\n?2\n?1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nYear\nEm\not\nio\nn \nG\nen\ner\na\nl \(z\n?s\nco\nres\n  WNA \(see Figure 3 z-scores of the six emotions versus a random sample\nof stems from 1900 to 2000. Circles show actual times series,\nthe line shows the smoothed time series.\nthe one retrieved using HED. The reason for this may rely on\nthe fact that HED is conceptually different from both WNA and\nLIWC, as it contains high-frequency terms evaluated for their\ndegree of ‘Happiness’, and not terms associated to particular\nemotions.\nSecondly, we found a quite different trend in aggregated\nfrequencies of all emotional words, from about 1980 to 2000,\nbetween WNA and LIWC. This may be related to differences\nbetween the contents of each emotional taxonomy; in fact the\nsets containing the top-10 terms with a relative frequency in-\ncrease during this period for LIWC and WNA were completely\ndisjoint.\nFinally, a clear divergence was evident when we considered\nonly adjectives and adverbs, rather than all emotion words.\nImposing those constraints on the input data increased the\nvariance between WNA and LIWC results and also yielded\na qualitatively different pattern in the case of literary Hap-\npiness’. We found again, however, that this anomaly might\nbe largely explained by isolated speci?c words. For example,\nsimply removing one word \(“like results to fall back to\nsimilarity with each other.\nIn general, the patterns of literary ‘Happiness’ were proven\nless robust considering the statistical proof \(bootstrap CIs further investigation\nmay be essential. On the contrary, the decline of emotion-\nword usage and the divergence between American and British\nEnglish books were consistent across our analysis.\nIn a broader perspective intuitively expected results –\n1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\n?3\n?2\n?1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nYear\nAm\ner\nic\nan\n?B\nrit\nis\nh n\(z?\nsc\nore\ns  between z-scores for emotion terms in American\nEnglish and British English for years from 1900 to 2000.\nAggregate score of the six emotions with WNA.

Our insights can be\nused to guide future work to focus on application scenarios\nwith the most room for improvement.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nThere have been several studies of MapReduce perfor-\nmance in opportunistic environment, especially in volunteer\ncomputing systems [4], [5], [11], [12]. In order to deliver\nreliable MapReduce service in a highly dynamic environ-\nment, MOON [4], [5] proposes to augment the opportunistic\nMapReduce cluster with a small number of dedicated nodes,\nwhere an adaptive algorithm is proposed for data placement\nand speculative task scheduling under such augmentation.\nAnother thread of research tries to improve performance on\nopportunistic resources by predicting the availability of these\nresources. ADAPT [12] uses the availability history to assign\nan expected availability rate to each new participant of the\nvolunteer computing system. Similar techniques are adopted\nin [11] to select a subset of most available nodes in volunteer\ncomputing systems. All of these works focus on improving\nthe performance of a single job; in contrast, our work focuses\non the fairness among multiple jobs in a shared environment.\nAnother related topic is the scheduling of MapReduce jobs\nin a dedicated environment. In addition to the FIFO, the\nCapacity, and the Fair schedulers in Hadoop release, more\nsophisticated schedulers have been proposed to satisfy various\nperformance requirements, such as LATE [8], Delay [13], DP\n[14], and Corona [15 LATE [8] proposes a more accurate pre-\ndiction of job progress in a \(physically is used together with the analysis of overhead to im-\nprove the scheduling of speculative tasks. A refined version of\nLATE in [13] incorporates delay scheduling and copy-compute\nsplitting to improve data locality and avoid performance issues\nintroduced by LATE. Dynamic Proportional Share Scheduler\n[14] takes into consideration the economic aspect of resource\nallocation by letting users bid for their resources. To 


handle\nthe drastic growth of data in Facebook, Corona [15] introduces\na cluster manager on top of JobTrackers to improve the\nscalability of MapReduce clusters by separating the duties of\nresource management and execution management.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
