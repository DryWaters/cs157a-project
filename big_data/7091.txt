R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
