identify dietary meat and preparation type factors as well as meat-derived mutage ns that are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer \(PC\. Data collected on 99 case-control pairs matched by age, gender and region, enrolled in the international Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry \(PCCR\, were analyzed. Conditional logistic regression produced adjusted \(AOR\ and unadjusted \(UOR\ odds ratios and  95% confidence intervals for tertiles determined from the control subjects as well as P values for trend  P trend using the medians for the tertiles. PC was associated with dietary in take of processed meat P trend  0.0495

Introduction  Genetic  Pancreatic cancer is relatively rare causing only an estimated 2% of all cancer cases in the world in year 2000, with 90-95% of these cases being sporadic 1  e v e r, it is t h e f o u r th leading ca u s e of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the USA 
with 5-year survival rate that is less than 5 2-3   Some 37,170 new pancreatic cancer cases and 33,370 pancreatic cancer related deaths were estimated to occur in the United States in 2007 3  About 80% of patients have metastatic disease by the time of the first clinical visit. Only 10% of the patients have been found to be operable at time of diagnosis, and even in these patients the postoperative five-year survival rate has remained below 20 4  5  Many patien t s die  within the first three months after surgery because of the extremely high rate of recurrence Few factors associated with the age of onset of pancreatic cancer have been well established so far 
because it is a rare disease and the data sets available for analysis are often too small \(particularly, in terms of the number of  pancreatic cancer cases\ere are some suggested factors that may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer development. These factors include age, race, gender, genetics, and lifestyle habits \(such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol drinking, and diet Similar to all other forms of cancers, about 75% of pancreatic cancer occurs in people at age 65 or older Thus, age is the strongest, yet nonmodifiable, risk factor known for this malignancy 6  h e s econ d  most important and best established \(and modifiable 
factor for pancreatic cancer after age, is cigarette smoking 7, 8  m o k ers  h a v e a s i g n i f i ca n t l y i n creas ed  risk of pancreatic cancer, making smoking the most consistently observed environmental risk factor Nearly every study has shown approximately a twofold increased risk for sporadic pancreatic cancer in smokers compared to nonsmokers 6  9 14  h ere is a 50% increased risk of pancreatic cancer in AfricanAmericans compared with Caucasians, and a 30 excess risk in males compared to females 6  ilial  history of pancreatic cancer as well as high sugar intake and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus have also

However the existing direct epidemiological and other evidence for such contribution is insufficient and consensus on this issue does not exist among specialists. On the other hand, meat cooked at high temperatures is a source of heterocyclic amines \(HCA\ and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \(PAH 28  w h i c h ha ve b e e n  shown to be mutagenic in Ames Salmonella Tests and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE

The objective of this international multi-center hospital-based study was to identify dietary meat factors, as well as meat preparation methods and mutagenic factors found in cooked meat \(nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines  HCAs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs associated with the carcinogenesis and risk for pancreatic cancer. We calculated the meat-derived daily intake of three HCAs \(MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP\ one polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \(PAH BaP, and a mutagenic index \(revertants per gram of daily meat intake\timated by a previously validated meat preparation questionnaire and a mutagen database  http://charred.cancer.gov/hpfs.html Data from the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry \(PCCR\ were analyzed  2. Patients and Methods  2.1. Study design  The Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry PCCR\ is a web-based, multi-center, international pancreatic cancer registry that was established in 2003 to collect disease-related information in a standardized and efficient way 34  ers e x te n s i v e co m p u t er based quality control procedures and user-friendly web-based questionnaires. The overall goal of the PCCR consortium has been to create a collaborative infrastructure that would allow researchers from multiple centers around the world to collect a variety of critical information and biospecimens data on pancreatic cancer patients and high-risk subjects, as well as to mine the collected data and perform sophisticated data analysis. At present, eight cancer centers \(seven in the USA and one in Italy\ utilize this system. As of May 22, 2008, the PCCR contained data on 1,530 subjects with sporadic and familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The data collection is accomplished through a complex survey that is completed either online or via a multi-page form, and requires approximately one hour to complete. Data collected in the PCCR have been used as a platform for several research projects on familial pancreatic cancer 35-37   which should lead to a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of pancreatic cancer The matter of details on standardization and categorization of the collected data has been carefully worked out and rigorously implemented from the inception of the PCCR. For this purpose, four committees \(Pathology / Specimen, Epidemiology Instrument, Imaging Collection, and IRB\were organized from a group of twenty-one experts. A core data set for the PCCR has been agreed upon by these groups. It is generated from questionnaires that have already been utilized in the participating institutions, as well as from established forms for the sociodemographic, environmental, clinical and family history data of individuals and family members with a history of pancreatic cancer. Existing standards, such as Health Level 7 \(HL7\ternational Classification of Diseases \(ICD-9\ystematized Nomenclature of Medicine \(SNOMED\d Common Data Elements CDE\were utilized during the development of the forms A list of required data elements for clinical epidemiological, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and quality of life \(QoL\udies is presented below  Date of birth  Date of study  Age at diagnosis/age at study  Birth country  Gender  Marital status  Race/ethnicity  Current height & weight  Usual weight at age 20, 50, prior to illness  Education highest level completed  Tobacco/smoking habits  Alcohol consumption \(current & past  Confirmed index case \(Y/N  Imaging studies done  Stage \(pathologic & clinical\t diagnosis  Surgical intervention \(Y/N  Medications  Other Diseases & date of diagnoses  Previous surgery  Previous involvement in other cancer research  Radiation exposure  Summary of family history Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


Optional data elements cover a variety of questions divided into Personal Demographic, Lifestyle Physical Activity, Dietary Habits, Family History QoL, Medical History Treatment, Surgery Biospecimen, and Follow-up questionnaires  Experts suggested that: \(i\ersonal, Demographic Lifestyle, Physical Activity, Dietary Habits, Family History, Quality of Life, information may be provided by the subject; \(ii\formation on Medical, Treatment Surgery, Biospecimens, and Follow-up must be provided by clinician/institution involved in the subject s care; and \(iii\the core data set should also include the following administrative data elements Date when the case was submitted; Current status of the case; Registering institution code; Person completing the case \(Name, telephone, email\bject identification code PCCR Architecture The PCCR system has been implemented using a three-tier, Web-based architecture: \(i\t that interacts with the user; \(ii an application server that contains the business logic of the application; and \(iii\ resource manager that stores the data. The components of this system are written using Java, SQL, and JavaScript programming languages. PC-related data is stored in a relational database \(Oracle 10g PCCR Web Interface The PCCR website can be accessed at http://pccrproject.org The PCCR user interface is designed to eliminate ambiguity in the data collected and assist users with accuracy and ease of completion. Most of time, users are given the lists of standard options to choose from, instead of text fields The validation components prevent the users from entering erroneous information into the system. The quality of the PCCR user interface has been one of the major focuses during the project development PCCR Security   The security of the patient s personal information collected in the PCCR has been addressed using recommendations of the Computer-based Patient Record Institute \(CPRI\d the electronic information security standards mandated by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA According to the CPRI, a complete security solution that maximizes the benefits of networked data communications must contain the following elements User Authentication, Access Control, Encryption Physical Protection, and Management  User authentication, access control, and data encryption issues have addressed during the application s initial development, while physical protection and network management have been provided by the production environment  2.2. Study population  One thousand one hundred and ten \(1,110\poradic cases diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma \(exocrine\ were enrolled in the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry \(PCCR\ as of May 22, 2008. Of these cases and the healthy controls enrolled in the PCCR at the Italian collaborating center University of Genoa\we selected for the study 99 case-control pairs matched by age \(within 5 years gender and region who satisfied the inclusionexclusion study criteria. All cases were individuals with newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma International Classification of Diseases for Oncology code C25.3, WHO, 2000\The controls were noncancer individuals admitted to the hospital for diseases other than cancer and unrelated to digestive tract disease or to known risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The main diagnostic categories for hospital admission are acute surgical and musculoskeletal diseases Men and women diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 35-85 years since 1980 were included in the study as cases. Included were patient cases and control subjects who completed the meat questionnaire while excluding those with missing or erroneous information. The Institutional Review Boards \(IRBs of all institutions participating in the PCCR had approved this study protocol  2.3. Dietary assessment  The questionnaires implemented in the PCCR are well established in the cancer research community such as the NCI Quick Food Scan Percent Fat Screener questionnaire 38  39  o cr eate th e phy s i ca l acti v i t y  page, the American Cancer Society s \(ACS\amples of moderate versus vigorous physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention were used 40  Whenever possible, in-person interviews were conducted with the subjects to obtain information including basic demographic information, cigarette smoking history, dietary intake, physical activity, and medical and family history, among others. The NCI Quick Food Scan Percent Fat Screener questionnaire  39  a s t h e bas i s f o r t h e asses s m e n t of t h e percen t of energy from fat intake.  A self-administered meatcooking practices module \(FFQ\eloped at the NCI, was completed to assess the consumption of 14 meat/preparation items using a matrix format that asked about participants weekly consumption before beginning to feel sick. Each of 4 types of meat \(beef pork, poultry, and fish\were crossed with each of 3 types of preparation \(BBQ/grilled, fried, and baked form 12 meat/preparation combinations, whereas 2 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


more combinations \(cold cuts, smoked meats involving any type of meat were separately surveyed bringing the total of meat/preparation combinations to 14. The questionnaire collected information on how many servings \(0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6\ the 14 meat/preparation combinations were consumed per week. The intake of mutagens and carcinogens from cooked meat were assessed by the Computerized Heterocyclic Amines Resource for Research in Epidemiology of Disease \(CHARRED system, using the average values for doneness since information on doneness was not collected CHARRED has been developed at the NCI  http://charred.cancer.gov/hpfs.html nd comprises a detailed meat cooking module within a food frequency questionnaire \(from some 120 categories of meat\n conjunction with a mutagen database. Thus estimates on mutagenic activity \(which is a measure of total mutagenic potential that summarizes all meat-related mutagens\heterocyclic amines \(HCAs: MeIQx DiMeIQx, and PhIP\d a and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon \(PAH: benzo\(a\rene \(BaP\were obtained using average portion size and the frequency data from the dietary meat and preparation frequency questionnaire  2.4. Statistical analysis  The data were summarized and reported using means and standard deviations for continuous variables or, as appropriate for categori cal variables, proportions or odds ratios \(OR\with 95% confidence intervals 95% CIs\. When cases were compared with controls for the demographic and risk factor tables, the twogroup non-parametric Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and, respectively, the Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables were used. Correlations between variables were reported using the nonparametric Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. Dietary meat and preparation type variables \(measured in servings per week\ well as mutagens were modeled as continuous variables \(as the log of the number of servings\ when a model was examined for the presence of interactions, and also as categorical variables by comparing the lowest tertile to the second and third tertiles. The tertiles were determined from the distribution among the control subjects.  On those occasions when test for trend was performed, the medians for the respective tertiles of dietary pattern were used in the analysis as exposure scores 41  T h e re port ed  u n a dj u s t e d O dds R a t i o s UOR\or the effect on pancreatic cancer risk of the respective risk factor \(meat or preparation type or mutagen\when analyzed alone in a conditional logistic regression model. All adjusted Odds Ratios \(AOR\ are from the expanded conditional logistic regression model when the effect of the respective risk factor has been adjusted for the following known and suspected mostly nondietary, risk factors for pancreatic cancer age, sex, height, usual weight, smoking, education percent of energy intake from dietary fat, and a history of diabetes for >2 years prior to the date of cancer diagnosis in PC cases or data collection \(a.k.a. pseudodiagnosis\ in control subjects. All covariates were chosen based on previous research implicating them as putative risk factors for pancreatic cancer \(with only age and smoking firmly confirmed, as mentioned in the introduction section\. There were at least 10 casecontrol pairs \(i.e. outcome events variable \(EPV\hus satisfying the rule of thumb requirement for logistic regression models 42  i n c e  we have not collected data on total energy intake, we indirectly adjusted for it using height, usual weight and BMI, as suggested in 43  We f u rth e r f i tted models for AOR with and, respectively, without height, usual weight, and BMI, but here we have presented only the results from models adjusting only for energy from dietary fat \(which was statistically significant\ and not for height, usual weight, and BMI since the two models led to the same results and fewer individuals were excluded due to missing values When first-order interaction terms were tested in a model \(e.g. between meat consumption variables or total meat and demographic factors\ey were selected by a backwards selection procedure with 0.10 significance level for staying in the model. The statistical package SAS 9.1 \(SAS Inst, Inc, Cary, NC was used in all analyses, and all reported P values are two-sided. When reporting statistical significance we have always referred to level of significance 0.05  3. Results  3.1. Demographics  This study sample included 99 pancreatic cancer cases and 99 noncancer controls pair-matched by age within 5 years\, gender and region who satisfied the inclusion-exclusion study criteria and were available from the PCCR registry as of May 22, 2008. Patients  records were collected by the medical center in Italy University of Genoa\ where the matching had been performed initially. The vast majority of cases and controls were Caucasian \(over 99% in both groups with slightly higher number of males among the matched pairs, 50 \(50.5%\. The average age at diagnosis for the cases was 65.8 years, which was lower than the average age of 69.9 years at data collection \(a.k.a. pseudo-diagnosis\for the controls Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4

Indeed, assuming average serving size of 150 g, the latter quantities translate to 11.6 for Italy and, respectively, 16.0 weekly servings for the USA. Grilling was the preferred preparation method for both cases and controls, with 5.79 and 5.34 weekly servings, respectively. Also for grilling, red meat was on average the predominant choice among both cases and controls. Whereas the type of meat was concerned, the controls consumed similar number of servings of poultry and fish as the cases, \(6.33 versus 6.29\ but the cases consumed more servings of red meat than the controls \(4.95 versus 4.48\The difference in consumption of grilled red meat was statistically significant \(P = 0.0199\ was the difference \(P = 0.0386\or the consumption of grilled fish, although the directions of these two differences were opposite. Cases and controls consumed on average similar amounts of servings of baked meat poultry and fish, as well as processed meat Consumption of processed meat was also similar in cases and controls. For the purpose of the analysis, we followed the matrix format of the dietary meat questionnaire and grouped the response variables into two groups for the weekly consumption frequencies: \(i meat preparation method \(grilling, frying, baking, meat processing\ and \(ii\ meat type \(red meat, poultry, and fish\ce each of the original variables \(i.e. fried poultry, baked red meat, etc.\tributed to each of these two groups, the pairwise correlations between meat preparation method variables and meat type variables were quite high. In particular, the highest values of the Spearman correlation coefficient were between red meat and frying \(r rf 0.59\, red meat and baking \(r rb 0.53\ and grilling and poultry \(r gp  0.47\. The correlations among meat types were moderate \(Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from 0.17 to 0.23\ On average, the smallest were the correlations among meat preparation methods, ranging from 0.13 \(between frying and grilling\ to 0.23 between frying and baking\hese results indicate much stronger selectivity among the responders for the meat preparation method than for the meat type. All mentioned correlation coeffic ients were statistically significant \(P < 0.01 We also examined the differences between cases and controls with respect to mutagens intake, as determined by the CHARRED system.

Tertile analysis showed that increasing intake of MeIQx across tertiles was significantly associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer \(P trend 0.0444\with AOR = 2.33 for the highest tertile group compared with the lowest tertile group. Similarly, BaP across tertiles was marginally significantly associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer \(P trend 0.0687\ith AOR = 2.21 for the highest tertile group compared with the lowest tertile group  4. Discussion  In this hospital-based matched-pairs case-control study, pancreatic cancer was positively associated with dietary intake of processed meat \(in a non-linear fashion\ as well as increased intake of the mutagen MeIQX and, to a lesser extent, with frying and the increased dietary intake of the mutagen BaP. The associations were robust to multivariate adjustment Neither total meat nor the mutagenicity index \(which reflects the total meat consumption to a great extent in our study\ showed significant effect on the risk for pancreatic cancer In our discussion below we have focused on three recent cohort studies 20  25  26  of pan c reatic can cer that have dealt with meat consumption and/or methods of preparation, and one very recent hospital-based case-control study 33  t h at h a s in v e s t ig a t e d th e association of mutagens and pancreatic cancer Our study differed from the three cohort studies in its design \(matched-pairs case-control versus cohort its method of statistical data analysis \(logistic regression versus the Cox model\d in the number of the pancreatic cancer cases ascertained. As long as the case-control study is concerned, ours differed from it in the matching, the number of study participants and the level of detail in the questionnaires used. However some of our conclusions were similar to those arrived at by these four studies  Michaud et al 20  ha ve c o nd uc t e d a c o ho r t st ud y ascertaining 178 pancreatic cancer cases, and have found that intakes of total meat and red meat were not related to risk. This is similar to what we have found In 20  n di v i du al  f ood i t e m s  con t ri bu t i n g  t o i n t a k e s o f  total meat or fish had not revealed any specific association. However, the influence of cooking practices, intake of meat mutagens, as well as other dietary habits on the risk of pancreatic cancer was not examined in 20  d com p aris on cou l d n o t be m a de Larsson et al 26  a v e  u s e d t h e C ox proport i o n a l  hazards model in a prospective study of 172 incident pancreatic cancer cases, and found that l ong-term red meat consumption was positively associated with risk of pancreatic cancer P trend 0.01\, long-term poultry consumption was inversely associated with the risk  P trend 0.04\hereas fish consumption was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk.

increases in pancreatic cancer, whereas in our study we measured only percent energy from fat which turned out to be a very significant risk factor However 25  did not investigate the methods of meat preparation or the effect of mutagens/carcinogens, and no comparison with our study can be drawn with respect to those Li et al 33  ha ve c o nd uc t e d a  ho sp i t a l b a se d c a s e control study on the association of meat-derived mutagens and risk for pancreatic cancer involving 626 cases and 530 noncancer controls. They have found that the cases had a higher daily intake of food mutagens and mutagenicity activity \(revertants per gram of daily meat intake\an controls did, similar to what we found. In 33  e dail y i n ta k e s o f DiMeIQ x and benzo\(a\yrene \(BaP\ well as the mutagenic activity, were significant predictors for pancreatic cancer, with adjustment of other confounders. In quintile analysis, they have also observed a significant trend of elevated cancer risk with increasing DiMeIQx intake P trend 0.024\which was different from our own result when adjusted P trend 0.239. Particularly, in  33  ey  h a v e  f oun d th at a h i gh er i n tak e o f dietar y  mutagens \(those in the highest two quintiles\ad been associated with a 2-fold increased risk for sporadic pancreatic cancer, similar to our finding of AOR 2.33 for MeIQx. Interestingly, Li et al 33  fo und a  possible synergistic effect of dietary mutagen exposure and smoking that was observed among individuals with the highest level of exposure \(top 10%\hIP and BaP Our study has its weaknesses and room for future improvement. For example, because PCCR is still gathering strength and numbers, in future studies we should be able to recruit a larger number of suitable controls for case-control matching \(e.g. within centers for age and sex\, which will likely increase the statistical power. An improved \(i.e. more detailed meat and preparation methods questionnaire with portion size and donennes would also likely increase the statistical power and make possible to obtain more precise estimates of the effects of the studied risk factors. It should be noted that completion of the current questionnaires requires about an hour already and extending them would likely make it more difficult for the study participants \(particularly the pancreatic cancer cases\mplete them  4.

This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
