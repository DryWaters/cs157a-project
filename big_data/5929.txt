OSSC-2011  New Method about How to Construct Decision Tree Based on Association Rule  Jing Gao Information College of Capital University of Economics and Business Beijing, 1000 83, China gaojinggaoj@sohu.com Baoyong Zhao School of Automation Electrical Engineering University of Science and Technology Beijing Beijing, 1000 83, China Key Laboratory of Advanced C ontrol for Iron and Steel Pro cess, Ministry of Education, China zbyfirst@163.com   Abstract Nowadays, decision tree is widely used as one of the most powerful tools in data mining. However, to construct an optimization decision tree is a complete NP problem. So a new 
method about how to construct decision tree, which is based on association rule mining, is proposed in this paper. Firstly approximate exact rule with high reliability is defined. Secondly new attributes are generated from the approximate exact rule And then its evaluation method is disc ussed in detail. Thirdly, the decision tree is constructed with both the new generated attributes and its original data Finally, after comprehensive analysis, experimental results show that this new method has higher accuracy than any other old method Keywords- association rule; approximate exact rule; decision tree I   I NTRODUCTION  Decision tree is one of intuitionistic methods used in knowledge presentation. And it is also a kind of high efficiency classifier. Its main idea is: firstly, it tak es information theory as its useful tool, selects important 
attributes or combinatorial attributes sets about non-leaf nodes, partitions training sample sets from top to bottom till so me curtain terminate condition comes. This condition is that all samples of nodes are in the same category. In theory, the am ount of leaf node and its depth determines whether the decision tr ee is excellent or not. Take the rule of shortest descripti on length into account, many researchers focus on those decision trees who have least leaves and each of them has least depth It is testified that to constru ct an optimization decision tree is a complete NP problem much m ore research on decision tree mainly focuses on usi ng all kinds of heuristic functions to measure attribute’s importance, as well as using all kinds of strategies to prune d  in m o st cases, either the original attribute contained in data is redundant, or its inclusive inform ation amount is not enough Therefor this undoubtedly affected constructing decision tree 
So this paper‘s main purpose is that by taking feature extraction and construction into account, new attributes, which are most closely related to decision attributes, can be easily constructed on the basic of original attributes. It is known that excellent attribute extraction and construction depends on field knowledge. And this method also depends on field expert seriously. Considering that th is method has much more cost, it is not fit for dealing with mass data In this paper, association rule is adopted to construct new feature. By using this method, automation degree on feature construction can be well improved And high cost bring by field knowledge can be easily avoided. So it is quite suit for dealing with mass data. Since the problem that there are many redundant rules in mining association rule does exist. So in this paper, new attribute is construct ed by using the approximate 
exact rules that has high reliabi lity, instead of by using all mined rules. And in this paper, the evaluation standard of new attribute is proposed by using information compensation. Then decision tree is constructed by new attribute, as well as its original data attribute. At last, experimental result shows that this kind of decision tree method has more accuracy II  A SSOCIATION RULE MINING  Association rule mining, whose main purpose is to find the interesting association or relativit y among all item sets in mass data, plays an important role in data mining research field[4  Here   12   m I Sii i   stands for item sets.

paper which relates to task data, stands for database transaction sets T And its condition is described as T TDB I S   Every transaction has its own identifier, marked with TI  Suppose is an item set, and transaction T contains  if and only if A The format of associa tion rule is described as here condition is A D A A T  A  B I S   B

And in this paper n also stands for transaction number that both A and is contained in data sets. So the main purpo se of association rule mining is to find out those rules which have minimum support degree marked with inimum reliability \(marked with me time in data sets. And those rules are usually called strong rul es in association rule mining N A n A B  B _ min sup _ min conf Here item set is called itemset. And if there are elements in an itemset, it can be described as itemset. If the number of support degree is equal or larger than then it is called frequent itemset. And this kind of frequent item is usually marked with  k k _ min sup k k F Theorem 1 \(Apriori characteristic All the non-null subsets of frequent itemset are freque nt.  And all the supersets of frequent itemset are also frequent III  N EW METHOD ABOUT HOW TO CONSTRUCT DECISION TREE BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE  A  Generate new attributes Although the re are many methods on how to mine association rule, th ese methods have their own weaknesses: the number of rule, mined by associa tion rule, is too huge to be understood and to be applied into practice. So that which new attribute, generated by associati on rule, should be chosen seems quite important in association rule mining. Here the mining result is li mited as followings Firstly, the latter condition of mined rule must be the attribute classifi ed in data set Secondly, what is focused on in this paper is the approxim ate exact rule, which has higher reliability. After all the main purpose of mining rule is to generate new attribute which is closely related to classified attribute In a word, what sh ould be chosen as targ et rule in this paper is the rule whose latter condition classified attribute has high reliability Definition 1: According to association rule if R: A B  A\\(A B sup sup 012    N  012  then R is called approximate exact rule According to definition 1, so called approximate exact rule is the rule whose latter cond ition hardly appears on a few exceptional occasion, when its former condition appears. That is to say the rule has highe r reliability. And there is compact relationship between former con dition and latter condition In Apriori algorithm, width priority searching strategy is adopted to gene rate frequent itemset layer by layer. That is to say itemset is used to generate itemset. The main idea of this algorithm is as followings k 1 k Firstly  itemset, which is mark ed with is generated according to minimum support threshold 1 1 F Secondly  candidate set, which is marked with is generated by joining And then itemset, which is marked with is generated according to minimum support threshold, and so on 2 2 C 1 F 2 2 F Finally, algorithm will stop till no itemset can be generated k In this algorithm, in order to generate every transaction database should be entirely searched k F In this paper, the new algorithm on how to mine approximate exact rule is proposed on basic of Apriori algorithm And this new algorithm is marked with Algorithm 1, in this paper Algorithm 1:  mine approximate exact rule Input: dataset TD minimum support degree threshold  B _ min sup 012  Output: approximate exact ru le, whose classified attribute is latter condition, here th e rule is marked with A RC  Algorithm description is as followings 015  initiate 1 F 1 1 F   015  1 k   015  for every classified attribute c do C  015  while k F  do 015  for every frequent itemset k f F  do 015  if  th en   _ sup c f min sup  015  if  then  _ sup c f min sup  015   A RC f c   015  1  kk C Candidtate Gen F    015  11 kk FC    


OSSC-2011  015   k  015  endwhile 015  endf or Then the former condition of approxim ate e x act rule m ined b y Algorithm 1, will be add as new attribute into dataset. For example, if approximate exact rule mined in Algorithm 1 is described as 111 2 21 3 31 1 A aAaAa B  b 3 Then 112 A NAAA  can be chosen as a new candidate attribute. Here is the condition formula   3 111 2 21 3 3 1 1  0  if A a A a A a AN else      1 B  Evaluate new attribute Although by using the me thod mentioned in chapter 3.1 new candidate attr ibute can be generated. Maybe, there is such doubt that whether the new candi date attribute will be valuable for classification. Here further evaluation should be paid more attention to. In this paper, an approximate evaluation standard is proposed by using informati on plus for reference, as well as by using support degree parameter and reliability parameter of association rule mining for reference. Here this standard is called approximate information plus  For candidate attribute and its relative appro ximate exact rule j AN j R  jj A NB  j b  A N is former condition of j R h is as followings Firstly, candidate attribute j A N is selected as root of a decision tree, whose information amount is described as following formula   2 1 log n j j root j nn G NN             Here stands for total number of transaction in data sets stands for th e number of classifica tion attribute. And  stands for jth value of cl assification attribute N n j n When data sets is partitioned by candidate attribute, the number of data record, when is described as following formula 1 j AN  1   i i s up R NN conf R        For those data records, when the number of dat a record, where the value of 1 j AN B  classification attribute is equal to is described as following formula j b  2  i NNsupR    While for those data records, when the number of data record, where the value of 1 j AN B classification attribute is not equal to is unknown. Since the new rule is generated by using approximate exact rule, that is to say when the former condition of rule appears, its la tter condition hardly appears on a few exceptional occasion, the information amount of this kind of data here is omitted. So t he information amount of the data record, when is described as following formula j b 1 j AN  12 2 12 11 log NN N G NN N      And the information amount of the data record, when 1 j AN  is described as following formula  31    i i conf R sup R NNNN conf R    i   Suppose in data sets, the val ue of those data records, whose classification attribut e value is marked with 1,2 k bk n   and is marked with the information amount of this kind of data records is described as following formula 1 j AN  3 k N  333 22 1 33 log n kk k NNN NNN    G      In a word, the approximate information plus of new attribute is described as following formula 12  i root Gain AN G G G  2 1 log n j j j nn NN      12 2 2 11 log NN N NN N     333 2 1 33 log n k k NNN NNN       k 0 10 In data sets, if then attribute will be still kept in use, else it will be abandoned  i Gain AN  i AN C  Algorithm process On basic of description mentioned above and according to algorithm  new m e thod about how to construct decision tree based on association rule is proposed in this paper And this algorithm is marked with AR-C4.5 


OSSC-2011  Algorithm 2: AR-C4.5 Input: approximate exact rule ARC generated by algorithm 1 Output: a decision tree Algorithm description is as followings 015  generate new candidate attribut e by former condition of the rules in ap proximate exact rule set A RC   015  for every candidate attribute j A N  do 015  compute  by using formula \(10  i Gain AN  0 015  if  then  i Gain AN  015  keep  in use j AN 015  else abandon j A N   015  construct decision tree by using algorithm C4.5 according to data attribute as well as new generated attribute D  C ompare to other research work The main purpose both of data mining and machine learning is to construct accuracy and efficient classifier for large-scale database. Recently, many researchers atte mpt to design classifier by us ing association rule Association classification met hod, marked with CBA, is proposed in docume Its main idea is as followings Firstly, by using association rule mining algorithm \(such as Apriori algorithm\, all association rules are entirely mined, in condition that the latter cond ition of rule is restrained .Then these rules are ordered by reliabil ity. At last, these ordered rules are classified And a similar decision tr ee \(called ADT association rule, is designed by using association rule, in docum Its m a in idea is that every node corresponds to a rule and all association rules are ordered from ecumenic to idiographic layer by layer Compared with the idea in documents mentioned above, the characteristic of this pap er is as followings: 1 is not used for classification, but fo r generating new attribute; 2 it is intuitionistic and easy understood, after all classifier is presented by decision tree IV  E XPERIMENTAL VALIDATION  Compared with algorithm C4.5 by using data set, which co rresponds to anneal*, heart and auto* respectively in UCI resou rce  and in the circumstances that threshold of minimum support degree   _=5 min sup _=10 min sup 5 N 012   10 N 012 here stands for total number of data record in data set\m has different classification accura cy. The contrastive data is shown as Figure 1 N  classification accuracy dat a set    a\ accuracy when 012 5%N  classification accuracy dat a set    b\curacy when 10 N Figure 1  contrastive accuracy on three data sets It is obvious in Chart 1 that algorithm AR-C4.5 has higher accuracy in three data sets than algorithm C4.5 does. It is also clear that the accuracy of algorithm AR-C4.5 decreases a little when increases from 5%N to 10%N The main reason is that when increases, as well as that the former condition of approximate exact rule appears, while the probability that the latter condition of approximate exact rule doesn’t appears has increa sed. So unexpected increasing of new attribute appears. This results in decreasing accuracy V  C ONCLUSION  Decision tree is an important tool in data mining. But to construct decision tree is a complet e NP problem, for original data is redundant or its informa tion amount is not enough In this paper, new attribute is constructed by using association rule m ethod. Thinking of that association rule mining has its own problem, t oo many redundant rules, so the approximate exact rule, which has high reliability, is selected to construct new attribute, inst ead of the whole rule mined And an algorithm on mining approximate exact rule is proposed in t his paper. Then the evaluation standard of new attribute is also proposed by using information plus idea Finally, decision tree is construct ed by both new generated attribute and data itself. And experimental data shows that new method has higher accuracy than other method
