Large enterprises often invest in wireless intrusion prevention systems \(WIPS\hat use distributed sensors to keep a full-time eye on wireless traffic. The most effective way to mitigate rogue threats is 24/7 WIPS .But if your business can't afford WIPS Mobile phones, wireless laptops which are used to connect to the access point in the wireless local area network contain the WLAN card T he di sa d v a nt a ge s o f w i r e l e ss LA N  technology is that there are ways by which air traffic can be sniffed using network interface card in monitor or RFMON mode [12 Th e ca re s h ou l d be tak en ag ain s t w i reles s  at ta ck s  such as disabling its SSID broadcasting, changing the default

This open source tool can be installed on the laptops and wireless air traffic can be sniffed very easily. On Linux Kismet software is used to capture the air traffic of the wireless LAN and for Windows software like Netstumber can be used We explore the use of skew interval of a wireless local area network access point \(AP\ as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and accurately. The main goal behind using skew intervals is to overcome one of the major 
limitations of existing solutions\204the inability to effectively detect Medium Access Control \(MAC\ addresses spoofing. We calculate the skew interval of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function \(TSF\ time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. For calculating clock skews frame beacon frame we have used two approach based on linear programming and the other based on least-square fit Once we have calculated the clock skews of AP, which will acts as fingerprint of AP, and then we have use heuristic for differentiating packets from those sent by the Unapproved Aps and authorize AP. There is quantifying impact of various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization 
skew source selection, and NTP synchronization on skew intervals. The use of skew intervals appears to be an efficient and robust method for detecting rough APs in wireless local area networks II 
 
W IRELESS L AN  Wireless LAN can be defined as network of wireless devices that are interlinked with each other by wireless medium. WLAN provides a major advantage over the wired network as the end users can move in an area and remain connected with the network. It provides mobility and scalability with broad range of coverage area. This advantage has made this technology so popular among the end users that it is widely used in every field today 
All the devices in the wireless network are called stations Each station has a Wi-Fi network card \(WNICs\hey fall into two categories: access points and clients. The BSS area covered by WLAN has an identifier called Service set identifier \(SSID\he following components are used in wireless LAN for establishing a wireless connection  Basic service set \(BSS\ is referred to all the stations that can communicate with each other in wireless network.

War driving, also called access point mapping, is the act of locating and possibly exploiting connections to wireless local area networks while driving around a city or elsewhere Wireless Local area network  P ROBLEMS I N I EEE 802.11 Apparently, it is harder to maintain consistent, robust and secure communications in an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN \(WiFi\an in Ethernet because of the nature of the wireless medium. In other words, several problems exist peculiarly in use of Wi-Fi: connectivity problems, performance problems and network security In utilization of radio signals, Wi-Fi cannot provide network users with consistent access to the Internet. For example, even in a small building that can be covered by an AP, such as a network cafe, some spaces are hidden from radio signals by obstacles. Such spaces are called ``dead spots'' or RF holes'', and typically this problem is resolved by deploying more APs [8   Accordingly, since associations between APs and wireless stations are made by virtual wires in Wi-Fi, they are physically inconsistent and vulnerable to interference in surrounding devices, such as a microwave oven and cordless phones as well as other APs operating nearby. Additionally, these virtual wires easily allow radio signals to take different paths to a destination, causing multipath propagation problem [15  With  respect to network security, one of the problems to be considered is installation of unauthorized APs or rogue APs 8  Un s e cu r ed  rog u e A P s  ar e lik ely to b e s e cu ri ty h o les  f o r  enterprise networks and could provide access to unauthorized users. Recently, problems caused by rogue APs have been very common, and installations of them are typically done by ignorant enterprise employees. In practice, detecting rogue APs, though more efficient ways have been developed, still counts on a very rudimentary way, where equipped IT personnel walk around the buildings catching beacons from wireless APs and identifying their MAC addresses On the other hand, for wireless network users, accessing unsecured APs that are not protected by passwords may raise a threat, nicknamed as ``evil twins''. Works in [16  re p o r t s t h at evil twins are dummy APs that are intentionally deployed by adversaries targeting to intercept sensitive data from associating wireless stations. Thus, during associations with evil twins, all transmitting packets could be logged and the ones without encryption could be analyzed thereafter Furthermore, evil twins often send stronger signals than legitimate APs in order to grab wireless connections from the legitimate ones [16   However, even with encryption and pseudonyms, attackers with expertise can read user information and distinguish them from others by utilization of fingerprinting techniques \(i.e identify the sender of the packets\ [17   IV 725 contain identifier \(ID\ MAC address of the AP serving that BSS                   Fig. 1 The attacker is in between sender and receiver. The sender sends the message to receiver but it passes through the attacker and sender and receiver is aware of this thing. This is called as Man in the Middle attack Evil Twin AP WLAN architecture defines the components of wireless network. To establish a connection between the devices there are generally five basic steps First is Scanning, process for finding wireless network in nearby region, stations uses scanning module to find the existing networks in that area. For this procedure they have to consider certain parameters listed below BSS can be with AP or without AP.

Third, as the beacon time stamp is the actual time when an AP sends a frame \(i.e., the time after the channel is sensed to be free\ rather than the time when it is scheduled to send the frame, we do not need to consider any significant unpredictable delays incurred by the network as in the case of TCP time stamps First, beacons are sent all the time and at a fast rate typically, 10 to 100 frames per second\ independent of any application 2 Rogue Access Points Fingerprint Technique Cryptographic Method The new wireless security enhancement 802.11i RSNA Robust Security Network Association\ uses traditional cryptographic methods \(i.e., digital certificates\provide strong mutual authentication between wireless clients and the APs. Although this solution, if implemented properly, will make the fake AP attack less likely, the following practical issues can still make wireless networks using 802.11i RSNA vulnerable. First, management and verification of digital certificates across different domains are known to be cumbersome. Second, as the current AP selection algorithms use signal strength as the only criteria for AP selection, users can be fooled to connect to the fake AP that has higher signal strength compared to the original one but does not support any security measures such as RSNA. These facts motivate us to find a viable no cryptographic solution to the fake AP attack We emphasize that this solution is not meant to replace existing cryptographic methods. Rather, it should be used in conjunction with the cryptographic methods to achieve a higher level of security in WLANs. The current state-of-the art no crypto methods for unauthorized AP detection cannot detect fake APs            Fig. 2 We explore a passive online scheme that can detect fake APs with high accuracy and minimum overhead. An AP\220s clock skew acts as its fingerprint. Kohno and coauthors have shown that the clock skew of a device remains fairly consistent over time but the clock skews vary significantly across devices thereby arguing that the clock skew of a device can be used as its reliable fingerprint. However, Kohno\220s scheme focused on wide area wired networks. Unlike Kohno\220s scheme that uses TCP/ICMP time stamps, in our scheme, we use the Time Synchronization Function \(TSF\ time stamps. The AP send the beacon frame and we will use Time Synchronization Function TSF\time stamps for estimating the clock skews of AP. The use of beacons has several advantages Fake access point detection scenario Beacon Frame Structure Let us assume that a finger-printer node \(a WIDS node\ has received n beacon frames from a particular AP. Let the time stamp in the ith beacon frame be Ti and let ti be the time in microsecond when the finger-printer receives the ith beacon frame. Finger-printer captures beacon frames sent by the fingerprinted AP The beacon frames captured using a passive scanning approach from the wireless network and extracted the timestamp information from frames to determine its accuracy  Second, the granularity of 802.11 TSF timers is 1 microsecond which is much higher than that of TCP time stamp clocks 3 726 R ELATED WORK  Rogue Access Points is authorized access point which is present in WLAN V       2014 International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development INDIACom     VI A B 6 1 M ETHODOLOGY  Number footnotes separately in superscripts In an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLAN, there are two methods that a client station \(STA\ may use to find an AP in the WLAN Active Scanning: The Client sends a probe request to AP to determine which APs are within range. The APs which are in range then reply back with probe response Passive Scanning: The STA learns about the APs in the WLAN by listening to the beacon frames broadcast by the APs The probe response and the beacon frames both have an 8 byte timestamp The time stamp field contains the value of TSF timer of the AP when it sends the frame. The beacons are scheduled to be sent at periodic intervals by the APs The time stamps in the beacon frames do not get affected by the random medium access delays of the wireless medium as hardware sets the time stamp value just before actual transmission. The 64 bit TSF timer of beacon frame initialized once at beginning and counter is incremented at ever microsecond. Our solution uses TSF time stamps in beacon/probe response frames to estimate the clock skew of an AP and uses the clock skew as the AP\220s fingerprint Fig. 3 


where 0 is such that is estimated as the clock skew of the clock offset-set. One of the major differences of LSF from LPM is its lack of tolerance toward outliers. Even if there are only a very few outliers, the clock skew estimated by LSF significantly from the clock-skew determined by the majority of the points. This can cause problems while estimating clock skew from noisy data. Kohno et al. decided not to use LSF for estimation of TCP clock skew because TCP segments can undergo random delays in the network which can affect the accuracy of the clock skew estimate. Therefore, we can use the LSF to estimate clock skews effectively LSF has an advantage over LPM in the scenario where an adversary tries to avoid detection by interspersing frames from a fake AP with the frames from the authorized one as described above. LSF\220s sensitivity to the presence of even a small number of outliers will help determining the fake AP in the above scenario more effectively than LPM. So, it will be difficult for the adversary to masquerade frames from the fake AP as outlying data when LSF is used to estimate the clock skew VII The beacon frames has \215timeval\216 field which is used to keep track of the time during communication in the network. By using \215timeval\216 field of beacon frame we can calculate the clock skew value of AP. A Fake AP usually copies the value for \215timeval\216 field from the source beacon frame. It takes nearly the same clock skew from the authorized AP But if authorized AP reconstruct the beacon frame, and retransmit it, then the delay of a few microseconds is injected But the sequence number of reconstructed frame is different one than original one, so here we come to know that this is fake AP Let Si= be the total size of the ith beacon frame Ri = be the data rate at which ith beacon frame is sent Therefore, the time, according to the AP\220s clock, when the finger-printer receives the packet is Ti  + Si/Ri Let our estimated offset for the ith frame be denoted oi and the time difference between the first received frame and the ith frame according to the finger-printer\220s clock be Xi. Then Xi=ti-t1   1  Oi = \(\(Ti+Si/Ri\-\(T1+S1/R1\\-\(ti-t1  2 In most of the cases, the beacon frames are sent at a fixeddata rate and the size of the beacon frames remain fixed as well. So, we can assume that Si / Ri =S1/R1 These yields Oi = \(Ti-T1\-\(ti-t1\                                                          \(3 For calculating clock skew from off-set, we can use two method first one is linear-programming-based method \(LPM and second one is a least-square fit \(LSF\ method as the clock skew estimate, so our clock skew estimation is the slope of the line and is the slope of the line and 2014 International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development INDIACom 1/n x   And the following function is minimized 4  The LPM method minimizes the effect of any unpredictable delays as it has higher tolerance toward outliers. Interestingly LPM\220s nature to tolerate the outliers may cause a serious security problem in our context [20  If an  adv ers ary is a b l e to  mix small number of beacons from a fake AP with the beacons of the authorized one, it is faking, and if the clock skew of the fake AP is close to the clock skew of authorized one. Then there may be chances that this method may consider the fake AP frames as outliers and estimate the clock skew of the authorized AP as the clock skew of the set [20 In th is c a se it  will be difficult to detect the fake AP by comparing the clock skews A B Linear Programming Method LPM finds a line 727 is the y-axis intercept, that upper bounds the points in the clock offset-set of the AP and outputs the slope of the line We can also use LSF to estimate the clock skew of an AP from its clock offset-set. Given an offset-set\(X1, O1 Xn,On\, LSF finds line is the y-intercept such that  5  Equation \(2\remains minimum.

The access point we have used is TP-LINK Least Square Fitting Method    Along with this we have used MadWifi driver and for running this on windows we have used TCP Dump\220s deemed version We use wireless card\204 Intel PRO. The Intel PRO card uses an Atheros chipset that works with the MadWifi driver. We chose this card because it support the monitor mode and also because their drivers are open source. The availability of the source code allows us to modify the drivers to measure the arrival time of beacon frames with higher resolution as described below. As the success of our methodology is closely tied to how precisely we can measure time, most of our implementation effort targets obtaining high-precision time measurements. In order to accurately estimate the clock skew of an AP, we need to precisely measure the time when a beacon frame reaches the wireless LAN card of the finger printer. For Windows we have used jNetpcap application and wincap .Wincap which is used to lift our application so that we can access and records the beacon frames  0 


and consistent increment. Thus, two consecutive points threshold  2014 International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development INDIACom in the clock offset-set are considered to be a jump if and only if   can be estimated empirically from the clock offset-set of a single AP. Our results show that the value of threshold estimated by timestamps. Our heuristic identifies these jumps and differentiates the data based on it. We exploit this fact to differentiate packets from different APs Let be the between two samples in the clock offset-set, \(Xi, Yi\d \(Xj, Yj and    400 29.17 ppm 26.86  ppm A 728 No. of packets examined Clock skews estimation Skew\(Using LPM Skew\(Using LSF  Wincap application uses the TCP-Dump application and Madwifi-driver for accessing the Beacon Frames Therefore, the clock skew of an AP can be estimated quickly and accurately with a 1 microsecond\220s precision clock at finger printer\220s end VIII Xi, Yi Xj, Yj is defined as follows to differentiate between jump C LOCK S KEWS E STIMATION  is the absolute value? We introduce a tunable parameter called threshold threshold E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  We use experimental traces from our laboratory settings to test our methodology for detecting unauthorized APs. First we have collected set of trace data during the experimental setting We have one authorized access point named as TP-LINK We have created one unauthorized access point. Any laptop connected to authorize access point which intimate original beacon frames and act as Access Point. Like if we will make a Laptop as WIFI hotspot. When we start WIFI hotspot which is connected to Authorized Access Point will itself send beacon frames and act as Access Point for Laptops in its range We have put our implementation for detection of fake Access point on one laptop which is also called as WIDS node The task of WIDS node is to continuously monitor the WLAN for detecting the fake access point. We have store authorized access point clock skews values as its fingerprint on one machine. And this data is use for differentiate between fake AP from Authorized Access point.The below shown result of LPM and LSF method of clock skews are measure in part per million unit \(ppm TABLE I Differentiating Frames of Fake Access Point   Where Using this definition of jump we can segregate the clock offset-set data into separate .Once the datasets are separated using the above heuristic, we can use either LPM or LSF based methods to estimate the exact clock skew of different fake APs In graph shown below the red slop line determined the clock skew of authorized AP. This clock skew is calculated at the time of testing done in laboratory. This value is stored in database The blue line is clock skew value of AP for which we want to determine whether it is authorized or fake. Once we have estimated the clock skew of that AP, we will compare this data with authorized data stored in database If the blue line is above the red line then it is unauthorized AP. If the blue line is below the red line then authorized AP is detected In below shown graph, the blue line is below the red line so authorized AP is detected   200 11.033 ppm 34.71  ppm 100 30.29 ppm 19.74 ppm 300 24.10 ppm 51.86 ppm relative skew We Differentiation between the clock offset-sets of the fake AP\(s\d the authorized AP \(if present\ill help us to detect fake AP For example, if the attacker uses multiple fake APs to fake one authorized AP, we can detect the fake APs by separating the clock offset-sets. However, the main disadvantage of GHT is that it is computationally rigorous and requires a big amount of storage. Even though techniques like Randomized Hough Transform \(RHT\ry to minimize these effects But the Randomized Hough Transform \(RHT\ still require large amount of time. The use of GHT is justified in the domain of image processing and computer graphics because images normally contain large number of edges and GHT can detect all of them together. However, in our case we expect to have very few lines. Algorithm requires the initial parameters to be guessed and the accuracy of the results depend on the values of those initial parameters. Furthermore, EM requires multiple iterations to converge. In our problem domain, we have some specific characteristics of the data that help the APs. The general problem of fitting multiple lines to a data set is not new. In the domain of computer vision and image processing Generalized Hough Transform \(GHT\ is a well-known technique that can be used for this purpose. Another approach to solve the problem of fitting multiple lines to a data set is to model the data as a mixture model and apply the well known statistical method of expectation maximization \(EM\ to separate the data The thickness of the lines in the clock offset-set plot \(i.e the variance of the points in the set\remains mostly constant across the APs The amount of noise in the data is negligible. Keeping these facts in mind and borrowing ideas from both of the above mentioned methods; we design a lightweight heuristic that solves our problem efficiently. Our heuristic relies on the fact that if a clock offset-set is calculated from the beacons received from different APs, then the clock skew will contain certain i.e., sudden big changes in the value\ at the boundary.

We have existing techniques for detecting rogue AP, but that technique has certain kinds of limitation. Disadvantage of manual Radio Frequency is that. RF scanning requires more time and it is tedious, which Detect rogue AP only, when scanning is applied. RF scanning method is also do impact on the costing and also it is not so effective and accurate. Automatic scanning depend on signs of APs \(viz. MAC address, SSID, etc.\hich is ineffective when a rogue AP spoofs signatures. But our approach, rogue AP detection with clock skew method overcome this drawbacks and prove effective and robust method of detecting rogue access point We have mainly focused on identifying wireless vulnerabilities and security threats for the end users and finding solution to combat them. This work provides solution for the problem of how to handle it. Some of the future work. We want to do in this, to enhance the features of the research work line such as developing and implementing an independent location finding techniques to track down the location of the wirelessdevices with other parameters.We also would like to make a complete intrusion detection system by implementing more detection programs for different attacks available on WLAN R EFERENCES  1 Prof S.B.Vanjale , Ms.Snehal Behede \215Providing Data Security for WiFi network using mobile agent in distributed system\216 in International Journal of Advanced  Engineering Technology, IJAET/Vol.III/ Issue II/April-June, 2012

Further, larger studies are desirable to better assess the performances and the scalability of the proposed approach 4. EMERGING RESEARCH DIRECTIONS Driven by bioinformatics, where the Granger causality test is largely used to derive causal relationships among different elements, such as genes and proteins, we have developed a novel change impact analysis method that uses the Granger causality test to learn impact relationships among software artifacts. The main idea of the method is to infer the mutual dependencies between software artifacts by measuring the statistical con?dence that the time series representing the history of changes of a software artifact can be used to predict the changes of another artifact. The problem is therefore posed as a statistical test, evaluating the quality 


of forecasting of a variable given another one In this paper the method has been compared with the application of association rules [9, 10], and the preliminary results suggest that the Granger causality test can be a viable approach to change impact analysis, as it complements existing approaches. As a matter of fact, while association rules capture co-changes, Granger causality helps learning consequent changes. While not shown in this paper for the sake of space, we have compared the results of the proposed impact analysis method against traditional methods based on static analysis, and also in this case we found that they are able to highlight complementary, yet useful, impact relationships. This opens the way towards an eclectic impact analysis approach that combines existing methods, to overcome the limitation of the individual methods, and provides software engineers with a richer set of information useful to assess the impact of a change There are several directions in which the work presented here can be expanded. Of course, a ?rst direction is the development of further empirical studies to fully understand advantages and limitation of the proposed method, to compare it with other \(traditional and to develop heuristics for improvement The application of Granger causality depends entirely on the appropriate selection of variables. In this paper we have used an impulsive \(0,1 in a snapshot. However, other variables should be explored for example the variation of some metric values. Furthermore, the method could be applied for object-oriented system, considering classes and methods instead of functions We are interested to compare the Granger causality approach against the dynamic Bayesian network inference, which is a well-known approach used to derive causal relationships. Finally, we are investigating the use of information theoretic approaches based on mutual information 5. REFERENCES 1] R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. N. Swami.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
