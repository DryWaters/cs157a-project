Abstract 
 
In the age of information technology it has given more and more scope of using available technology for various applications, which has give rise to information volume and database size. With the enormous amount of data stored in the form of files \(text and images\ video and multimedia it is required to have some advanced techniques to explore the database. Data mining is the method of extracting valuable information from the enormous amount of data saved in the database and files. At that time basically two important reasons that are used in data mining. first our capacity to accumulate and store the large amount of data is fast increase day by day and second but the most imperative basis is the need to turn

such data into useful information and knowledge. Association rule mining is a vital procedure to find out hidden interaction with items in the transaction. This paper describes   new technique cluster based Master-Slave architecture. It uses Hybrid technique, the grouping of bottom up and top down technique    for   search   repetitive   item sets. It reduces the time in use to get out the support count of the item sets. The Prime number show present offers the give for verify rules and provides decrease in   the data complexity Keywords: Association rule mining, database, master-slave 
 
I INTRODUCTION 
 
Data mining refers to extract or 215mining\216 215knowledge from large amounts of data\216. Data mining should have been 
more suitably named knowledge mining from data. [1 T h e r e are many other terms carrying a similar or slightly different meaning to data mining, such as knowledge mining from databases, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging. Data mining is a widely-used technique for discovering information from large databases within which \217association rules discovery\220, is one of the most popular technologies. It was first formulated in 1993 by Agrawal et al. [1  A y e ar l ate r  A p r i o r i, o n e o f th e mo s t  noticeable algorithms, was proposed by the same authors Over the next few years, studies on improvements or extensions of Apriori have been extensive. Many modifications to Apriori have been done. Cluster-based 
technique creates cluster tables by scanning the database once in a time  T h e  a l go r i t hm 220s s uppo r t c o un t  i s  performed on the cluster table and it need not scan all transactions stored in the cluster table   II PROBLEM DEFINITION AND RELATED WORK  Data mining normally involves four classes of task classification, clustering, regression, and association rule learning. This algorithm finds the frequent itemsets or patterns by partitioning the database transactions into clusters. Clusters are designed based on the comparison measurement among the communication. Then after find out the frequent itemsets. With the transactions in t h e  
clusters and items openly v i a  improved Apriori algorithm which supplementary reduces the number of amount s c a n s in the database and that's why improve the proficiency. When buy the product when another product is buy presents to the association rules. [7  T h e A p r io r i algorithm perform only find out the frequent itemsets. The Apriori algorithm is the base for association rules These  technique have  been  planned  to  consider  and recognize  the executive  implications of a spectrum of tradeoffs between calculation, conversation, usage of memory synchronizing, and the use of particular problem-specific information   data mining in parallel. [3   The problem of mining association rules could be 
decomposed into two sub problems of 
Find out all large itemsets or patterns and their support counts. A large itemset or patterns is a set of items which are contained in a sufficiently large number of transactions, with respect to a support threshold minimum support 
  
 
The set of greatest itemsets or patterns catch, find it all there association rules that have a confidence value beyond a confidence threshold value lowest Since the solution of the second sub problem is basic, here we are concentrating only on the first sub problem Clustering is a data mining technique used to position data elements into related groups without advance knowledge

group definitions. Clustering can be consider the most essential unsupervised learning problem; so, as every further problem of this kind, it deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data. A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are \215similar\216 between them and are \215dissimilar\216 to the objects belonging to other clusters  This example demonstrates the clustering of balls of the same mark. Figure 1 show a total of ten balls which are

of three differen t marks    Figure 1 Balls with marks in random order  We are interested in grouping the balls into three clusters by their marks as shown in figure 2   Figure2.  B a l l s  in groups  The partition algorithm is based in the study that the frequent sets are normally very few in number compared to the set of all item sets. By  using  partitioning,  cluster  based and/or  distributed  technique can  be  easily  created,  where each partitioning might be handle by a separate machine In order to find the Largest item set it is enough to go through the transactions with in the clusters T h e c l us t e r t ha t  ha s  the full amount  of transactions smaller than some threshold cost will be deleted. For finding the greatest item sets it is sufficient to go through the transactions with  the clusters There is no need to go through the entire database again Hence it compresses the unnecessary database scan and better the efficiency. If we apply the master slave architecture after portioning it will further reduces the number of scans and improves efficiency   III MASTER SLAVE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN  This technique is based on Cluster based Master-Slave structural design using candidate division technique Candidate division technique reduces the communication overhead between master and slave nodes Candidate division technique assigns the candidate item sets generated from different parts of database to different processors   and   each   processor   is   assigned disjoint candidates, independent of further processors T he  Master node prunes the transactions by removing 1 infrequent itemsets and stores the Prime number multiple for each transaction in mutual memory. It finds the maximal length transaction size Maxlength and puts in mutual memory. It divides the transactions equally to each node for candidate generation. Though horizontal partition, Vertical partition techniques can be used to divide a division the transactions, horizontal partitioning technique is adopted, as it demands minimum communication t h e r e a r e S  number of slaves and T number of transactions, then T/S number of transactions are assigned to each slave if T is a integral  multiple of S. Otherwise, S-1 slaves will be assigned T/S transactions and S th slave will be assigned T/S + mod \(T/S\\ transactions Master connects to each slave node and initiates the process of finding the frequent itemset. Finally, the master node shows the global frequent itemsets after gathering the local frequent itemsets. After the Master node initiates the slave node, it reads the allotted number of transactions and Maximal length transaction size Maxlength     Fig.3 Master Slave structural design  Figure 4 is shows the flow chart of this proposed technique first that are used in the data set then after assign prim no then modulo division operation ,then the result is non zero the item is not found and the result is zero the item is present Then last process is interrupt   Fig.4.Flow chart on proposed method  IV PROPOSED TECHNIQUE   A new approach for Frequent Item sets using cluster based master slave structural design efficient approach is being proposed. This technique integrates both the bottom up explore as well as the top-down explore. This technique is suitable for itemsets data base. The top down technique u s e d to find the frequent subsets of itemsets and this bottom up technique to find the supersets of the frequent itemsets. Most of the technique for mining the frequent

items is based on bottom-up search technique. In this approach, the technique starts from 1 itemsets and extends one stage in each pass until all maximum frequent item sets are found. These techniques perform fit if the length of the maximum itemset is short. If the maximum itemset is longer top down technique is suitable for a transaction with a normal sized assigned a   exclusive prime number as shown in table 1 maximum frequent set; a combination of both these techniques performs fit. This technique adopts Candidate partition technique to allocate the candidates among all nodes. The Prime number illustration reduces the memory needed for store the items of the transactions by conveying an exclusive prime number for each item. This technique uses prime numbers correspond to the items in this transaction. Each item is specify a exclusive prime number Each Transaction of data base is   the product of the corresponding prime number of specific items in the transaction, while the product of the prime number is exclusive, modulo division operation of a transaction\220s prime product.  The prime product result of the item set can assure the occurrence or nonexistence of the item set in any transaction. If the residue is zero, then the item set is event in the transaction. If the residue is Non-zero, then the item set is nonexistence in the transaction

There are two conditions occurs, are as follows If the support count is larger than or equal to the support count\(minimum\, it is treat as the maximum frequent item set and the process terminated. If the support count for the itemsets of  time slave  A is  smaller  than  the    support count\(minimum\,  the subsets of time-slave equal to P=A/2 is produce and their support count is recognize Experimental result: If the modulo division operation gives a zero residue, it indicates that the items or item pattern is in the transaction.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a new Approach for cluster based master slave structural design was proposed. The innovative Prime number representation stores only one number for each transaction, it may need less memory. The computational complexity is reduced as the product of their assigned prime numbers represents each candidate item set. The pruning of infrequent items in the first scan reduces the size of the dataset in the main memory. Large transaction database including a great number of item set will generate. The use of traditional technique will be difficult to meet the new demand for data mining, so the new data mining algorithm proposed in this paper is meaningful. This paper increase data mining efficiency significantly. This master -and-slave technique can solve the algorithm space problem  REFERENCES  1  R   A g r a w a l  a n d  R  Sr ik a n t    F a s t A l g o r i t h m s  f o r  Mi n i n g  A s s o c i a t i o n               Rules in Large Database,"Proc. 20th Int'l Conf.

  RQ3: Can different clusters be observed in distinct settings and can help us for system refactoring We conduct an exploratory study to investigate the above questions by means of a case study. The analysis techniques that we have explored in this work prove to be useful for addressing these research questions. Obviously, mining association rules is able to help reveal hidden dependences among program elements in source code. The answer to RQ2 is that the measures of associations are to summarize the relations by summing up the numbers of strong association rules. This solution might be too simple and should be solved with a better measure. We consider it as one future work to improve. The answer to RQ3 is that we use the visualization technique comparing the associations among related clusters and program elements, it is possible for suggesting system refactoring by investigating the thickness of lines between two nodes Second, the large volume of information and complexity of dynamic information makes it hard to understand the system runtime behaviors and infer higher level of information. In our experiment, the choice of use cases is one of the primary factors that affect the experiment results. So it is better to derive a balanced set of use cases just like the experiment results shown in Section IV. But this may require a great deal of manual decision to choose distinct use cases for yielding better results. Obviously, complete coverage is not necessary However, this is necessary for understanding complete structural intents. Adopting just enough use cases will help us improve the experiment result effectively Third, utilizing strong association rules to build the dependencies to depict the relations among inter-clusters and intra-clusters and deal with system entities and associations as nodes and edges is an exploratory study. However, the work needs to be improved by setting various weight standards and to build appropriate metric parameters. A proper weight should reflect the invoked times of program elements and the association values among elements with the goal to identify the important types of dependences VII  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  The main goal of this research is to provide maintainers an overview of the software and the relations in order to facilitate structure analysis. Therefore clustering and association mining technique are employed. By doing so, reengineers are able to get a rough and quick view of a legacy system at first, and then further utilize rules to identify hidden relationships among different program units such as method calls and classes etc Besides, the approach uses clustering technique to study dynamic dependencies under maintenance to determine the roles of software entities play in a system. So it is possible for maintainers to understand the system at a higher level. For association rules mining, use case scenarios are mapped to trace transactions and rules are extracted from the events through a number of scenarios. Strong association rules can identify dependences by setting a threshold which greater than a minimum support threshold value and a minimum confidence threshold value. Thus these relations can help find issues in system construction which likely need a potential refactoring Overall, the contributions of this paper are i proposing an approach for program comprehension through association rule mining analysis ii demonstrating the visualization technique comparing the dependences within clusters and system entities Our future work mainly includes: \(1\ combining dynamic analysis with systems structural model, e.g. program-element dependencies for enriching the semantic information \(2 erecting the metric evaluation for different association rules and setting right weights for each edge correlation, and \(3 conducting systematic empirical studies on the choice of the appropriate parameters for the proposed approach R EFERENCES  1  Dapeng Liu, Andrian Marcus, Denys Poshyvanyk, Vaclav Rajlich Feature location via information retrieval based filtering of a single scenario execution trace. 22nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering \(ASE 2007\, November 5-9, 2007 Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

The minimum confidence peak s at 1.00 at  2 to 5 days Compared to our earlier study  37  which only utilizes experts knowledge the combina tion of EM algorithm-based discretization and Apriori algor ithm shows improvement in 1.292% of minimum confidence Figure 8 shows the number of new rules added or upd ated with increasing window size.  A total of 7 rules we re added with a window size of one day and a total of 19 rul es in Table IV were updated with a window size of 5 days   No rules were added or updated with a look-back window  of more than 5 days Compared with earlier study resul ts in 37   a  l a r g e r  a m o u n t  o f  d a t a   5 4 6  d a t a  i n   3 7   a n d 1117 data in this study after data cleaning and the EM algor ithmbased discretization yields more rules with larger size of sliding window from the Apriori algorithm The total number of patient tasks was reduced by up  to 76.19 with negligible information loss The reduct ion in patient tasks allows the system to generate additio nal tasks for patients to increase information gain For exam ple as shown in Table IV it was found that responses to Q 3 and Q4 can be inferred from each other. This allows the system to generate a new unrelated question to replace Q3 to learn additional information about this patient with no added work by the patient Compared with the algorithm in 46   t h e  d e v e l o p e d  Figure 7.

algorithm shows higher efficiency However since F lach's algorithm finds new rules that the developed algori thm doesn't generate, they can be used for generating h elpful tips or reminders  VI  C ONCLUSION  The WANDA system was developed in conjunction with the University of California Los Angeles Computer S cience and the UCLA Ronald Regan Medical Center WANDA monitors health-related readings such as blood gluc ose weight blood pressure etc and analyzes sensor re adings and patient profile data for improving the quality of care and preventing emergency situations In this study, we developed WANDA, a three tier rem ote health monitoring system and focused on increasing ease of use in order to improve patients system adherence  The developed system applies EM-based data discretizati on and Apriori rule learning algorithms and finds associat ion rules using collected sensor readings with dynamic slidin g windows We assumed that sensor readings from patie nts are Gaussian mixture and quantize continuous featur es and applied Apriori algorithm which efficiently finds r elated data using support values The designed algorithm minimizes the number of action items and reorganize s series of tasks for maximizing information gain In this work we applied the developed algorithms t o 1117 data sets from 21 patients with diabetes enrol led in the intervention arm. Patients are required to measure their blood sugar up to three times a day and answer four quest ionnaires daily The experimental results show that the devel oped algorithm can reduce the number of tasks by up to 7 6.19 with minimum support 0.95 minimum confidence 0.95  minimum conditional probability 0.85 and maximum ti me window size of 5 days Compared to our earlier stud y 37   the EM-based discretization helps improve confidenc e levels of first order logics and predict further events. A s the Apriori algorithm has excellent scale-up properties 45   t he developed algorithm can be applied to the remote pa tient with low complexity Future studies will investigate and validate the significance of the obtained first order logic rule s in this paper. To make the first-order logic richer to redu ce required patient tasks dynamically, more data association ru le mining techniques will be exploited and maximize the condi tional probability and confirmation. In addition, patient survey data will be combined to predict adherence rate in advan ce, based on their perception and experience of remote health  monitoring technologies  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by NIH/National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Training Program Grant T15 LM07356 The authors would like to thank Nancy Lee  Rose Healy, Florence-Joy Figueras, Jane Lee, and To ni Ann Riveros for their help in patient recruitment and a dvice Tannaz Moin was an endocrinology fellow in the UCLA  Department of Medicine Division of Endocrinology Diabetes  Hypertension and is now a health service s research fellow supported by VA Office of Academic Affiliations Health Services Research and Developm ent through the Health Services Fellowship Training Pro gram TMP 65-020\, VA Greater Los Angeles  R EFERENCES  1  CDC Centers for disease control and prevention http://www.cdc.gov/. 2012 2  Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research G roup.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
