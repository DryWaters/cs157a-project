In order to solve the problem of Knowledge Discovery in Database, great importance has been continuously attached to the data mining. In this paper, we elaborate the Particularities and Key issues of data mining in biomedicine analyze and summarize the application research of data mining in the biomedicine domain, point out the few application reason of data mining in the biomedicine domain Index Terms Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery Biomedicine  I   I NTRODUCTION  With the technology development of research and measuring instruments in biomedical engineering, it becomes possible to record a huge amount of medical information precisely. This leads to the exploration of the medical data. The application of Hospital Information System \(HIS\so makes it possible to build complete Electronic Healthcare Record \(EHR which including not only objective physiological values and medical images, such as X-ray, Ultrasound B and CT, but also plenty of detailed patientês background information, such as age, gender, height, weight and previous medical history. The characteristic of these data are: rich in classes, heterogeneity in essential and valuable for disease diagnosis, treatment, and research. However, it is far beyond the capacity and speed of traditional analysis to understand, analysis and deal with these information. This shortage becomes the bottle-neck of investigation and application in biomedicine. Biomedicine database existing the phenomenon of çdata rich, information pooré. In order to solve the problem of Knowledge Discovery in Database\(KDD\ , a great importance has been continuously attached to the Data Mining\(DM\ Data Mining is a cross subject which covers machine learning, mathematical statistics neutral network, database, pattern recognition, rough sets fuzzy mathematics and relative technologies. The Data Mining in biomedical database can help us with disease diagnosis treatment, research and decision making, by discovering the rules and mode of medical diagnosis. The research on building an experimental platform of syndrome differentiation research based on data mining technology is done by YAN Jun-feng. It expresses that implementing TCM\(Traditional Chinese Medicine\ diagnosis research taking the unified architecture of symptoms, syndrome elements and differentiation as a break through point, is an achievable objective II  S OME K EY I SSUES OF D ATA M INING IN B IOMEDICINE D ATABASE  Data Mining is the process of abstracting unaware, potential and useful information and knowledge from plentiful incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic data. The form of abstracted knowledge can be concept, rules, regulations, tends and mode. The implementation methods need both special data structure and algorithm. The algorithms of currently used data mining are: statistic method, decision tree, evolutionary algorithm, neural network, fuzzy logic, association rule, rough set, support vector machine and nearest neighbors algorithm However, the particularity of data mining in biomedicine database is due to its privacy, polymorphism, incompleteness timeliness and redundancy, which means that the method of doing this should differ a lot with that of regular ones A  Preprocess of data Preprocessing of data mainly includes issues about shortage, redundancy, inconsistent and outdated of data through the methods of data cleaning, data transforming and data reducing. Biomedicine database needs data preprocessing because it always containing noise, incomplete, inconsistent data information B  Anonymousness and identification transformation Besides data preprocessing, in order to separate the relative between patients and their records which may referenced some private information, anonymousness and identification transformation are also needed C  Standardization of text data Standardization of text data is needed for mining biomedical information; otherwise, it will become hard to do data mining on expertsê explanation of images, signals or other kinds of clinical data D  Information fusion technology Biomedicine database is composed by words, data, signals images and some voice & video signals. Different technologies and measures should be taken to deal with these databases with 978-1-4244-6005-2/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE The 5th International Conference on Computer Science & Education Hefei, China.

with the Alignment and NQueens benchmarks Results are similar with both versions Although a deeper analysis will be needed the results suggest two main hypothesis 017 The Intel Compiler does not implement thread switching and thus untied tasks cannot bene\002t from this feature which should avoid imbalances This is particularly evident in the Alignment benchmark which has been reported to scale 017 Task scheduling constraints do not seem to impact signi\002cantly the performance results at most there is a 4 difference between the versions The other applications show a similar behavior D Other opportunities for analysis The Intel Compiler does not implement mechanisms that allow the user choose among different task scheduling policies but other OpenMP compilers e 16 that have such capabilities One interesting study is to 002nd how task scheduling policies and how they can mantain locality across tasks can affect the performance results of the benchmarks of the suite In previous sections we have discussed how implementing a cut-off mechanism can affect application performance but we have not discussed due to space limitations how the different cut-off values i.e at which point in the recursion we cut relate with the creation of parallelism and the overall performance Choosing a low cut-off value can restrict parallelism opportunities but choosing a high cut-off value can saturate the system with a large amount of tasks which have no thread available to execute them The right choice depends many times of the input data set Comparing the application behaviour using different cut-off values or testing runtime features which allow to modify dynamically the cut-off can also be interesting analyses The quality of implementations for different task generation schemes e.g in the SparseLU benchmark which can use a single or multiple generator scheme taskwait constructs or other task related implementation details could also be analyzed with our benchmark suite proposal V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE WORK We have presented BOTS  Barcelona OpenMP Task Suite  built with the double motivation of coping with the great characteristics of the multicore processors and offer a set of benchmarks to evaluate OpenMP tasking We think that BOTS will help implementors and programmers to have a better understanding of the OpenMP tasking model and its performance implications Each of these benchmarks comes also with different versions to test different aspects of the tasking model For example they can be used to evaluate task scheduling alternatives tiedness   Also a number of input sets are provided so that benchmarks can be used as tests or really stress the processors and memory system in your machine It is interesting to note that we have tried to select benchmarks with diverse characteristics In this paper we have highlighted the differences and we have shown their evaluation on an SGI Altix machine with up to 32 processors and we report some of their characteristics per task e.g operations memory writes    Their evaluation also shows that there is plenty of work to do at all levels  architecture compiler runtime system programming model to improve certain benchmarks given that their current scalability is very limited This suite can be used to obtain useful data of the strenghts and weaknesses of an OpenMP implementation that can help developers to improve it Currently we are working to add new benchmarks to the suite to cover more problem domains and scenarios We are as well planning to do a full cross-vendor evaluation to 002nd which is the current state of the OpenMP tasking implementations A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation contracts no TIN2007-60625 and CSD2007-00050 the European Commission in the context of the SARC project contract no 27648 the HiPEAC Network of Excellence contract no IST-004408 the IBM CAS Program and the Mare Incognito project under the BSC-IBM collaboration agreement R EFERENCES  O ARB OpenMP Applicati on Program Interf ace v  3.0  May 2008  J M Bull Measuring Synchronizati on and Scheduling Ov er heads in OpenMP in First European Workshop on OpenMP  September 1999  LLNL OpenMP Performance Suite Description 2001 A v ailable https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/RTS Report/openmp perf.html  A Dorta C Rodriguez F  de Sande and A Gonzalez The OpenMP Source Code Repository Euromicro Conference on Parallel Distributed and Network-Based Processing  vol 0 pp 244ñ250 2005  C Bienia S K umar  J P  Singh and K Li The P ARSEC Benchmark Suite Characterization and Architectural Implications in Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques  2008 pp 72ñ81  H Jin M Frumkin and J Y an The OpenMP Implementation of NAS Parallel Benchmarks and Its Performance NASA Ames Research Center Technical Report NAS-99-011 1999 A v ailable citeseer.ist.psu.edu/408248.html
