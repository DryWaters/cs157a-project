High Productivity Data Processing Analytics Methods with Applications  M. Riedel  A.S. Memon  and M.S. Memon    Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich Supercomputing Centre, Juelich, Germany  University of Iceland/School of Natural Sciences and Engineering, Reykjavik, Iceland m.riedel@fz-juelich.de   Abstract - The term \221big data analytics\222 emerged in order to engage in the ever increasing amount of scientific and engineering data with genera l analytics techniques that support the often more domain-specific data analysis process. It is recognized that the big data challenge can only 
be adequately addressed when knowledge of various different fields such as data mining, machine learning algorithms, parallel processing, and data management practices are effectively combined. This paper thus describes some of the \221smart data analytics methods\222 that enable a high productivity data processing of large quantities of scientific data in order to enhance the data analysis efficiency. The paper thus aims to provide new insights how various fields can be successfully combined Contributions of this paper include the concretization of the cross-industry standard proce ss for data mining \(CRISPDM\ocess model in scientific environments using concrete machine learning algo rithms \(e.g. support vector machines that enable data cl 
assification mechanisms \(e.g. outlier detection in measurements\erial and parallel approaches to specifi c data analysis challenges are discussed in the context of concrete earth science application data sets. Solutions also include various data visualizations that enable a better insight in the corresponding data analytics and analysis process I  I NTRODUCTION  221Understanding climate change, finding alternative energy sources, and preserving the health of an ageing population are all cross-disciplinary problems that require high-performance data storage, smart analytics transmission and mining to solve\222 1 t ific  disciplines face huge challenge 
s in data processing with the ever increasing amount of scientific data [1,2 Thi s  raises the demand for 221smart data analytics methods\222  which are required to provide a very concrete set of tools techniques, frameworks, and infrastructures in order to perform 221big data analytics\222 with real data sets. This is one of the important elements of data-intensive scie  among others such as preserving and managing large-scale data sets for their 221active re-use\222 e.g. in-situ validations with real measurement data sets during a computational simulation on large-scale computing resources In order to effectively perform data-intensive science it is important \(i\o understand its relationship to other 
important and closely related concepts \(e.g. machine learning algorithms, data mining practices, etc.\\(ii\ to understand what are the fu ndamental techniques for efficiently using available resources \(e.g. high performance computing, high throughput computing, big data sharing and access, etc Hence, by considering \(i and \(ii\want to achieve a 221high productivity data processing\222 using a systematic approach and thus refine with this term the often generally used term \221big data analytics\222 with concrete methods. A wide variety of data analysis and analytics were arbitrary but we require a principled and systematic set of methods that guides the 221smart data analytics processes\222 This enters the field of process models such as the Cross Industry Standard 
Process for Data Mining \(CRISP-DM  W e re qui re  221innovative perspectives on data\222 as described by Provost  m e ntions that a 221data-science perspective provides practitioners with structure and principles which give the data scientist a framework to systematically treat problems of extracting useful knowledge from data\222 This is particularly useful when the general data analytics step \(performed by data scientists precedes the often scientific do main-specific data analysis In earlier work [6 y g a v e in sig h t s in to  several concrete 221big data processing approaches\222 e.g iterative map-reduce, scientific workflows, databases massively-parallel processing algorithms, visualization 
and steering, etc rage in the context of largescale computing \(e.g. PRACE  infrastructures \(e.g. EUDAT  This pape r g o es a step  further in disentangling the set of closely interrelated 221big data analytics concepts\222 described above in order to understand which techniques can be applied on which compute and storage resources to solve one specific data science problem. We provide methods in the context of two concrete data-intensive science case studies from the earth science domain we work with in a systematic fashion using CRISP-DM and selected algorithms and resources: \(a\tlier detection [21 in  measu r e m en t  devices data, and \(b\a classification of m u l t i spectral images 
This paper is structured as follows. After the introduction to the problem domain, Section II provides a background to the concrete earth science data sets in question and briefly surveys systematic ways to perform 221data science\222 with selected required concrete techniques Section III offers the reader then methods in context of our two case studies well embedded in the overall systematic way of performing a high productivity processing of data The paper ends with some concluding remarks of several findings and outlines future work elements MIPRO 2014, 26-30 May 2014, Opatija, Croatia 289 


II  B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK  A wide variety of process models exist that bear the potential to support \221smart data analytics processes\222 with a concrete structure that often refer to \221phases\222 with certain 221steps\222. CRISP-DM [4 cf. Fig u r e 1  is th e m o s t su itab l e one that we refined for our \(parallel\mart data analytics since it clearly outlines 221six concrete phases\222 that are typical for a data mining project a\ problem/business understanding; \(b\ data understanding; \(c\ data preparation; \(d\ modeling; \(e\ evaluation; \(6\ deployment  Given the page restriction, we summarize them only briefly based on the CRISP-DM user guide i n cl u d i ng refinements towards 221smart data analytics\222 but would like to emphasize that we perform our work on the scientific data case studies using the CRISP-DM as a useful backbone process. To the best of our knowledge, a generally accepted 221big data analytics process model\222 for science and engineering problems is not existing except disconnected approaches from several business domains e.g. predictive/customer an alytics processes, etc The 221\(a\ problem/business understanding phase\222  includes general steps \(aka tasks\h as determining the objectives and goals \(e.g. data analytics success criteria performing a situation assessment \(e.g. inventory of computing and storage resources\phase 221\(b\ data understanding\222 the tasks includes the creation of a couple of reports about the initial data \(collection and data sets including data \(collection\ption, exploration options, and data quality statements. The third phase 221\(c data preparation\222 refers to tasks that accurately described the data sets in question, their rational for inclusion/exclusion as well as required work on cleaning data or reformatting data if needed. The phase 221\(d modeling\222 includes the selection of modeling techniques test designs and related parameter settings to build the model.  This phase depends highly on the scientific question that drives the \221smart data analytics\222 process as well as the next phase 221\(e\ evaluation\222 which stands for several tasks related to assess the analytics results w.r.t the initial success criteria described in phase \(a\e final phase 221\(f\ deployment\222 enables a systematic way of performing analytics on a regular basis including a monitoring and maintenance plan. In our given context of 221smart data analytics\222 we apply the CRISP-DM process not as an iterative process, but rather as a cyclic one refining information and models of phases as required According to Marb\341n et al CRISPD M is the 221de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects\222 that was one of the facts influencing our decision to use the CRISP-DM as a backbone process for our 221smart data analytics\222 case studies. Another process model often mentioned in context and named after its phases is \221Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess \(SEMMA  m o stly driven by the SAS Institute. Although used in the business domain alongside a dedicated commercial tool it rather concentrates on the modeling tasks in data mining compared to CRISP-DM that includes a more comprehe nsive \221perspective\222 on the overall data analytics process After the introduction of the major structure of performing 221smart data analytics\222 in a systematic way, we briefly introduce our two data-intensive case studies in order to have a focus on relevant and concrete techniques required. The field \(and overlaps\f data mining, machine learning, knowledge discovery, and \(parallel\ data analysis & analytics is very large and thus we need to concentrate on two very specific problems given real world data sets. At the same time we face the challenge that many algorithms in the field of machine learning artificial intelligence, or data mining have not a long history in taking advantage of parallel and distributed computing techniques in the field of 221high performance computing \(HPC\\222 and 221high throughput computing HTC\\222 In this contribution, it is the rate of interconnection of computing nodes that differentiates HPC \(i.e. fast interconnect within clusters, e.g. Infiniband from HTC \(i.e. moderate interconnect, e.g. usual Ethernet as found in Grids and Cloud infrastructures today The first case study raises the demand to tackle the problem of 221automatic outlier/anomaly detection\222 in measurement data sets that are part of the PANGAEA data collection [12  W ith  7  9 b illi o n  d a ta ite m s 2 01 3   b e tter  sensor equipment during the years, and its constant growing factor contribute to name this data source as 221big data\222 Hodge present a good survey of principles in outlier detection referred to as different types 221Type 1 \226 Determine the outliers with no prior knowledge of the data \(unsupervised clustering\\222  221Type 2 226 Model both normality and abnormality \(supervised classification\\222  221Type 3 \226 Model only normality or in a very few cases model abnormality \(novelty detection and recognition\ \221 We re-use these principles, but require a more fine-grained perspective when tackling a concrete data set with more elaborate elements for parallel appr oaches t h an mentioned in [1  The second case study tackles the problem of 221classification of multi-spectral images\222 in data sets that are part of data collections acquired by the Quickbird satellite [14  Th is is ju st on e 221sensor\222 of many similar data sources that enable the study of changes in land usage, agricultural and forest climates. Experts refer to case studies like this as 221remote sensing science\222 that aims to interpret information using sensors that are not in direct physical contact with the object being observed Classification algorithms that work with these datasets have to treat both spectral and spatial information in order to obtain a satisfactory level of detection accuracy. A survey of related work in cla ssification principles is nicely summarized by Moguerza et al. in as fol l o ws  221support vector machines \(SVMs\ have increasingly turned into a standard methodology in the computer science and engineering communities\222   Figure 1  CRISP-DM process model modified from [9  290 


III  M ETHODS FOR S MART D ATA A NALYTICS  Innovative methods for smart data analytics require a solid foundational basis in order to enable a high productivity processing of 221big data\222 i.e. towards petabytes\er than being only usable with data sets of sizes that we often used in the past \(i.e. gigabytes terabytes\e therefore suggest that the methods are well embedded in a 221collaborative data infrastructure \(CDI\\222  design with additional services that optimize data access and provide added value with services that enable data sharing, persistence, and safe replication. In earlier work Riedel et al. [1  pr op osed a 221data infrastructure reference model\222 that follows a CDI approach and that consists of computing and storage resources relevant for our proposed concrete analytics methods. The design approach and some of its services \(e.g. the B2SAFE safe data replication service\plem ented as part of the EUDAT data infrastructure In contrast to the rath er elaborated reference architecture top-down work of the National Institute for Standard \(NIST\g data working group [1 we aim t o  provide in this contribution a bottom-up approach based on concrete scientific case studies and their required reference architecture elemen ts. In [6 e th er ef or e suggest a derived concrete architecture design tailored for 221big data analytics\222 in a context of a CDI while this section aims to refine this architectural setup based on concrete techniques and tools that are used in the context of two specific case studies. Scie ntific results of them are expected to be published in domain-specific publications and thus this paper focusses on the pure technical findings of combining a wide variety of available tools and frameworks for 221smart data analytics\222 Selected elements of the CRISP-DM process model tailored to our problem domain are given in context of the two case studies while full reports are already availabl e or expected to become available as part of the EUDAT data infrastructure A  Automatic outlier detection in measurement datasets By following the tailored CRISP-DM model phase 221 a\ problem/business understanding\222 we define the goal to automatically detect outliers in large quantities of measurement data, because manual 221quality control\222 is slow, error-prone, and become s increasingly impossible as the amount of data set grow significantly in type and volume. The architectural setup in Figure 2 illustrates selected parts of the inventory of computing and storage resources such as the PANG AEA collection archive \(i.e i.e computing nodes available at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre and UoIceland respectively Selected elements of phase \221 b\ data understanding\222 include the task to collect initial data out of the large PANGAEA data collection that in our case refers to initial measurement datasets acquired by a cabled underwater observatory sensor in the open Swedish Fjord Koljoe Fjord \(approximately 100 KM north of Gothenburg installed as part of the HYPOX2 project The dat a  sets are provided by PANGAEA data scientists that preserve and manage data sets in their own domainspecific data infrastructure The third phase 221\(c\ data preparation\222 includes tasks of describing the structure of the data. In our case study we work with datasets that consists of a time series of a month/file \(i.e. tab separated data files\th underwater measurements. We furthermore had to remove some metadata elements in the plain data files that created problems when using it with the R Statistical Computing tool [2  The phase 221\(d\ modeling\222 includes the selection of modeling techniques and in our case also the related appropriate outlier detection algorithms. There are currently two parallel approaches we explore as part of our \221smart data analytics\222 methods: \(i\sing the statistical computing tool R with the RMPI and outlier package \(cf Figure 2\ \(ii\ng a new implementation by G. Fox et al of the DOoR algorithm described by Bhaduri et al. in [2  The automation of the approach is provided by using a HPC middleware \(i.e. UNICORE [2  t pro v ided a  seamless access to large-scale supercomputers. R scripts and the execution of outlier algorithms are performed with this system using workbench tools \(cf. Figure 2  Figure 2  Architectural deployment for the automatic outlie r detection in PANGAEA measurement datasets 291 


The e\ evaluation\222 phase, which stands for several tasks related to assess the analytics results w.r.t. the initial success criteria described in phase \(a\s twofold: Firstly on a technical basis using data mining techniques secondly, results of the automatic outlier detection are regularly shared with scientific experts from PANGAEA by using the 221B2SHARE EUDAT Data Service\222 cf. Figure 2\hey evaluate which 221smart data analytics\222 elements make sense and what approaches are not helpful. In addition, often used outlier data visualizations are available \(e.g. normal probability plots, boxplots histograms\d to further support this process \(cf Figure 2 top right The final phase 221\(f\ deployment\222 enables a systematic way of performing automated outlier detection on PANGAEA datasets once the tests with initial datasets have been shown successful over time. This concrete 221smart data analytics method\222 is well embedded in a sustainable data infrastructur e offering storage resources and services mostly independent of project funding because of a network of trus ted data centers in EUDAT and PRACE B  Classification of multi-spectral images We start again with our tailored CRISP-DM process model, but perform a quicker walk-through as the ideas of each phase are the same, but the given data analytics problem is usually different. In phase \221 a problem/business understanding\222 we define the goal of performing a data classification of buildings in street map with high accuracy using multi-spectral image datasets These data sets constantly grow in volume and thus require a more powerful classification approach and thus we define a 221speed-up of data classification\222 as a clear objective in this particular case study. The architectural setup in Figure 3 illustrates selected parts of the inventory of computing and storage resources such as parts of the Quickbird satellite data collection \(i.e. community storage data sets\ resources \(i.e. computing nodes available at the UoIceland and as part of FutureGrid  respectively Phase \221 b\ data understanding\222 include the task to collect initial multi-spectral image data sets out of the large commercial Quickbird data collection that in our case is done by the domain scientists that work with us In the phase 221\(c\ data preparation\222 we perform tasks to describe the structure of the data. In our case study we work with datasets that are in fact different types of images acquired by the QuickBird satellite: \(i\ghresolution panchromatic image or resolution 0.6m and a low-resolution \(2.4m\ multi-spectral image The phase 221\(d\ modeling\222 includes the selection of modeling techniques and in our case also the related appropriate parallel data classification algorithm. As described above, one of the most commonly applied principle technique in data classification are support vector machines \(SVMs  is currently one parallel approach we explore as part of our \221smart data analytics\222 method: using Twister [25 as show n i n  Figure 3. Twister improves the original map-reduce  approach \(e.g. used in Apache Hadoop  wi t h i t e rat i v e capabilities, which can be used to train an SVM classifier as described by Zhang and Fox in [2 W e nee d t o  mention here that the implementation in turn is based on the widely known libSVM library [30  Also in this case study, the e\luation\222 phase is twofold: Firstly on a technical basis using machine learning techniques separating the labelled data in three distinct sets: training data, test data and validation data secondly, results of the data classification results are regularly shared with scientific experts by using the 221B2SHARE EUDAT Data Service\222 cf. Figure 3\ They evaluate which 221smart data analytics\222 elements make sense and what data classifiers have not enough accuracy In addition, visualizations are available \(e.g. speed-up diagrams compared to serial approaches\as needed to further indicate that the training time of the SVM classifier was significantly faster. This is especially the case when considering the observed used manual approaches by using Matlab SVMs [3   Figure 3  Architectural deployment for the data cla ssification using parallel support vector mach ines for Quickbird masurement datasets 292 


The final phase 221\(f\ deployment\222 enables a systematic way of performing data classification of multi-spectral image datasets once the tests with initial Quickbird image datasets have shown good accuracy of the trained parallel SVM classifiers. This concrete 221smart data analytics method\222 is well embedded in a sustainable data infrastructure offering comp uting and storage resources mostly independent of proj ect funding, because of a network of trusted data centers in EUDAT with computational resources  IV  C ONCLUSIONS  This section gives the reader some concluding remarks although we are in the early phases of our 221smart data analytics process\222 in the described case studies \226 but that is a process that might be never finished given the ever increasing amounts of big data sets. We are nevertheless able to derive some initial conclusions about structuring the process and thus performing 221big data analytics\222 in a systematic way in the concrete area of 221outlier detection\222  and 221image data classification\222 of scientific datasets Detailed findings that relate to the clever and innovative combinations of technology required for the \221smart data analytics\222 described in this paper are actively contributed and discussed as part of the Big Data Analytics \(BDA 19 in terest g r o u p of th e Research Data Allian ce \(RDA This enables the guidan ce of non-experts for 221big data analytics\222 and sharing of findings with the broader community \(e.g. with members of the US NIST big data activities We firstly conclude that the general reference model design of a CDI offers \221added value services\222 \(e.g. data sharing, replication, access optimization, data transfers the 221smart data analytics process\222 It offers a solid foundation to perform 221higher level analytics\222 based on concrete algorithms and tools without the need to tackle simple problems such as deploying data transfer protocols We observe that services like B2SHARE represent an important element in a seamless cooperation between general data analytics experts and scientific domainspecific experts for rather temporary scientific data results whereby only a fraction qualifies for long-term data preservation \(e.g. using the B2SAFE EUDAT data service Secondly we are able to conclude that the CRISP-DM is well suited as a backbone for a process we referred to as 221smart data analytics\222 although being originally designed for traditional data mining and knowledge discovery Tailoring this model by describing large-scale compute and storage resources, clarif ying the concrete machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques, tools, and service deployments make the approach feasible to guide the 221high productivity data processing\222 of large quantities of scientific data. These findings are considered to be part of a report compiled by the RDA BDA group Thirdly, we can conclude that the architectural setup of the method for automatic outlier detection is plausible however, we also have to acknowledge that the work on tailoring the algorithm to the specific problem at hand requires many \(parameter\nfigurations \(e.g. within the HPC system UNICORE\Nevertheless, we identified all the required elements and implementations in order to use the method in practice today. Tailoring the CRISP-DM process model, when performing outlier detection, is very useful too, because of many reasons one of which is the clarity of describing all relevant aspects of the concrete proposed method \(resources, data, algorithms, tools, etc This clarity is an important fact during the communication of the general data analytics expert and the PANGAEA scientists. Using an easy and open approach for sharing the data for validation purposes by using the B2SHARE EUDAT data service was generally viewed as an important element of the method We can further conclude that the architectural setup of using parallel SVMs for classification of multi-spectral image data is possible to implement today. Nevertheless the parameter tuning and creating the classifiers is not straightforward and needs time to achieve reasonable results. These findings are important, but further raise the demand for several software p ackages that need to be maintained and installed on relevant underlying hardware resources \(i.e. Twister and libSVM\. Hence, achieving a speed-up required for \221big data\222 is possible, but also requires a distributed system e.g. with map-reduce Using CRISP-DM and the B2SHARE EUDAT data service was equally useful in this case study as described in the concluding remarks of the previous case study  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work is partially funded by the EUDAT project that is co-funded by the EC 7 th Framework Programme Grant Agreement no: 283304\.
