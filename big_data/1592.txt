SUMMARY/CONCLUSION 5 \nREFERENCES ......................................................... 6 \n n1. INTRODUCTION \nThe LCRD mission is a Principal Investigator led project \nfunded by the NASA Office of Chief Technologist \(OCT SCaN that laser \ncommunications can meet the ever-increasing need to \nimplement high rate communications using low power, low \nmass laser communications systems on board future \nspacecraft. The LCRD mission will develop and deliver on-\norbit all of the critical hardware and software technologies \nthat will be needed to support a communications \narchitecture required by future space missions that are \nexpected to transmit and receive very high data rates and \nvery large volumes of earth- and space-science data.  A key \naspect of this future communications architecture will be the \nability to relay data from one spacecraft to another via wide nbandwidth optical links. The technologies that need to be \ndemonstrated include, but are not necessarily limited to, the \nfollowing: optical components and electronics used to \nimplement an integrated DPSK/PPM modem, optical \nsystem pointing and tracking, and networking protocols.  \nThe LCRD project will use mature proven, existing systems \nwhenever possible, and it will leverage existing flight \nsystem technologies by implementing modifications and \nenhancements as needed to fully characterize high data rate \nlaser communications in a space flight environment. LCRD \nwill provide two years of continuous high data rate laser ncommunications in an operational environment.  \nThe high data rates possible over optical links are expected nto reduce life-cycle costs for mission operations and \ninfrastructure by enabling large data volumes to be directly \ndownlinked to fewer, more accessible locations, in contrast \nto the current RF based space and ground communications \nnetwork.  The dual optical link system also enables LCRD \nto become the first step in demonstrating laser \ncommunications for the next generation Tracking and Data \nRelay Satellite \(TDRS has the potential to provide \nearly operational support for proposed International Space \nStation \(ISS other low Earth orbit \(LEO infusion into Deep Space and Near Earth \noperational systems, while growing the capabilities of \nindustry sources. \nThe LCRD mission architecture also has the potential to \ndemonstrate the space-based networking relay operations.  \nThe demodulation and remodulation within the flight \npayload allow for the onboard operation of higher layer \nprotocols, such as the Delay Tolerant Networking \(DTN with systems within the LCRD \nground segment, a full instantiation of a space \ninternetworking service provider can be demonstrated. \nLCRD is comprised of space and ground based elements as \nillustrated in Figure 1.

LASER COMMUNICATIONS  \nLCRD provides two years of continuous high data rate laser \ncommunications in an operational environment. High-rate \ncommunications will revolutionize science and exploration. \nLaser communications has the potential to provide for data \nrates 10-100 times more 


capable than current RF systems, \nallowing new kinds of connectivity paradigms and enabling \na new generation of remote scientific and planetary \ninvestigations. Laser communications will enable missions \nto use bandwidth-hungry instruments, such as hyperspectral \nimagers, synthetic aperture radar \(SAR nwith high definition in spectral, spatial, or temporal modes. \nLaser communications will make it possible to establish a \n“virtual presence” at a remote planet or other solar system \nbody, enabling high-rate communications with future \nexplorers. \nLCRD with utilize an Integrated Modem that provides for \nboth Differential Phase Shift Keying \(DPSK PPM nThe modulation type utilized for each experiment will be \nbased on required performance characteristics and napplicability to support specific mission scenarios being \nsimulated. The Integrated Modem modulates the input \nelectrical data into an optical signal for transmission and \ndemodulates a received optical signal into output electrical \ndata. The modulation, waveforms and physical layer \nframing used on the optical signals are designed to enable \nhigh-sensitivity, adjustable data-rate, bi-directional optical \ncommunication over a fading, free-space communication \nchannel. \nThe first modulation type, Pulse Position Modulation \(PPM highly efficient and the modulation of choice for Deep \nSpace communications or constrained \(very low npower/mass systems on-off \nkeying approach to map data bits into slots within a frame \nand this technique offers greater efficiency for high peak to \naverage power ratio operations required for power \nconstrained links.  This is due to the resulting operation of \nthe optical amplifier at a lower duty cycle.  The use of PPM \nalong with photon counting techniques in the detector \nincreases the receive system’s sensitivity and enables \nenhanced communications performance for deep space \nmissions. However, LCRD only has a photon counting \ndetector in one of the ground stations due to budget \nconstraints.  The ultimate data rate is limited based on \ndetector limitations and the requirement for faster \nelectronics due to internal clock rates needed to support \nhigher data rates. This modulation type is limited to \nmaximum User data rates up to 311 Mbps for LCRD.  User \ndata are defined as data available for network users and \nexclude overhead related to frame headers, coding and ninterleaving. \nThe flight payload can support communications when the \nsun is in the field of view \(FOV This solar advantage is \nderived from both coupling into a single mode fiber \(spatial \nmode selectivity from optical filtering \(spectral \nselectivity both received PPM and DPSK will be coupled \ninto single mode fiber and spectrally filtered.  This provides \na solar advantage if it is necessary to point near the limb of \nthe earth with the sun behind or when staring near bright \nsolar scatter/reflections. \nThe basic laser communications concept of operations \nassumes there is a specific amount of data at the source that \nmust be transferred to the destination in a specific amount of \ntime — not unlike a typical RF scenario. The high-level \nprocess assumes a scheduled approach where the ncommunications process starts at a specific time, with a link \nestablishment process between the source spacecraft and the \ndestination \(ground station or relay satellite data is transferred during the \nspecified time and then the link is terminated according to \nplan.  If link establishment is not successful or the link \ncannot be maintained for the required duration, due to \nclouds or other link impairment, then an alternative process \nis required.  At a minimum, the data not transferred must be \nstored until it can be transferred later \(to another ground \nstation or relay consideration in link establishment is whether a \nline of sight between the source and destination exists nGeometric line of sight is calculated based upon the source \nspacecraft trajectory, location of the ground station\(s communications through Earth’s \natmosphere is nearly impossible in the presence of most \ntypes of clouds Typical clouds have deep optical fades and \ntherefore it is not feasible to include enough margin in the \nlink budget to prevent a link outage. Thus a key parameter \nwhen analyzing free space laser communications through nthe atmosphere is the probability of a cloud-free line of sight \n\(CFLOS technique \nensuring a high likelihood of a CFLOS between the source \nand destination is needed to maximize the transfer of data \n 2 \n \nand overall availability of the network. Such mitigation \ntechniques include: \n• Using several laser communications terminals on \nthe relay spacecraft, each with its own dedicated \nground station to simultaneously transmit the same \ndata to multiple locations on Earth; hopefully one \nwill be free of clouds to allow the transmission to \nsucceed.  Unfortunately, this mitigation technique \ncan be cost prohibitive. \n• A single laser communications terminal in space \ncan utilize multiple ground stations that are ngeographically diverse, such that there is a high \nprobability of CFLOS to a ground station from the nspacecraft at any given point in time. \n• Storing data until communications with a ground \nstation can be initiated.  Of course a key issue is \nmaking sure all of the stored onboard data can be \ntransmitted within 


the allocated time. \n• Having a dual RF / laser communications systems \nonboard the spacecraft.  The RF system could \nsupport low data rate low latency communications \nwhile the laser communications could support high ndata rate communications of data that can be stored \nfor some time \nNASA has studied various concepts and architecture for a \nfuture laser communications network.  The analysis \nindicates ground segment solutions are possible for all \nscenarios, but usually require multiple, geographically \ndiverse ground stations in view of the spacecraft.  Thus laser \ncommunications handover strategies will have to be \ndeveloped.  Those strategies may be different depending \nupon the transmission time required; e.g. handover \nstrategies that work with a laser communications terminal in \nLow Earth Orbit may not work for a laser communications \nterminal located at Mars. \nThe availability of a communication link between a \nspacecraft and a ground station network depends on many \nfactors, including the number and location of the sites in the \nnetwork and the orbit of the spacecraft which together \ndetermine the elevation angle of the link and the path length \nof transmission through the atmosphere.  In our concept, a \nground station is considered “available” for communication \nwhen it has a CFLOS at an elevation angle to the spacecraft \nterminal of approximately 20° or more. The network is n“available” for communication when at least one of its sites \nis “available.”  Typical meteorological patterns cause the \ncloud cover at stations within a few hundred kilometers of \neach other to be correlated Consequently, stations within \nthe network should be placed far enough apart to minimize \nthese correlations thus maximizing the probability of \nCFLOS. This requirement may lead to the selection of a \nstation that has a lower CFLOS than sites not selected, but is \nless correlated with other network sites.  The stations also nneed to be close enough to each other to maintain \ncontinuous access with the spacecraft as its position with nrespect to the ground changes with time. \nDepending on the scenario, free space laser communications noperations can take advantage of cloud prediction at each \nground site to maintain CFLOS, and thus maximize navailability. Maintenance of CFLOS can be accomplished \nby knowing whether the line of sight to each ground site is \ncloud free at a given time, and knowing how many minutes \ninto the future each site is expected to remain cloud free. \nHaving local weather and atmospheric instrumentation at \neach site and making a simple cloud forecast can \nsignificantly reduce the amount of time the space laser \ncommunications terminal requires to re-point and acquire \nwith a new ground station.  Useful instrumentation includes: \n• Weather: Weather information is gathered locally \nby standard meteorological packages that monitor \ntemperature, humidity barometric pressure, and \nwind speed and direction. \n• Clouds: A thermal infrared cloud camera is used to nmonitor the extent of cloud coverage.  These \nsensors indicate not only whether there are clouds \nor no clouds at very high temporal resolution, but \nalso the sky temperature and emission. \n• Daytime Sky Radiance A sun photometer provides \nthis measurement. \n• Atmospheric Loss: During the day, a sun \nphotometer is also used to measure atmospheric \nloss.  At night, a calibrated photometric system that \ntracks stars of stable emission, e.g., Polaris, can be \nused. \n• Clear Air Optical Turbulence: A Differential Image \nMotion Monitor DIMM during the day, the Sun. \nIn addition to outages or blockages due to weather, a laser \ncommunications link also has to be safe. Besides needing to \nbe safe for humans, some satellites have sensitive detectors \nthat can be damaged by intense light sources originating \nfrom Earth. Safe laser beam propagation to near-Earth and ndeep space spacecraft starts at the transmitter, extends \nthrough navigable air space and the near-Earth region, and \neventually into deep space. In the United States, regions of \nconcern for safe beam propagation are under the purview of \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n\(OSHA Administration \(FAA LCH generally \ncoordinates its outdoor laser activities with the Laser \nClearinghouse, a Department of Defense component within \nthe United States Strategic Command.  The ANSI standard \nfor outdoor laser propagation \(ANSI Z136.6 Clearinghouse. \nThe Laser Clearinghouse provides predictive avoidance \nanalysis and deconfliction with US allies, and other space \noperations due to the potential to affect satellites or humans \nin space.  The Laser Clearinghouse can determine whether a \nlaser has the potential for interference or damage to \nparticular satellites.  Lasers with very high peak powers and \nvery small beam divergences \(10 microradians or less nprobably have the greatest potential for producing damage \nto these very expensive systems in space.  Rather than give \ndetailed guidance on the levels that could produce damage \nto satellites, criteria are provided as a starting place where \ncoordination with the Laser Clearinghouse is desirable. \nLasers that can produce an instantaneous irradiance \nexceeding 1 mW cm-2 at an elevation of 60,000 feet \(18 \nkm should contact the Laser \nClearinghouse.  Based on the laser propagation details, the \nLaser Clearinghouse can either issue a blanket approval of \ntransmission at a facility or require coordination of all laser \nbeam 


propagation activity.   \nThus a laser safety system and operational procedures have \nto be in place to ensure safe operations.  Those procedures \nmay lead to periodic outages of the link just as if a cloud \nhad blocked a station. \nAs laser communication links through the atmosphere will \nbe intermittently interrupted, the use of data return \nacknowledgement and retransmission protocols, such as \nDelay Tolerant Networking \(DTN improve the data \nthroughput and completeness. Such protocols cope with \natmospheric disturbances to the laser communications link \nand additionally prevent the loss of data during the \nredirection of the downlink to a second ground station if the \nfirst should be obscured by clouds. Data acknowledgment \nrequires sending information back to the spacecraft either \nthrough an optical uplink, or alternatively through an RF \nuplink Since the data rates on optical communication links \nwill typically be higher than those of RF links, research nshould be conducted on the best data return \nacknowledgement and retransmission protocols for use with noptical links. \nAdaptive optics \(AO by reducing \nwavefront distortion effects.  These include atmospheric \nperturbations due to turbulence. The adaptive optics \ncompensates for optical aberrations caused by atmospheric \nturbulence along the propagation path. AO has been \ncommonly used since the 1990's in astronomy and more \nrecently in laser communication systems to mitigate \nwavefront distortion effects.  The LCRD system will also \noperate at a higher bandwidth and lower elevation angles \nthan existing systems. \n3. DTN/NETWORKING \nThe onboard processing in the LCRD payload differs from \nthe current TDRS “bent-pipe” system, enabling new relay \nservices. The LCRD architecture allows the project to serve \nas a testbed for the development and demonstration of \nnetwork layer relay services.  These developments and \ndemonstrations will apply to optical, non-optical, and hybrid \nfuture communication systems. \nThe first challenge for providing the higher layer data \nservices is the inclusion of onboard data processing.  The \nonboard system must be able to perform demodulation, \ndecoding de-interleaving, and link layer frame processing, \nin order to perform functions based on the payload data nstream and structures.  This processing requires high speed \nhardware designs since it must happen at the received \nsymbol and frame rates.  The maximum rates that can be \nsupported by these onboard processes have typically been \nthe limiting factor for the maximum data rates available for \nhigher layer services.  The complementary functions must \nalso be performed in the transmit direction, however those \nfunctions are generally less complex and less constraining.  \nThe LCRD requirements for this capability are for data rates nup to 300 Mbps. \nThe higher layer services to be provided by LCRD include \nlink layer and network layer services.  Link layer services \nwill be based on the use of CCSDS AOS frame structures.  \nThe fundamental link layer service provided will be the \ncapability to use virtual channels to separate data streams at \nthe frame level.  This capability will allow onboard \nseparation of different types of data and different user data nstreams. \nNetwork layer services allow the use of routing protocols to \nautomatically forward data onto the next link based on \ninformation within received data stream.  LCRD will \nimplement network layer services based on the DTN Bundle \nProtocol \(BP called bundles routed in a store and forward \nmanner between participating nodes over a heterogeneous \nnetwork.  The use of DTN enables autonomous store and \nforward operations, by providing network layer services and \nstorage at intermediate nodes. \nFor the GEO relay service provider, the addition of \nnetworking and, specifically, DTN allows increase \noperational flexibility and efficiencies with increased \ncomplexity.  Through the use of multiplexing user data \nstreams at a combination of link layer and network layer \nmultiplexing, a single space-to-ground link or trunkline \nbetween the relay spacecraft and Earth can carry all user \ntraffic Scheduled or autonomous routing onboard can \nforward data over the appropriate link to the destination.  \nThe appropriate link can also include a crosslink to another \nGEO relay. \nThrough the use of onboard storage trunkline data can be \ntransferred at rates other than the actual user forward and \n 4 \n \nreturn link data rates.  The trunkline data can even include \ndata for links not currently available, either due to planned \nor unplanned link outages.  These capabilities are especially \ncritical for optical link relays to allow for disruptions in the \noptical space-to-ground link. \nFor the relay provider, however, these capabilities require nadditional relay and ground functionality and increased \noperations complexity.  Onboard storage is required on the \nrelay.  The amount of storage, the speed at which the storage \ncan be accessed, and the number of simultaneous links that \ncan access the storage are all performance parameters that \ncan limit the functionality of the relay system.  LCRD is \ncurrently carrying requirements to support two simultaneous nbi-directional links at up to 1.25 Gbps with ten minutes of \nstorage.  The relay payload must also implement the link \nlayer and network layer protocols.  The complexity of these \nprotocols, combined with the desired data rates, will likely \nrequire a combined hardware and software design.  The \nstorage and protocol support is also required at the relay \nprovider’s ground stations.  A networking management \nsystem must be in place 


as well, that will provide the relay \nprovider with the full insight required to ensure user data \ndelivery and enough control to manage the schedule for all \nlinks and routing updates. \nThe LCRD payload, ground stations and mission operations \ncenter \(MOC DTN techniques during the planned \nexperimental scenarios.  These include published bundle \nprotocol transport protocol, and transfer acknowledgement \nmethods, as well as the flexibility to support some nadditional yet-to-be determined DTN techniques through \nsoftware or firmware changes to the LCRD spacecraft and \nground based systems. \n \nFigure 2 LCRD Design Reference Mission Concept \nA user of the DTN-enabled GEO relay will receive benefits \nbeyond those that are achieved by a bent-pipe relay.  The \nmost significant advantage, in the case of optical space-to-\nground links, is the user is isolated from any issues that \nmight be affecting the trunkline.  A user can continue to \ntransmit data to the relay \(assuming enough relay storage user, the user can free up \nits onboard storage at this point.  In a scenario in which a \nuser is attempting to send data to one or more other users, \nall of the users do not need to have a link simultaneously.  \nThe data is essentially “pre-positioned” onboard the relay \nand the destination users receive the data when they are able \nto connect. \nA reference mission concept for the LCRD mission is \nillustrated in Figure 2. The GEO relay may have multiple \nactive links simultaneously.  The links may be to any \ncombination of user platforms and ground stations.  The \nmultiple ground station links may become active due to \neither pre-determined schedules or may have been \nestablished on relatively short notice due to changing \nweather conditions.  The onboard store and forward \ncapabilities allow for a user-to-relay link to remain active \nindependently of any ground station handover that may be \noccurring.  It may even be possible, through the use of \nrouting individual bundles, to have a user’s data forwarded \nto other users or multiple ground locations – perhaps even \ndirectly to a science archive facility.  As long as there \nremains the storage capacity onboard the relay, the \ndestinations for the user data do not need to be connected \ncontemporaneously with the user.  This allows the \ntransmitting user to maintain its own storage and link \ntransmission times, without consideration of any link \nschedule considerations past its own links to the relay. \nThe same benefits apply in the forward link direction, as \nwell.  User forward link data may be transmitted up to the \nrelay before a user is connected, as long as there is the \navailable trunkline bandwidth and onboard storage.  Pre-\npositioning forward link data in this way provides some \nisolation from any trunkline outages in the forward link ndirection.  In some operational concepts, the forward link \ndata may be for multiple users.  The data can remain \nonboard the GEO relay until each destination becomes \navailable. \nIn order to provide all of this flexibility for users, the relay \nnetwork’s mission operations center must assume the \nresponsibility for the user data flows.  This responsibility \ngoes beyond establishing links based on a schedule.  The \nMOC must now keep an accounting of the user data in \ntransit within the provider system \(onboard the relay or \nwithin a ground station nnetwork must all be managed by the MOC transparently to \nthe users.  The MOC must also be able to provide the nnecessary insight to resolve any lost data issues reported by \nusers.  This increase of networking management complexity \nand responsibility is a significant change from the current \nNASA Space Network operations. \n n4. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION \nThe LCRD mission will provide a prototype for a future \nGEO relay network combining laser communications and \nspace internetworking technologies.  The two years of \n 5 \n \noperations will allow the refinement and demonstrations of \nvarious operations concepts and applications, while also \naddressing the remaining challenges for the implementation \nof a future network It is considered to be a pathfinder for \nNASA putting a laser communications service on the Next \nGeneration Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to be nlaunched sometime next decade. \nREFERENCES  \n  [1] Bernard L.

An Example for Tradeoff of Consistency and Latency\nAssume that there is an online store like Amazon. And it\nhas used RSMs in its sales system.

So it shows that common practical\nRSM systems \(with d = 1 and d = [n/2]+1 aspect of overall system benefit. We should\nconsider more intermediate states in the consistency spectrum.\nVIII. RELATED WORK\nWe have surveyed many replicated state machine tech-\nniques [23-26] and their variants such as [27-29]. Their three\nrepresentative implementations are non-uniform total order\nbroadcast Paxos and uniform total order broadcast. Although\nRSMs has been long studied, in this work we do not want to\ndesign better algorithms but try to quantitatively analyze these\nworks from the aspects of consistency and latency. In addition,\nprior analysis works [24,33] on RSMs confine in the three\nrepresentative implementations of RSMs and their variants,\nand few considers consistency and latency simultaneously.\nOur analysis covers more than the three typical ones and\nquantitatively reveals the tradeoff between consistency 


and\nlatency.\nConsistency, which has been long studied [39], attracts\nmore eyes in recent years. With the consideration of CAP [3]\nand PACELC [4], people develop a lot of consistency models,\nfrom weakest eventual consistency [9], timeline consistency\n[40] to causal consistency [41]. Instead of developing a new\nconsistency model or performance optimization for existing\nmodels, we discuss when and how the inconsistency occurs,\nand further measure its degree with a probabilistic model in\nthe context of RSMs.\nThere are several works [17,18 presenting bounded read\nstaleness from data versions, stale time and staleness proba-\nbility to evaluate the inconsistency of quorum like [15], anti-\nentropy [35] systems, where writes are committed by vector\n10\nclocks 16] with semantic reconciliation [5] in causal order as\nopposed to total order of RSMs. In this work, we focus on\nwrite inconsistency for RSMs, since read serializability can be\neasily guaranteed in total order to eliminate read staleness.\nSome previous works have been done on write inconsisten-\ncy. [19,20] provide techniques to make writes satisfying some\nconstraints, which use strong and weak consistency to ensure\nthe constraints are not violated. Write divergency of replicas\nare limited in [21,22]. For example, [21] provides some metrics\nsuch as numerical error and order error for data items, and\nthen presents a variety of algorithms for writes to guarantee\npredefined metrics. These write inconsistency models aim to\nimprove the performance in the absence of crash failures, but\nwe want to know how much inconsistency incurred by crash\nfailures a replication system may encounter, rather than confine\nwrites to some constraints, or bound the maximum deviation\nof a value from its newest version.\nIn the context of RSMs, in this work we quantify write\ninconsistency by the probability of write conflict while con-\nsidering crash failures. Furthermore, we calculate write latency\nand describe how to quantitatively make consistency and\nlatency tradeoff from the aspect of system benefit.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we provide several problems that should be\nnoted or considered in future work.\nA. Quorum Systems\nQuorum systems define sets of replicas W written to and\nR read from, which can be configured such as ONE\(W=1 W = [n/2] + 1 W = n other values. This is very like the three representative\nimplementations of RSMs, but they are essentially different.\nThe reason is that writes of quorum systems are ordered\ncausally and those of RSMs are totally ordered. Thus some\nconditions result in write conflict for RSMs but not for quorum\nsystems. For instance write duplication may occur when the\ncoordinator is falsely suspected. In contrast, it is meaningless\nto discuss write conflict for quorum systems because we can\nnot decide the original write and possible duplicated one are\nin the same order or not for the partial orders of writes. In\nthe practical quorum systems at present they mostly view the\nsecond write as a new write.\nHowever, our partial work can be useful for analyzing\nquorum systems. The formula on the expectation of laten-\ncy\(equation \(8 if\nreplacing W to d.\nB. Failure Mode and Failure Detection\nAs discussed in section II, our work is based on the\nassumption of non-Byzantine failures. If we enlarge failure\nmodes to Byzantine ones, our work should be made corre-\nsponding modification. In future work, we will consider this\nextension.\nFor non-Byzantine failures, we have modeled a common\nand popular heartbeat based but not adaptive and fast failure\ndetector Some optimized failure detectors [31,36] use syn-\nchronized clocks or adjust heartbeat intervals adaptively to\nachieve faster failure detection. This means that the expression\nThb2?Thb1 > To?Te in the formula of the probability of false\nsuspicion Pfs = Pr\(Thb2 ? Thb1 > To ? Te detectors.\nC. Coordinator Election and Failure Recovery\nWhile presenting the formula of write duplication, we have\nnoted that coordinator election and failure recovery [32] may\ninfluence its result.\nRSMs run coordinator election and failure recovery after\nsuspicions on coordinators for synchronizing the states of\nboth committed writes and historical records for replicas. This\nsynchronization may enlarge the range of historical records\nperceived by the new coordinator. Thus the historical records\nincurred by writes sent by the suspected coordinator may be\ncaught by the new coordinator during coordinator election and\nfailure recovery. This will avoid the reuse of sequence numbers\nand lower the probability of write duplication. Although we\ncan also provide a formula to measure the impact of coor-\ndinator election and failure recovery on write duplication it\ndepends on the specific processes of them, which can be very\ndifferent.\nD. Independence of Crash Failures and Message Delays\nAlthough we have released some assumptions in the com-\nputation of probability of write conflict and latency, we still\nassume that crash events of different nodes and message\ndelays between replicas are independent. In practice, they do\nnot always hold, since replica nodes and network links in\nmodern data centers usually share physical machines, routers\nand power devices and so on. However, the correlations among\nfailures and delays depend on the specific hardware and\nsoftware implementations. A reasonable solution is to acquire\nthe correlation factors among failures and delays by statistics\nfor established replication systems, and then append them to\nthe probability of crash failures and the message delays for\nmore accurate results.\nX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we are concerned with providing a quan-\ntitative analysis of the 


relationship between consistency and\nlatency. Given that replicated state machines are widely used\nin modeling replication systems and there are several variants\nof RSM implementations, we first propose a generic model\ncalled RSM-d to give a unified description of major replication\nprotocols using RSMs. Second, on the basis of RSM-d, we\nbuild a probabilistic model for write conflicts that is one of the\nkey factors to cause inconsistency, and a probabilistic model\nfor characterizing latency as well. Third, we further define\na payoff model through combining the write conflict model\nand latency model from the perspective of a service provider.\nFinally, with Monte Carlo based simulation, we validate our\npresented results and show the effectiveness of our solution to\nmake tradeoff between consistency and latency to achieve the\nmaximum system benefit.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Richong Zhang and Yu\nTang for their discussions and feedback improved this work.\nThis work was supported partly by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China No. 61103031, No. 61272165 No. 2012AA011203 Author of National Excellent Doctoral\nDissertation of PR China, partly by Beijing Nova Program\nand partly by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon.com.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
