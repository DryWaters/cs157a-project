quickly and accurately from the data ocean is an important question; this gives theorists and practitioners’ new research direction. SJEP simulation algorithm which based on the logis tics information platform can help maker decisions quickly and accurately to achieve the control of the logistics process, with SJEP algorithm system implementation. It can improve the operational efficiency of enterprises and reduce the whole process of logistics costs and increase revenue KeyWords  SJEP; Logistics Information Platform; simulation algorithm  I  I NTRODUCTION  With the maturity of database technology and 
application of universal, the amount of data accumulated with an exponential rate of rapid growth in human being On the 21st century, when the volume of data grow extremely, if there is no effective way to extract useful information and knowledge, people will feel as helpless as to the needle in the haystack on face the ocean of information It is estimated that a large enterprise database data only 7% is well applied. In this way, as opposed to "data glut" and the "information explosion", people also felt that the "information poor" \(Information poor 
Enterprises attach importance to Logistics as a third source of increasing profits, and the enormous data stream based on information logistics network system, so difficult for enterprises make accurate and efficient decision-making based on these data Therefore, how to discover the useful data 002 fresh knowledge and information in order to help decision makers quickly and accurately make decisions from the data ocean, This gives theorists and practitioners new questions SJEP algorithm which based on the logistics information platform can help decision makers quickly 
and accurately decisions to achieve the control of the logistics process   II  C LASSIFICATION OF D ATA M INING A LGORITHMS  Data mining association rules is one of the most active research methodologies in 1993, proposed by Agrawal etc It was originally put forward for the market basket analysis, and its purpose is to discover different commodities trading database, the link between the rules these rules which can be used to guide the business to arrange purchase inventory and shelf design 
Association rule mining problem find the right course of association rules through a user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence level on given a transaction database D. In general, association rule mining problem can be divided into discovered frequent item sets and generate association rules on two issues Frequent item sets are the focus of association rules algorithms in recent years, its research is based on Agrawal who created item sets lattice space theory As for generating association rules in terms of major items in each frequent focus on them, one by one 
matching rules and conduct Confidence 000 min Confidence testing is necessary, so this part of the work is relatively more mature In 1994, Agrawal proposed Apriori association rules algorithm, since then Apriori algorithm served as the classic for association rules algorithm referenced Apriori algorithm idea used a method known as step by step in the iterative search through the growing number of frequent item sets of elements of the project to the gradual completion discovered, that means the k item set for the exploration \(k + l\ set 
First of all, to identify a set of frequent sets of 1, the set denoted in 1 L for 1 L  sets to find frequent collection of 2 L and 2 L used to find 3 L and so continue until it can not find frequent k item sets in K L

 Recycling process created in the first set of k candidate item set is k C and then generated by scanning the database and test the degree of support generated k frequent item sets K L every K L  needed to find to scan a database once again  For the existence of a large number of frequent patterns, long patterns, or the minimum support threshold is small, such Apriori algorithm will spend a large number of overhead to deal with an extraordinary candidate item set Since each generates a candidate item set, we must scan the database to determine its degree of support Therefore, a lot of waiting set of options for the database need to continue to access the database through pattern matching to calculate the degree of support item sets requires a lot of I/O overhead. The above considerations determine the efficiency of Apriori algorithm not too high On the 2000,Ramamo hanarao and Dong bring forward a jump Emerging Patterns \(JEP\ which contains a very important feature of powerful classification ability on analysis of the shortcomings based Apriori algorithm It identifies each data set \(or class\ the unique characteristics revealed in the jumping mode, JEP is defined as an item set, its support for a data set to 0, in another data set for non 0 degree of support a growth rate of 000  By gathering all of the JEP, it can generate strong classification ability. In some large data sets for the classification of the number of JEP is usually large, the naive algorithm is used to tap all of the JEP and calculation of their collective effect is a very time-consuming Therefore, JEP Classifier algorithms mine the border JEP based on an algorithm. In addition, the rep will also help select those who are most expressive of the JEP On Comparison with Classification algorithm published and compared, JEP Classifiers really can achieve higher prediction accuracy  III  SJEP  A LGORITHM THEORY  A  SJEP Classification Algorithm Through the study mention earlier, algorithms are usually continued several hours based on the classification of JEP stages of learning, one of the reasons is that a lot of unnecessary JEP is excavated The SJEP \(that is the most effective jump Emerging Patterns\ is a recently proposed by a special kind of JEP Compared to the existing classification based on JEP using only SJEP classifications used in the establishment of JEP is a small number, it can not only receive the same or higher prediction accuracy, but also completed the learning phase in a very short period of time \(usually several seconds In addition, the average prediction accuracy is also better than the CBA and C4.5 classification algorithms such as Because SJEP is a special JEP, so the algorithm can directly use the existing excavated all of the JEP, and then choose the SJEP  For SJEP features, inspired by the FP growth algorithm, this article uses an efficient algorithm for direct mining SJEP all the items in the training data set of information stored in the expansion of compressed tree structure, and then use models to segment the growth of our mining SJEP  B  SJEP algorithm structure Definition: Assumptions 1 C and 2 C are two different classes of data musters 002 Pre-specified minimum support threshold min-sup> 0 002 From 1 C to 2 C of the most effective jump Emerging Patterns \(SJEP\, recorded as SJEP 1 C  2 C  Set up an item set X meet the following two conditions 002 1 002 sup min  X  supp 0   supp C2 1  002  and X C 002×\002 2 002 any subset of X, does not meet the conditions for 1 Example: The following table simplifies the training data set, it contains two classes 1 C and 2 C See Figure 001\011  Figure 001\011 The training data sets 1 C  2 C  1 001 3 001 4 001 5 1 2 001 5 2 001 3 001 4 001 5 1 001 2 001 3 2 001 3 001 5 1 001 4 4 001 5 In this case a total of 10 JEP, where are\(l, 5\, \(2,4 3,4\ \(2,3,4\ \(3,4,5\, \(l, 3,5\ , \(1,4,5\ \(2,4,5\ and \(l, 3,4 supports Class 1, \(1,2\ support class 2 Suppose the minimum thresholds of support for the l%, according to SJEP definition: \(2,3,4\ \(3,4,5\, \(1,3,5 1,4,5\ \(2,4,5\d \(1,3,4\re not necessary 002 Because 1,5\s \(1,3,5\and \(l, 4,5\ubset 002 2,4\s \(2,3,4\d 2,4,5\ subset, \(3,4\s \(2,3,4\ \(3,4,5\ and \(l, 3,4\ subset 2,4\nd \(3,4\, which is supports Class 1, \(1,2\ort class 2, a total of four SJEP

 Obvious, SJEP contains fewer JEP, and their classification is sufficient It is easy to see from the previous cases, SJEP is a special JEP, at least the training data set covering a number of instances, and contains fewer items \(attributes  IV  A RCHITECTURE OF L OGISTICS I NFORMATION P LATFORM  Logistics Information Platform is the economic region in a certain context, links to logistics clients manufacturing, commercial and wholesale enterprises etc.\, logistics companies \(3PL, transportation, storage etc.\ and logistics-related sectors \(transport, quality inspection, customs, taxation industrial and commercial maritime, banking, etc.\socialization, open, Internet-based public information system The construction of modern logistics information platform is: to achieve highly efficient logistics services through the creation of a unified logistics information platform, breaking departmental separatism and fragmentation and establish a collaborative working mechanism; integration of logistics information platform of existing information resources Logistics Information Platform design requirements are mainly embodied in compatibility, efficiency accuracy, effectiveness, safety and stability, and so on According to the function and organization of different data models on Common information platform information platform should be composed of the following subsystems Data management subsystem: There are two main modules, one is the internal system of data extraction; the other is related to the data on external docking \(e.g., traffic simulation subsystem Intelligent distribution management subsystem: The system is primarily support the vehicle's program scheduling and tracking through the GIS / GPS data organization reference model, the main data is the traffic flow background data Logistics Operation Management Subsystem: This system is support cargo tracking and tracing service mainly through the linear reference model data organization; the main data are cargo tracking information and warehouse management information Online transaction management subsystem: used to support \(transport market trading, warehousing business transactions, etc.\ various types of enterprises in the core functionality of the League of market transactions standardized management, and provide of credit certification functions Comprehensive information dissemination subsystems publishing a number of sharing information, the provision of logistics information to the public services \(such as national trade regulations, international trade information website links, etc\, support the inter-departmental coordination mechanism established; Macro-decision support subsystem: mainly macro-management of government departments in decision-making support services Platform Maintenance Management Subsystem: The main is the routine operation and maintenance management and building security authentication system Specific system architecture are showed in Figure 001\012    V  SJEP ALGORITHM SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION  According to logistics information platform which share information to meet the needs of data sharing organizational model, a variety of different models have different basic operational requirements, the main data query and data manipulation is the performance of public information For Figure 001\012 the five sub-systems, how to efficiently perform data query and the performance of public information through the SJEP-tree structure of data compression and storage of the training focused on all the items of information is the main problem Its structure somewhat similar to the FP-tree structure different is that: \(1\ on count of field, it is instances of the categories need to modify the corresponding count field in SJEP-tree; \(2\ on pointer field, SJEP tree has two pointers namely, horizon link and vertical link. It allows us to traverse from the bottom up SJEP tree, and can easily access SJEP tree items that have the same name of the node On generated SJEP-tree, you need to traversal SJEP tree top-down \(that is, traversing from the root to a leaf node\ scan data set D at the same time, the training data set for each item inserted into the tree; in Mining SJEP traverse SJEP tree only from bottom-up Therefore, SJEP tree do not have bi-directional traversal so, in this algorithm horizon link and vertical link has two purposes: Generated SJEP-tree in the process of The upper data request module called Intelligent Distribution Management Subsystem  Logistics Operation Management Subsystem Online transaction management subsystem Comprehensive information dissemination subsystems Macro-decision suppor t subsystem Platform Maintenance Management Subsystem The lower data request module called Figure 001\012 Information Platform design

 pointing with the left-most child vertical link, Point with horizon link next sibling node; In the SJEP-tree structure it has a good post-construction, Changes vertical link, to point to parents nodes, modify horizon link, to point to the next node in the node in the chain. This approach can save half of the pointer In the excavation SJEP algorithm, Suffix sub-tree is also an important concept, the use of the premise of horizon link and vertical link is from a node in the starting chain of each node, the bottom-up search SJEP-tree through the following steps to achieve Initializes p to point a node in the chain the first node i=1 While \(p<>NULL PST \(a\ranch[i p  v e r t i cal _ l i nk  branch_count1=p->count1 branch_count2=p->count2 PST \(a\base_count1 [i  b ra nc h_ co unt 1   Record in order to \(a\h sub-path of the suffix on the class C1 of the basic frequency count PST \(a\base_count2 [i  b ra nc h_ co unt 2   Record in order to \(a\h sub-path of the suffix on the class C2 of the basic frequency count q=p->vertical_link While \(q<>root  PST \(a\count1 P S T a  count 1  q b ra nc h _ co unt 1   Record PST \(a\s an item name of the node q on the class C1 and the frequency counts PST \(a\count2 [q P S T   a  cou n t 2 [q   branch_count2 Record PST \(a\s an item name, q  q=q->vertical_link  p=p->horizonl_link i Mining the effective SJEP from SJEP-tree, to achieve the Call Mine_SJEP \(T\T recorded as SJEP-tree, the Mine_SJEP process only checks whether each item in JEP. If it is JEP, then it must be a SJEP, do not need to continue to consider any such as a suffix pattern. If it is not a JEP, then generates an order to sub-tree for the suffix, and then even longer pattern completed by the mining process. Process insert_jep \(pattern, SJEP_List mode can inserted pattern into the SJEP_List. SJEP_List formed by the two lists, were recorded from class 1 C to class 2 C and the SJEP from class 2 C to class SJEP 1 C  By construction change pointers finished by SJEP-tree method, saving half of the pointer; it also tap the mode through the introduction of the prefix sub-tree methods it’s not generate the conditions for sub-tree to overcome the FP-growth algorithm in mining mode needs delivery go to generate a large number of shortcomings in terms of sub-tree, which greatly improved the efficiency of spatial and temporal pattern mining VI   C ONCLUSION  The establishment of logistics information platform is the new needs of modern logistics development, this paper proposed the algorithm based on SJEP Logistics Data Association Rules Mining based on the traditional data mining methods, Researched on the Logistics Information System are the perspective of Classification algorithms and this method improved the efficiency of the logistics information platform REFERENCES 1 A g r aw al R e t a l  A M i n i n g asso c i a t i o n r u l e s b e t w ee n se t s o f i t e m s i n  large databases.
