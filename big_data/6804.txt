TideWatch Fingerprinting the Cyclicality of Big Data Workloads Dan Williams  Shuai Zheng  Xiangliang Zhang  Hani Jamjoom   IBM T J Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights NY  King Abdullah University of Science and Technology KAUST Thuwal Saudi Arabia Abstract Intrinsic to big data processing workloads e.g iterative MapReduce Pregel etc are cyclical resource utilization patterns that are highly synchronized across different resource types as well as the workers in a cluster In Infrastructure as a Service settings cloud providers do not exploit this characteristic to better manage VMs because they view VMs as black boxes We present TideWatch  a system that automatically identi  es cyclicality and similarity in running VMs TideWatch predicts period lengths of most VMs in Hadoop workloads within 9 of actual iteration boundaries and successfully classi  es up to 95 of running VMs as participating in the appropriate Hadoop cluster Furthermore we show how TideWatch can be used to improve the timing of VM migrations reducing both migration time and network impact by over 50 when compared to a random approach I I NTRODUCTION Massively parallel data processing workloads such as MapReduce 8 and H adoop 2  are d es i gned f or s cal e The y are commonly deployed on Infrastructure as a Service IaaS clouds as part of a growing trend towards big data By design these workloads are iterative or cyclical in nature A typical Hadoop workload for example consists of a number of VMs In each iteration all VMs 1 executes similar MapReduce operations that process different chunks of the underlying data In cloud deployments however IaaS providers do not typically differentiate between workload s mostly because they treat VMs as black boxes In this paper we focus on the following two questions 1 how cyclical are Hadoop workloads and 2 how can cyclicality be ef  ciently detected and exploited by a cloud provider without a priori knowledge about the running workload There is a number of studies that have looked at VM workload characterization and pl acement 21 30    27  34   35  t o n am e a fe w  Un lik e p re v i o u s w o rk  w e c lo sely e x am in e the cyclicality of Hadoop workloads from the perspective of a cloud provider We analyze three popular data mining operators k-means Dirichlet Process Clustering and PageRank on a local Hadoop testbed and on Amazon EC2 We con  rm that Hadoop workloads are cyclical across CPU memory and network In particular slave VMs experience periods of heavy I/O to read write or shuf  e the data followed by high CPU utilization to process the data More importantly cyclicality within the same Hadoop cluster is highly synchronized across all resources and across VMs in the same cluster 1 In reality a master VM is used for coordinating the execution of slave VMs We present TideWatch  a system that enables a cloud provider to automatically  ngerprints the cyclicality and similarity within VMs without a priori knowledge about the workload inside the VM TideWatch monitors resource utilization then detects the cyclicality of each VM in real time by converting the utilization data into a square wave—from which period length is computed TideWatch also identi  es groups of VMs that are part of the same workload using dynamic time warping DTW 6 to co m p u t e s im ilarity b e tween VM resource utilization patterns and density-based clustering with noise DBSCAN 11 t o group t h em TideWatch can be applied to optimize VM management techniques including schedulin g and placement In particular by detecting the valleys within a workload cycle TideWatch can minimize the amount of writable working set memory that needs to be transferred between physical hosts We have deployed TideWatch at the hypervisor-level of a local testbed and have also used TideWatch to analyze data from Hadoop deployments on Amazon EC2 TideWatch predicts period lengths of most VMs in Hadoop workloads within 9 of actual iteration boundaries and s uccessfully classi  es up to 95 of running VMs as participating in the appropriate Hadoop cluster When applied to live VM migration TideWatch reduced migration time by 53 and reduced network cost by 52 when compared to a random approach TideWatch also enabled more predictable migration costs standard deviation is reduced by a factor of 15 In this paper we make the following contributions 1 we con  rm the existence of resource utilization cyclicality in iterative Hadoop workloads 2 we present mechanisms to automatically detect the exi stence and period length of resource utilization cycles in VMs 3 we describe techniques to automatically group VMs operating on similar workloads and 4 we show how cycles and VM groups can be applied to optimize VM management All o f the above is achieved while treating VMs as a black boxes The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II describes the experimental setup Section III examines cyclicality in Hadoop data mining algorithms Section IV presents TideWatch and how it detects cyclicality estimates period lengths and identi  es Hadoop clusters Section V discusses applications of TideWatch to optimize VM management

F O R O PTIMIZING VM M ANAGEMENT In this section we describe how a cloud provider can use the output of TideWatch to optimize the live migration and placement of VMs A Live VM Migration Live VM migration is a VM management feature that is available on all major virtualization platforms 7 2 2    2 0  It enables a running VM to be moved to another physical machine with virtually no downtime for reasons of maintenance  or bal a nci n g l oad acros s phys i cal machi n es 35   33  While live VM migration has little impact on the performance of the migrating VMs it is an operation that generates a large amount of traf  c on the cloud provider’s network A migration operation can also be slow to take effect due to   Fig 8 Effects of memory working set on migration cost long total migration time which limits its applicability for load balancing 33 The hypervi s or e x ecut e s l i v e V M m i g rat i o n b y transmitting the memory pages allocated to the migrating VM across the network while the VM is still running Importantly the hypervisor tracks which pages have been modi  ed since they were transmitted and retransmits those pages This process proceeds in iterations until the set of modi  ed pages are small enough for the VM to be suspended at the source and resumed at the target The amount of network traf  c generated and total migration time of a live migration operation are a function of the amount of memory allocated to the VM and the rate at which the VM modi  es dirties pages Figure 8 shows how the cyclicality of memory utilization speci  cally the writable working set described in Section II exposed by TideWatch can be used to schedule migration operations When the writable working set is minimal  t 2 in Figure 8 less memory must be transferred resulting in a reduction in network traf  cand migration duration B VM Placement The cloud provider can select where in a data center each VM is placed It has the  exibility to use VM placement to optimize a number of aspects of the data center including overall utilization utilization of a speci  c shared resource like the network or the performance of VMs 35 19    36  In this subsection we discuss how the information exposed by TideWatch complements or in forms placement strategies The cyclical resource utilization behavior of VMs identi  ed by TideWatch can be used to predict utilization and reduce overprovisioning Overprovisioning is a common technique used by cloud providers in which VMs are allotted more resources than they actually need just in case a resource utilization spike occurs By recording the peak CPU or network utilization value in previous cycles a cloud provider can improve hotspot prediction for any placement strategy e.g 35   33  TideWatch

VMs while minimizing the number of VM migrations to achieve the pl acement objective Predictable cyclicality implies that VMs can be packed to fully utilize physical resources without needing to constantly adjust VM placement with migration operations VIII C ONCLUSION We present TideWatch a system that enables a cloud provider to monitor and predict the cyclicality of cloud workloads while maintaining a black-box approach The output of TideWatch in particular the period duration and grouping of VMs can be exploited to optimize VM management in a number of dimensions To date we have applied TideWatch to the scheduling of live VM migration operations with promising results TideWatch enables up to a 53 reduction in migration time and up to 52 reduction in network cost—with signi  cantly lower variation—when compared to a random approach As TideWatch is app lied to optimize an increasing set of VM management tasks we expect cloud providers to be able to increase the quality of their service and lower their costs without requiring explicit cooperation from cloud users R EFERENCES   A m azon W eb S e rvices   http://a w s  a m azon com  ec2   Hadoop MapReduce P rogram m i ng
