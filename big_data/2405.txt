As well as being repeatable\nand optimizable pipelines that bring together datasets and\nanalysis tools, work?ows make-up an important part of the\nprovenance of data generated from their execution. By faithfully\ncapturing all stages in the analysis, work?ows play a critical\npart in building up the audit-trail a.k.a. provenance essential for reporting results, reporting\nthe method followed, and adapting to changes in the datasets or\ntools. These functions, however, are hampered by the complexity\nof work?ows and consequently the complexity of data-trails\ngenerated from their instrumented execution. In this paper we\npropose the generation of work?ow description summaries in\norder to tackle work?ow complexity. We elaborate reduction\nprimitives for summarizing work?ows, and show how prim-\nitives, as building blocks, can be used in conjunction with\nsemantic work?ow annotations to encode different summariza-\ntion strategies. We report on the effectiveness of the method\nthrough experimental evaluation using real-world work?ows\nfrom the Taverna system.\nKeywords-Scienti?c Work?ow; Annotation; Rule-Based Sum-\nmarization; Motif\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn this age of data-intensive science we’re witnessing\nthe unprecedented generation and sharing of large scienti?c\ndatasets, where the pace of data generation has far surpassed\nthe pace of conducting analysis over the data. Scienti?c\nWork?ows [6] are a recent but very popular method for\ntask automation and resource integration. Using work?ows,\nscientists are able to systematically weave datasets and\nanalytical tools into pipelines, represented as networks of\ndata processing operations connected with data?ow links.\n\(Figure 1 illustrates a work?ow from genomics, which from\na given set of gene ids, retrieves corresponding enzyme\nids and ?nds the biological pathways involving them, then\nfor each pathway retrieves its diagram with a designated\ncoloring scheme automation pipelines, work?ows are of\nparamount importance for the provenance of data generated\nfrom their execution [6]. Provenance refers to data’s deriva-\ntion history starting from the original sources, namely its\nlineage. By explicitly outlining the analysis process, work-\n?ow descriptions make-up a prospective part of provenance.\nThe instrumented execution of the work?ow generates a\nveracious and elaborate data lineage trail outlining the\nderivation relations among resultant, intermediary and initial\ndata artifacts, which makes up the retrospective part of\nprovenance. The systematic work?ow-based organization of\nanalysis steps and the faithful collection of provenance is\nimportant for activities such as 1 expected to report on the methods they followed and\ntheir resultant datasets and the base/origin data they used in\nacademic papers describing ?ndings. 2 analysis process\nand data dependencies, scientists could inquire on the impact\nthat a change of a particular input or tool will have on results\nand which parts of the experiment would need to be re-run.\nThese potential ways of exploitation, however, are hampered\nby the complexity of Scienti?c Work?ows.\nWork?ows are typically complex artifacts containing sev-\neral processing steps and data?ow links. Complexity is\ncharacterized by the environment in which work?ows op-\nerate. Work?ows that collate datasets and tools from 3rd-\nparty autonomous providers contain several adapter steps\nfor handling format and protocol heterogeneities [9][8].\nMeanwhile work?ows that perform analytics over local\(ized organization\nand pre-processing of data. We have shown in a previous\nstudy [8] that these mundane operations account for up\nto 60% of the steps that compose work?ows. These steps\ndealing with the technical detail of resource access or data\norganization obfuscate the scienti?cally signi?cant/critical\noperations of the work?ow. Obfuscation degrades reporta-\nbility of the scienti?c intent embedded in the work?ow.\nComplex work?ows combined with the faithful collection\nof execution provenance for each step results in even more\ncomplex provenance traces containing long data trails, that\noverwhelm users who explore or query them 3], [1].\nLack of effective simpli?cation solutions have led sci-\nentists to devise their own ways to cope with complexity.\nThese manual abstraction solutions have the disadvantage\nof being hard-coded into the work?ow design and may not\n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.49\n318\n\b\t\n\n\f\b\f b\t\f\n\n\f\t\n\n\f\b\f\n\n\b\t\n\nFigure 1: A Sample work?ow from the Genomics Domain.\nsimultaneously cater for different aspects of complexity, as\nwe shall analyze in this paper. A handful of researchers\nhave proposed solutions to abstract work?ows using user-\nde?ned views [3], or user-controlled manual redaction of\nprovenance [4], [7]. These solutions expect the user to\nmanually designate signi?cant steps or directly control the\nediting process. Moreover, none of them take into account\nthe nature of data-processing performed 


by the steps in the\nwork?ow, e.g., whether it is utility operation or whether it\nperforms a scienti?cally signi?cant function.\nIn this paper we propose the generation of work?ow\ndescription summaries to tackle complexity in experiment\nreporting scenarios. Our approach has the following charac-\nteristics and contributions: We focus on data-driven work-\n?ows, which is the paradigm supported by most scienti?c\nwork?ow systems. We provide a graph based model for\nrepresenting data-?ows. We use graph re-writing as the\nmethod of summarization. We re-write work?ow graphs with\nrules built on 1 data-\noriented function of operations within work?ows, which we\ncall motifs, and 2 primitives\nthat we introduce. Rules associate motifs, and combina-\ntions of thereof, with reduction actions that specify the\nabstraction operation to be performed. Re-write rules capture\nscientist-speci?ed strategies on how summarization should\noccur. Based on observations on work?ows from the largest\npublic repository of work?ows, we elaborate two sample\nstrategies that aim to abstract out “mundane” data adapter\nand organizer steps in work?ows. In order to highlight\nthe characteristic of primitives and asses our approach, we\nconducted an experiment where we summarized 30 real-\nworld scienti?c work?ows. Summarization is done by using\nthe two sample strategies and we compare the results against\nsummaries that are manually generated by the work?ow\ndesigners as the ground truth.\nThe paper is organized as follows: we take a closer look at\ncomplexity and the manual ways of dealing with it in Sec-II.\nWe then introduce scienti?c work?ow motifs in Sec-III-A,\nand the model that we use to formally represent work?ows\nin Sec-III-B. We present the re-write primitives in Sec-IV-B.\nWe detail the two sample summarization strategies in Sec-\nV. We report on the results of the experimental evaluation\nin Sec-VI. We analyze and compare existing works to ours\nin Sec-VII, and conclude the paper in Sec-VIII.\nII. MANUAL WAYS TO DEAL WITH COMPLEXITY\nWe observe that there are two dimensions along which\nwork?ows can be abstracted, 1 work?ow is\ngiven and 2 in-\ntermediary or ?nal generate is to generate\nare pinpointed. Scientists perform work?ow abstractions in\nthe following ways:\n Grouping operations into subwork?ows. Subwork?ows are\na design construct for developing modular work?ows which\nis an established best practice in work?ow development [8].\nThe major driver for sub-work?ows is to create modules of\nsigni?cant or re-usable function within or across work?ows.\nIn practice, however subwork?ows can also be used for\npurposes other than functional modularity. For example, the\nwork?ow illustrated in Figure 1 contains a subwork?ow that\nsimply concatenates two parameters. Such subwork?ows are\ncreated for aesthetic purposes to simplify the design, as\nopposed to abstracting signi?cant functionality.\n• Sinking ports expected to hold signi?cant intermediary\ndata artifacts to work?ow outputs. The links tagged with\nstars in Figure 1 correspond to such sinking activity. We\nrefer to these as “bookmarked data links” in the rest of the\npaper. Bookmarking is done when the user wants to report\nsigni?cant side-products alongside the intended outputs of\nthe work?ow, and encodes this as part of the work?ow\ndesign. Hard-coded bookmarking is a poor practice for\nwork?ow design, as it clutters the output signature of the\nwork?ow Moreover, it creates more complexity process-\nwise while trying to provide abstract data-wise.\n• Using libraries of components engineered to work to-\ngether. Several work?ow systems provide libraries of com-\nponents that have well-de?ned and interoperable-by-design\ninvocation interfaces. By solely using modules from such\nlibraries, compact work?ows with little/no data adapter\noperations can be devised. This approach however, is highly\ndependent on those curated libraries, and as soon as one tries\nto incorporate resources from other contexts or libraries, then\none needs data adaptation and organization.\n319\nIII. A CLOSER LOOK AT SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS\nA. Scienti?c Work?ow Motifs\nAt the heart of our approach lies the exploitation of\ninformation on the data processing nature of activities in\nwork?ows. We propose that this information is provided\nthrough semantic annotations, which we call motifs. We use\na light-weight ontology, which we developed in previous\nwork [8] based on an analysis of 200+ work?ows \(Ac-\ncessible http://purl.org/net/wf-motifs functional\nnature and the Resource-Oriented implementation nature.\nWe refer the reader to [8] for the details here we brie?y\nintroduce some of the motifs in light of our running example.\n• Data-Oriented nature. Certain activities in work?ows,\nsuch as DataRetrieval, Analysis or V isualizations,\nperform the scienti?c heavy lifting in a work?ow. The\ngene annotation pipeline in Figure 1 several retrieval steps \( see\n“get enzymes by gene” , “get genes by enzyme” opera-\ntions steps are pipelined to each other\nthrough use of adapter steps, which are categorized with the\nDataPreparation motif. Augmentation is a sub-category\nof preparation operations. Augmentation decorates data with\nresource/protocol speci?c padding or formatting. \(The sub-\nwork?ow “Work?ow89” in our example is an augmenter\nthat builds up a well formed query request out of given\nparameters 


the inverse of\naugmentation, they extract data from raw results returned\nfrom analyses or retrievals \(e.g SOAP XML messages produce the same data but\nchange its cardinality \(see the “Flatten List” steps in our\nexample general category is DataOrganization\nactivities, which perform querying and organization func-\ntions over data such as, Filtering, Joining and Grouping.\nThe “Remove String Duplicates” method in our example is\nan instance of the ?ltering motif. Another frequent motif is\nDataMoving. In order to make data accessible to external\nanalysis tools data may need to be moved in and out\nof the work?ow execution environment such activities fall\ninto this category \(e.g. upload to web, write to ?le etc operation in our genomics\nwork?ow is an instance of this motif.\n• Resource-Oriented nature, which outlines the implemen-\ntation aspects and re?ects the characteristic of resources that\nunderpin the operation Classi?cations in this category are:\nHuman? Interactions vs entirely Computational steps,\nStatefull vs Stateless Invocations and using Internal\n\(e.g. local scripts, sub-work?ows e.g. web\nservice, or external command line tools are\nrealized by external, stateless resources \(web services realized with\n

Item frequency computation\nA second job is exploited to compute the item frequency\nfrom the transactions emitted by the pre-processing phase.\nAn example is reported in Tables II and III. Table II has\nthree sample transactions that represent a possible output\nof the pre-processing phase. A map function is exploited\nto process each transaction: the map emits a \(key, value item in the transaction, where the key is the\nitem itself \(e.g., RTT=5-10 i.e.,\nalways 1. A reduce function is then executed to sum all the\nvalues for each key, hence computing the support count of\neach item. This is a typical group-by query performed as a\ndistributed MapReduce job. As a running example, we will\nconsider the sample result of this job reported in Table III,\nas obtained by the sample transactions in Table II.\ntransaction 1 RTT=5-10 NumPkt=3-4 Hop=10\ntransaction 2 RTT=5-10 Hop=11\ntransaction 3 RTT=5-10 NumPkt=3-4\ntransaction 3 RTT=5-10 NumPkt=3-4 Hop=11\nTable II\nSAMPLE TRANSACTIONS\nD. Itemset mining\nA third job performs the itemset mining by exploiting\nthe parallel FP-growth algorithm, as described in [12]. This\nstep consists of multiple MapReduce tasks.

Rule extraction\nThe rule extraction step, to the best of the authors knowl-\nedge, is a novel contribution as a distributed cloud-based\nservice. It consists of a MapReduce job, as detailed in the\nfollowing. For each itemset of length k \(k-itemset emits:\n• a \(key,value k ? 1 key,value k ? 1 k-itemset, support count of the k-\nitemset k ? 1 emitted as key contains its k-\nitemset and the k-itemset support count as value, the missing\nitem in the \(k 1 head k ? 1 antecedent \(rule body k ? 1 are\nused to compute the support, con?dence, and lift of the rule,\nas de?ned in Section III. Table V reports the rules extracted\nfrom the itemsets of the running example \(see Table IV nal step is executed by means of a MapReduce job to\nsort and aggregate the rules according to the consequent and\nthe quality measure. As discussed in Section III, we selected\nthe lift as rule quality measure. Sorting and aggregating on\nthe consequent helps in analyzing the extracted rules for\n?nding signi?cant correlations. A sample output based on\nour running example is reported in Table VI.\n1286\nrule sup count sup conf lift\nRTT=5-10 NumPkt=3-4 3 75% 75% 0.75\nNumPkt=3-4 ? RTT=5-10 3 75% 100% 1.33\nRTT=5-10 ?

Then all the\nconcrete services in each service candidate set are sorted in\ndescending order according to their utility. When the mutation\noperation is applied, the replacement process will search\nanother service candidate from the beginning of the service\ncandidate set until the assignment is different from the old\nassignment, and then replace it.\nThe service selection algorithm based on a modi?ed GA\nfor data-intensive service composition is given in Fig. 6.\nV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algo-\nrithm, we veri?ed it against the simulated composite service\nthe functional graph of which is shown in Fig. 3. The loop\nstructure can be unfolded by cloning the vertices involved in\nthe structure as many times as the maximal loop count [14].\nThis paper does not deal with loop relation so the maximal\nloop count is 1.\nA. Test case generation\nThe values of parameters considered in this paper are:\nNpop = 20, MaxIt = 1000, PC = 0.7, PM = 0.1.\nThe weights for QoS attribute cost and response time are 0.8\nand 0.2 respectively. The performance of the modi?ed genetic\nalgorithm is af?liated to the size of the data-intensive service\ncomposition problem. The size of the problem depends on the\nnumber of abstract services in the work?ow and the number of\nconcrete services for each abstract service. Thus, we generate\ntwo test groups. The ?rst test group includes 5 test scenarios\nwith different numbers of service candidates. The number of\nservice candidates for each abstract service ranges from 10\nto 50, in increments of 10. The number of abstract services is\n?xed at 9. The second test group includes 4 test scenarios with\ndifferent numbers of abstract services. The number of abstract\nservices is 15, 20, 25 and 30. This was done by increasing the\nnumber of abstract services on the work?ow of Fig. 3 with\na sequential ?ow structure. The number of service candidates\nfor each abstract service is ?xed at 10. This two test groups\nare designed to test how the running time of the proposed\nInteger array coding\nRandomly create the first generation\naccording to the directed graph\nEvaluate each individual\nApply elitism selection and\ntournament selection\nApply single point crossover operator\nApply mutation operator to each new\nindividual created by crossover operation\nCreate the new generation\ntermination condition\nhas been reached\nNo\nCalculate the utility of each concrete service\nin each service candidate set\nSort and reorganize the generation according to \nthe fitness value of each individual in descending order\nOutput the first individual of the generation\nYes\nFig. 6: Data-intensive service composition selection algorithm\nbased on GA\nalgorithm will change as the number of service candidates and\nthe number of abstract services change.\nAll test scenarios are run twenty times and the average\nvalues are reported. The cost and response time of a service\ncandidate are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution of\nthe interval [1,10]. The access cost and transfer time of each\ndata set are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution of\nthe interval [1,10]. The transfer cost is the price to be paid per\nunit of transfer time and its value is set as 1 in this paper. The\nvalues of the access cost and transfer time of data sets, and\nthe values of the cost and response time of service candidates\nwill not affect the running time or generations of the proposed\nalgorithm. So their values can be in any intervals.\n360\nB. Result analysis\nThe simulation results are shown in Fig. 7 on the next page.\nFig. 7\(a e 7\(f i a i the ?tness value\nof the best individual from the beginning of the trial, and the\nred point denotes the ?tness value of the best individual of\neach generation. The value of ‘GUtility’ is the ?tness value\nof the best individual from the beginning of the trial and it\ndepends on the QoS attributes of services. Different values of\nQoS attributes give different values of ‘GUtility’. That is to\nsay, the change of the value of ‘GUtility has no signi?cance\nfor the simulation results. The value of ‘FRIT’ is the number\nof generations when the best tness value appeared and from\nthis iteration the value of the best ?tness will not change.\nTable I gives the details of the results of the ?rst test\ngroup. According to the value of ‘Average FRIT’ in Table I,\nas the number of concrete services increases from 10 to 50 in\nincrements of 10, the number of generations to create the best\nindividual does not change, which is ?xed at 7.

We present the lifetime\nof data-intensive service composition and model the data-\nintensive service composition problem as a directed graph. We\nalso present the optimization problem of data provider, service\nprovider and service composer in the two-stage negotiation\nprocedure. The proposed genetic algorithm adopts the combi-\nnation of elitism selection and tournament selection, a modi?ed\ncrossover and mutation operations to ?nd the optimal solution.\nFuture extensions of the work will develop a local selection\nrule to improve the performance of the algorithm, and compare\nit with other approaches such as mixed integer programming\nand random selection approaches. Also, the algorithm will be\napplied in a real-life application. This paper tries to apply a\nmodi?ed GA to implement the rst step in the whole process\nas discussed earlier, and the development of the algorithms\nfor the two negotiation processes for data-intensive service\ncomposition are currently under way.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to\nDr. Madeleine Cincotta for her help in the editing of this\nmanuscript.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

have worse \nweak scaling. \n4.5 Generating Large Networks \nOur main goal for designing this algorithm is to generate \nvery large random networks. Using our algorithm with the \nRRP scheme, we are able to generate a network with 50 \nbillion edges, with n = IE and x = 5. Using 768 processors, \nthe generation of this network takes only 123 seconds. \n4.6 Partitioning and Load Balancing \nN ode partitioning has significant effects on load balanc­\ning and performance of the algorithm. In Section 3.5, we \nhave discussed three partitioning schemes UCP, LCP and \nRRP, and theoretically analyzed them. In this section, we \nexperimentally study these schemes and their effect on the \nperformance of the algorithm. In these experiments, we use \nn = 108 nodes, x 10 edges per node, and 160 processors. \n160 processors are sufficient to demonstrate the behavior and ndifferences of the partitioning schemes. For each of the three \nschemes, we measure the computational load in the proces­\nsors by the number of nodes per processor, the number of \noutgoing messages from the processors and the number of \nincoming messages to the processors. The results are shown \nin Figure 7. \n4.6.1 Node Distribution \nThe node distribution is shown in Figure 7\(a uniformly among the pro­\ncessors, and each processor has about 62,500 nodes. For \nLCP, the number of nodes in the processors are increasing \nlinearly with the rank of the processors. \n4.6.2 Message Distribution \nIn a consecutive partitioning \(UCP and LCP and \nreceives incoming messages from processors i + 1 to P - 1 .  \nFor each node, a processor sends a request message with \nprobability at most 1 - p \(see Eqn. 2 a processor is propor­\ntional to the number of nodes in the processor, as shown \nin Figure 7\(b the UCP and LCP schemes, \nprocessor 0 does not need to send any request messages at \nall. \nFigure 7\(c the number of incoming request mes­\nsages for each processor.

Figure 7\( d shows the total load for the three par­\ntitioning schemes. Scheme RRP distributes the load almost \nperfectly among the processors. Load balancing in the LCP \nscheme is also quite good. On the other hand, UCP scheme ndistribute the load very poorly. These experimental results \nverify our theoretical analysis given in Section 3.5. \n5. CONCLUSION \nWe developed a parallel algorithm to generate massive \nscale-free networks using the preferential attachment model. \nWe analyzed the dependency nature of the problem in detail \nthat led to the development of an efficient parallel algorithm \nfor the problem. Various node partitioning schemes and \ntheir effect on the algorithm were discussed as well. Our \nalgorithm produces networks which strictly follow power-law \ndistribution. The linear scalability of our algorithm enables \nus to produce 50 billion edges in just 123 seconds. It will be \ninteresting to develop scalable parallel algorithms for other \nclasses of random networks in the future. \n6. REFERENCES \n[1] R. Albert, H. Jeong, and A.-L. Barabasi.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
