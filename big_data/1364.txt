On the other hand, smartphones are \nruling the day in today’s Post-PC world and are emerging as \nbetter players in offering services to consumers.  Concurrent \nwith the widespread adoption of cloud computing, \nsmartphones have been clubbed with the power of cloud \ncomputing, thus giving rise to a new term called the Mobile \nCloud Computing. With the mobile cloud, users connect to \ntheir applications and data which reside on some remote data \ncenters, instead of on their local mobile devices Users pay \nonly for the connection process and the services they access.  \nThis paper presents the design and implementation of \nconstruction and configuration of cloud infrastructure using \nEucalyptus and KVM, and invoking a cloud service from an \nAndroid phone.  The cloud service used in the case study is a \nVideo on Demand SaaS streaming service which aims at \nplaying a large video onto a mobile phone.   \nKeywords—Cloud Computing; VOD SaaS; Android; \nEucalyptus; KVM; Web Service; SaaS Framework; Mobile \nCloud; SOAP; Mobile Webservice; Mobile SaaS; Axis 2 \nI. INTRODUCTION \nCloud computing is changing the way of the business \nworld towards their IT solutions. From renting IT resources \n\(infrastructure, platforms, software on-demand \nservices, cloud computing has simplified all under its \nterritory. The end-users are need not be bothered to know the \ndetails of a specific technology while hosting their \napplications.  Cloud Service Provider \(CSP   rate that is set by their specific needs and \nthe CSP takes care of all the essential multifaceted \noperations on behalf of the end-user. Cloud provides the \nwhole system that allocates the needed resources for \nexecution of user applications and management of the \ncomplete system flow. Fig. 1 describes the graphical nrepresentation of the architecture of cloud computing. \nAdditionally, this new model has gathered many nexponents because of being branded as a ‘Greener \nComputing Alternative’ [3]. Analysts say that pooling of nresources and facilities can help cut substantial costs for \nbusiness organizations. In addition, cloud also has an \nextremely positive influence on the environment as an \nAT&T supported study posits [4]. By 2020, the group \nestimates, large US companies that use cloud can achieve \nannual energy savings of $12.3 billion and annual carbon \nreductions equivalent to 200 million barrels of oil. \n \n \nFigure 1.  Cloud Computing Architecture. \nOn the other hand, smartphones, tablets and other mobile \ndevices have created a phenomenal revolution in the world \nof communication.  However, smartphones aren’t “smart” \nwithout considering the apps that give their usability and \nadoption globally.  A market research report by World \n2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on Mobile Data Management\n978-0-7695-4973-6/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/MDM.2013.89\n171\nMobile Applications states that, the total global mobile apps \nmarket is expected to be worth $25 billion by 2015 [5].  \nEnterprises are transforming rapidly as “Mobile Enterprises” \nand are enabling their customers to carry out their business \nfunctions through mobile devices bringing real dollar value \nto enterprises.  Phones have clearly evolved from their \nprimary state of only providing call services to providing \nvalue added services such as broadband connectivity, \nlocation aware services, office suite games, and sensors such \nas accelerometer, compass, barometer, etc.  To provision \ncustomer with better services, several newer handhelds are \nbeing released each day with differing configuration and \ncomputing capability.  But yet, smartphones are intrinsically \nlimited by battery lifetime, memory and storage capacity To \nhandle this limitation, mobile devices are backed up with the \npower of cloud computing thus, rendering a new research \narea called the Mobile Cloud Computing.  Mobile cloud \ncomputing enables mobile devices to use cloud services for \ndata processing, storage and other processor-intensive tasks.  \nAccording to ABI research By 2015, more than 240 billion \ncustomers will be leveraging cloud computing services \nthrough mobile devices, driving revenues of $5.2 billion” \n[6]. \nThe convergence of cloud with mobile devices has ndrastically reduced the need for advanced handsets.  It is \nreally exciting to know that a feature phone with limited \nfunctionality and just a browser to access the cloud will \nsuffice to perform any kind of extensive processing task.  \nGartner in fact, estimated that the installed base of \nsmartphones and browser-equipped phones will surpass 1.82 \nbillion units by 2013, and outpace a total of 1.78 billion PC’s \nand also reports from Juniper Research had indicated that the \nmarket for cloud-based mobile applications will grow to \n88 from 2009 to 2014 and will reach $9.5 billion by 2014 \n[7][8].  Many users already have a daily experience of using \ncloud services over mobile devices such as Gmail, Picasa, \nFacebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, etc.  In fact today’s top giant \nin social networking, Facebook, estimates for more than 600 \nmillion mobile users, leading 


to almost 60% of its total user \nbase [9].  Apple iCloud and Amazon Silk Browser are two \nother mobile applications that leverage the cloud.  Apple’s \niCloud stores data such as music, photos, apps, calendars netc. on Apple’s data centers and synchronizes them with all \nthe iOS devices.  Amazon Silk is a “split browser” where \ncertain parts of software reside on the mobile hardware and \nthe remaining on Amazon EC2 depending on the page \ncomplexity and network conditions. \nThe cloud computing stack offers services in the form of \nSaaS \(Software as a Service Platform as a Service Infrastructure as a Service SaaS is concerned \nwith rendering the entire software itself as a service.  The \nactual software is resident on some remote machine and just \nan access to this software is provided for a certain time \nperiod as mentioned in the Service Level Agreement.  PaaS \noffers the development environment to create software napplications.  And IaaS provides the entire infrastructure \nsuch as servers, storage, networks and operating systems \nitself as a service.  A cloud service refers to software \nfunctions exposed as Web Service over the Internet.  Web \nservices have emerged as a set of open standards and are a \nway to expose some business logic over the Internet to other \napplications.  In the emerging computing era, computers are \nmobile, devices are connected, applications are interactive, \nand service delivery needs to be immediate.   \nOver the years, real time video streaming has been the \npromising application used in several sectors such as \nbusiness, education military, media and so on.  The storage \noffered on a mobile device isn’t adequate enough to run a \nvery large high quality video.  This paper explores the design \nand implementation of VOD \(Video on Demand nframework for Android platform on cloud environment. For \nthis experiment, a SaaS model is employed to stream a real \ntime video from a cloud enabled machine to a mobile device.  \nTo realize this, a private cloud infrastructure has been setup \nusing the Eucalyptus and a VOD Web service is deployed in \nit and accessed over an Android phone.  \nII. RELATED WORK  \nVideo retrieval on mobile devices is a challenging and \nemerging research problem. Mobile devices have limited \nluxury in terms of processing power, storage capacity, \ndisplay capability, etc. and therefore impose more challenges \ncompared to viewing the video on a personal computer Due \nto the mobility feature, ensuring network connectivity and \nproviding considerable bandwidth to guarantee uninterrupted \nvideo dissemination is also a great challenge.  There has \nalready been a spur of research activity from academia and \nindustry working on to address these issues.  The work in \n[10] provides platform-independent adaptive approach for \nmobile devices for disruption tolerant end-to-end optimized \nvideo streaming.  The QoS attributes and connection level \nparameters are taken into consideration to provide video nstreaming capabilities with reasonable quality of service on \nall Java enabled phones.  The unprecedented growth of \nWorld Wide Web necessitates the dissemination of \nmultimedia content as Web services.  Lam and Rossiter [11] \nhave proposed SOAP based streaming content delivery \nframework for multimedia Web services The framework \nuses an extension of existing SOAP standards, called the \nSOAP streaming message exchange pattern, which allows \nstreaming content to be transmitted between two SOAP \nnodes over HTTP protocol.  The proposed framework is \ncapable of delivering quality multimedia content to users \nwith heterogeneous configurations and requirements.  Web \nservice access on mobile devices differs from accessing it on \na laptop personal computer.  Mobile devices demand high \nprocessing and memory requirements due to the processing noverhead involved with Web service responses and due to \nthe heterogeneity of the data formats used.  Hence two \nproposals namely Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition \(J2ME WSA Service \n\(SMS  respectively. \nWith the widespread adoption of cloud computing, there \nare shifts in consumer expectations Users expect to \nconsume any kind of online services from mobile devices as \nequivalent to any personal computer.  In paper [13], a \nreference or a base architecture called Open911 has been \n172\npresented for the development of cloud-based applications \nthat feed mobile devices either through native or web \napplications Saranya and Vijayalakshmi [14] have devised \na mechanism to support interactive mobile live video \nlearning system in cloud environment.  The live lectures of \nthe instructors are splitted as chunks and streamed to the ncloud and on video request by the mobile user; the video is \nbroadcasted to the student’s mobile devices by creating a \nbuffer in client’s local memory.  The issues and challenges \nconcerning the inclusion of mobile with cloud computing \nhave been identified and are been investigated.  Bahl, Han, \nLi and Satyanarayanan [15 have highlighted some issues on \ntransitioning from a normal cloud to a mobile cloud \nenvironment.  The resource benefits of the cloud can be \nseamlessly utilized by the mobile devices without incurring \ndelays and jitter, thus empowering mobile users from any \nfundamental constraints.  To handle the resource deficit of nsmartphones, Chun and Maniatis [16] have devised \nCloneCloud architecture by partially offloading the nprocessing from the smartphone to a computational \ninfrastructure hosting a cloud of smartphone clones nDifferent categories of augmented execution such as \nPrimary, Background, Mainline, Hardware and Multiplicity 


nhave been proposed for the purpose of operating in diverse \nenvironments. \nAll the aforementioned approaches have proposed \nmethodologies to address varied issues such as video \nretrieval, the rationale behind bridging the cloud and mobile \nenvironment, and so on.  This paper discusses the elements \nof a designing and implementing a mobile cloud setup, the \nstrengths of invoking a video service from a cloud \nenvironment to a mobile device and the difficulties that we \nfaced during our implementation effort. \nIII. MOBILE CLOUD SYSTEM DESIGN \nWith the improvements in mobile network research, \nmobile devices have become popular clients to consume \nWeb services.  In general, Web service is a Web API for \nother applications mainly used to expose certain behavior by \nmeans of standard interfaces.  It uses two protocols SOAP \nand REST over HTTP to invoke the request and response.  \nThe data formats differ according to protocols such as XML, \nJSON, etc.  A standalone software application can serve only \na fewer clients and is restricted to the system on which it is ndeployed.  When the same application is exposed as a Web \nservice on a cloud environment, it is offered as a service to \nall users on a pay per usage basis.  These days, there is a shift \nfrom server-to-server to server-to-mobile endpoints \ncommunication.  Thus, when a cloud service is invoked from \na mobile device, it depicts a Mobile SaaS environment and \nreflects the multi-tenant architecture.  Fig. 2 below depicts \nthe transition from standalone software to a cloud enabled \nsoftware application by means of Eucalyptus framework and \ninvocation of service through a mobile client.    \n \nFigure 2.  Mobile SaaS Framework. \nIV. CROSS PLATFORM SUPPORT FOR MOBILE APPS \nThere are different kinds of mobile devices in the market \nwith different operating systems such as iOS, Android, \nBlackberry, Windows Phone, Symbian, etc.  In order to \ndevelop apps specific to a mobile device, the developer has \nto use the device specific SDK and its API’s to code apps in nthat platform.  The source programming language used to \ndevelop apps in a specific platform also differs from one \ndevice to another.  This creates a burden on the developer if \nhe has to develop a certain app and target it to multiple \nplatforms.  Hence, there arises a need for “Write once, Run \nanywhere” paradigm.  Thus the introduction of cross-\nplatform mobile application development support relieves \nthe application developers from having to re-implement the \napplication using different SDK’s for different phones.  \nSeveral tools exist in the market to offer such support.  A \nmiddleware is implemented which does the API mapping nfrom one device-specific API’s to another.  As a developer, \nmobile applications need to be developed using a base \nprogramming language and given as input to the cross-\nplatform framework.  The framework performs the necessary \ntranslation and develops independent application for each \nplatform.  A comparison of the cross-platform tools is \npresented below in Table 1.  \nTABLE I.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS \nSeveral deployment tools exist to create and manage an \non-premise cloud.  We have employed Eucalyptus to set up \nthe private cloud to offer Video on Demand service. Nurmi \net al., [17] have outlined the basic principles of the open \nsource IaaS framework EUCALYPTUS and presented the \nhierarchical design of implementing the framework on an \nacademic environment.  The mobile cloud setup has been \n173\nimplemented with Eucalyptus 3.1.2 version on a CentOS nrelease 6.3 64 bit system.  The setup includes a total of four \nsystems: one Cloud Controller \(CLC Cluster Controller \n\(CC NCs Q9950 processor with \na hard disk capacity of 320GB and a RAM capacity of 4GB.  \nThe Node controllers are installed on Blade servers with \nIntel Xeon CPU E5530 operating at 2.40GHZ speed, and a \nhard disk capacity of 500GB and a RAM capability of 32GB.  \nThe hypervisor running on the nodes is the KVM.  The \nnetworking mode followed to connect the node controllers \nwith the CC & CLC is MANAGED-NOVLAN.  A range of \nunused IPs has been allocated as elastic IPs and instances are \nautomatically assigned IPs from this range.  Fig. 3 is the nsnapshot of elastic IPs assigned to two instances. \n \n \nFigure 3.  Allotment of Elastic IPs. \nThe job of the Node Controller is to interact with the \nhypervisor running on the node to know the node’s physical \nresources such as size of the memory, storage capacity, etc. \nand circulate this data to the Cluster Controller. The ncommand “euca-describe-availability-zones verbose” \ndisplays the cluster and its nodes availability at a particular \ninstant.  The free and max columns value indicates the state \nof each VM type on a given availability zone.  The same is \nvisualized in the Fig. 4. \n \n \nFigure 4.  Availability Zones. \nEucalyptus employs public / private keypairs to validate \nthe user identity before logging into the VM instance.  The ncommand “euca-add-keypair” generates two keys where the \npublic key is injected into the instance and the user uses the \nprivate key to SSH into the instance.  Unless a private key is \nheld by the user, the user cannot connect to the instance.  The \noutput of the command “euca-describe-keypairs” is shown \nbelow. \n \n \n 


nThe Eucalyptus Machine Image \(EMI ERI EKI nrepresents an bundled image and is either offered by several \ncloud vendors or a customized image can be created on our \nown with predefined sets of software’s and OS in it.  Walrus \nis a bucket-based storage for storing these images.  An \ninstance of the image is launched, assigned a particular IP \naddress and a connection to the instance is established and \nthe Video Web service is deployed in this instance. Fig. 5 ndisplays two instances launched from a CentOS 5.3 image \nwith Java and Tomcat preinstalled in it.       \n \n nFigure 5.  Eucalyptus Instances Running. \nA Video Web service is ready to deploy on the VM \ninstance in order to receive Video requests from mobile \nclients.    \nA. Video on Demand \(VOD of exposing some business logic \nthrough standard interfaces.  It uses two protocols SOAP and \nREST over HTTP to carry the request and response \nmessages.  The data formats differ according to the protocols \nused such as XML, JSON, etc.  A Video on demand Web \nservice is created as a SOAP service using the Axis2 \n\(Apache eXtensible Interaction System offering various tools to work with Web services.  It \nsupports SOAP with Attachment API for Java \(SAAJ nfeature.  The video on request is sent as an SOAP attachment \nto the end client.  Hence, we have employed the SAAJ \nfeature of Axis2 environment to send the BLOB data, in our \ncase, the video as an SOAP attachment with the SOAP \nenvelope to the client.   \nMessageReceivers are used for client / server \ncommunication in Axis2 environment.  In order to support \nSOAP attachments, RawXMLINOutMessageReceiver is \nused.  This class is embedded within the package \n“org.apache.axis2.receivers” associated with Axis2 kernel.  \nThe service description file “services.xml” holds the \nmessageReceiver details as below.  \n \n \n<service name="VideoService"> \n<parameter name="enableSwA">true</parameter> \n<parameter name="ServiceClass nlocked="false">video.VideoService</parameter> \n<operation name="getVideo n<actionMapping>urn:getVideo</actionMapping> \n<messageReceiver class n"org.apache.axis2.receivers.RawXMLINOutMessageReceiver"/\n> \n</operation> \n</service>\nKEYPAIR mykey nd4:f0:c7:ef:c5:34:d7:77:d0:84:c9:13:9a:b6:15:f8:a6:8b:a8:b1 \n174\nAll service specific parameters are described in the \nservice description file. The parameter “enableSwA” ensures \nthe necessity for SOAP with Attachment for this Video Web \nservice.  The actual service implementation class is described \nwith the ServiceClass parameter.  The actual Web service \nmethod to expose is the getVideo nof operation tag. \nThe video to be sent is stored in a persistent storage \nWalrus offered by the Eucalyptus All instances can have \naccess to this storage.  The Video service specific \ndeployment files are stored in the Elastic Block Volume \nwhich is a storage associated with a specific VM / instance.  \nEven if the VM is shut down and then restarted, the instance \nspecific files are retained as buckets and can be restored nimmediately.        Using the above said configuration, a \nvideo on demand service was created and deployed in a VM \ninstance.  The video service represents a SaaS model and \nensures multi-tenant architecture to depict a scenario where \nmultiple instances of the video can be accessed by several \nclients at the same time.  The following describes the \nprototype SOAP request and response which was used with \nrespect to the above mentioned communication. \nThe SOAP request contains a request for a specific video and \nthe SOAP response contains the video ID of the SOAP \nattachment.  The XMLised BLOB data is encapsulated \nwithin the SOAP envelope and included in the SOAP \nmessage as an attachment.    \n \n \nB. Android Mobile Client \nWith the improvements in mobile network research, \nmobile devices have become popular clients to consume \nWeb services With the number of smartphones count \noverruling the population rate, it is highly evident that every \nperson carries a smartphone and expects to consume services \nfrom his / her handheld device no matter at what time or at \nwhat place.  In this paper, the Video API program was \nsynchronized with an Android mobile phone which served as \na client program to access our deployed services from cloud \nenvironment.  Android is the first complete, free and open \nsource mobile platform developed by the “Open Handset \nAlliance” group for use on cell phones, e-readers, tablet PCs \nand other mobile devices.  Since its introduction, Android \nhas been adopted by several manufacturers such as Samsung, \nHTC, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, etc. \nIn order to invoke an SOAP service, an Android SOAP \nclient program has been written.  An Axis2 SOAP client \nprogram to invoke a Web service involves references to \nseveral client libraries which are in sizes of KBs and MBs.  \nA mobile device cannot tolerate to have client applications \nwith huge sizes due to its limited storage deficiency.  Hence, \na third party library called “ksoap2” is utilized to write light \nweight client programs to invoke SOAP web services.  The \n“ksoap2” library uses its own set of classes to create SOAP \nEnvelope and its associated properties.  Using the Android \nSDK for Windows, an Android app has been developed with \n2.3.3. target and the apk \(application package included internal phone storage of 16GB, \nRAM capacity of 1GB and a 1GHz U8500 Dual Core \nProcessor.  The 


phone ran on an Ice cream Sandwich version \n\(4.0.4 P. \nThe .apk file was ported over Bluetooth to the mobile \ndevice, and the Android Video Client app played the video \nrequested without any delay or jitter problems and occupied \nabsolutely no space on the phone apart from the space \noccupied by the application.  Unlike an native app which \noccupies the phone’s computational resources to play an \nvideo, this Video client app is a Web application which acts \nonly as a user interface to display the video to the client.  \nSOAP Request \n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?> \n<soapenv:Envelope nxmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"> \n<soapenv:Body> \n<video:getVideo xmlns:video="http://video"> \n<video:videoName>Test.wmv</video:videoName> \n</video:getVideo> \n</soapenv:Body n</soapenv:Envelope> \n \nSOAP Response \n<soapenv:Body nxmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"> \n<swa:getVideoResp xmlns:swa="http://video n<swa:video     \nhref="urn:uuid:5236FE1226169060131362913193542" /> \n</swa:getVideoResp> \n</soapenv:Body n175\nThis greatly simplifies the storage problem at the phone and \nis scalable and offers efficient delivery of service to the \nphone.  Both the phone and the private cloud are part of the \nsame WiFi environment and hence, there is no bandwidth \nlimitation problem and the latency problem is also rectified.  \nFig. 6 shows the result of our video on demand SaaS \ndeployment being accessed from an Android Mobile Device. \nVI. CONCLUSION nCloud computing is influencing today’s IT with its \ntechnological competencies and hypnotic business trends nWith the adoption of cloud technologies by the mobile \ndevices, we envision that cloud will definitely facilitate \nmobile devices as the next principal tool to access online \nservices, anywhere and anytime.  This paper has clearly \nshowcased the experimental way of setting up a cloud using \nthe open source platform Eucalyptus.  Eucalyptus has filled \nan important niche in the cloud computing design space and \nhas helped in the deployment of Web services for invocation \nthrough mobile devices.  A Video on Demand streaming \nservice has been deployed to reflect a SaaS model and \ninvoked using an Android phone.  The limitation of running \na large video on a mobile device has been addressed through \nthis model. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Madhan Kumar Srinivasan, K. Sarukesi, Paul Rodrigues, M. \nSaimanoj, P.

This PDP can be \nused later to migrate the application from one PaaS platform to \nanother. \nTOSCA 21] aims to provide a grammar to help the \ndevelopers to describe the PaaS applications through topology \nand orchestration.

process the JSON data into an intermediary\ndata format or do any processing on the message itself.\nMongoDB however must convert the data to BSON, a bi-\nnary based implementation of JSON. This first requires parsing\nthe JSON into Ruby’s native hash structure and from there\nconverting it to BSON data. JSON parsing would be required\nin any application performing this task and so as a real world\ntest, it is fair to include this load during MongoDB’s tests.\nThe YAJL C library is used in these tests which is currently\nconsidered to be one of the most efficient implementations\navailable. The Ruby MongoDB driver is also using the native\nC BSON driver, so the use of Ruby is not unfairly affecting\nthe results.\nHowever to determine whether the performance issues are\nin the JSON library, an additional test was done where the data\nwas converted to a hash only once. This hash was then passed\nto the MongoDB driver. This was repeated for both document\nsizes and get the results in table V and VI for both the 1KB\nand 3KB tests respectively.\nTABLE V. TIME TAKEN TO INSERT 1KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken \(seconds 4.79 19.12\nThroughput \(inserts per second TO INSERT 3KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken seconds inserts per second tests demonstrate that a significant amount of the\ntime is being spent parsing the JSON to a Ruby hash With\nthe 1KB documents, performance increased by approximately\n38.4% and by 52.6% for the 3KB documents. This suggests\nthat as the complexity and size of the document increases,\nthe time required to parse it also increases. However despite\nremoving the JSON parsing from the test, CakeDB remained\n5.4 times faster in the 1KB test and 5.5 times faster in the\n3KB test.\nD. Conclusions\nThe initial tests with both 1KB and 3KB documents\nshowed that CakeDB has better throughput for handling in-\nserts. This is due to its low impact client, streaming inserts\nand latched insert handling on the database itself. The results\ndemonstrate that a specialized database can out perform a\ngeneral purpose database and that CakeDB has significant\nperformance benefits over MongoDB. Additional tests showed\nthat even with pre-hashed datasets and using bulk inserts,\nMongoDB was not able to approach the performance offered\n63\nby CakeDB. This suggests that the performance difference is\nnot simply due to external overhead \(such as JSON parsing in industry there are numerous workloads that do\nnot lend themselves well to a ‘scale out’ approach. This paper\nproposed a disk based approach for storing and then retrieving\nsequential data. By using disk rather than RAM as the main\nform of storage, this approach is able to store significantly\nmore data on a given machine.\nXV. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nCurrently CakeDB only supports simple time range based\nqueries. This works well for reporting, but limits its applica-\nbility to more general use cases. To address this, support is\nbeing added for BSON \(Binary JSON allow for\nricher and more precise queries.\nAlthough CakeDB did not initially focus on read perfor-\nmance, in general usage, read performance was significantly\nbetter than expected. Further research will be undertaken to\ndetermine whether or not such an approach could yield similar\nread performance to current systems \(such as MongoDB Data\nraises questions as to how value can or should be defined.\nIt could be said that the value of data consists of both\nintrinsic and extrinsic value. Further research will be conducted\nto see whether pricing algorithms \(such as those used in\npricing financial derivatives value\nbenchmark.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Kallman, H. Kimura, J. Natkins, A.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
