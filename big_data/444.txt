Extracting Knowledge from Association Relationships to Build Navigational Models Manoli Albert Vicente Pelechano Joan Fons Gonzalo Rojas Oscar Pastor Valencia University of Technology Department of Information Systems and Computation Cami de Vera s/n E-46022 Spain  malbert,pele,jjfons,grojas,opastor  dsic.upv.es Abstract This paper analyzes how the semantics of association lationships in OO conceptual modeling can help to build Navigational Models for b Applications The work has 
been developed in the context of OOWS a Model-Driven Development Method for building b Applications We study some structural and behavioral properties of those conceptual abstractions in order to extract knowledge o e applied in the construction of navigational models From this study a set of design rules has been obtained These rules help the modeler to build navigational models in a systematic way The results of this work have improved the modeling and code generation processes introduced by OOWS 
1 Introduction Currently the most representative web application modeling methods OOHDM W ebML 3 ADM 2 RMM Auto web 5 UWE 8 WSDM 4 EORM 9 etc introduce navigation models to graphically specify navigational requirements of web applications Navigational models are based on structural semantic models as EER or UML Class Diagrams These semantic models provide commonly used abstractions and/or structural relationships association aggregation composition and generalization/specialization taxonomies that are the basic building blocks of the navigational views of a web 
application These s basically de\223ne data operations and links between views that the user can access through navigation Most development methods take structural relationships as simple tools to de\223ne navigation relationships between entities of the system Sometimes this is because the modeling tools semantic models do not have enough expressive power or because the underlying knowledge/information that relationships provide is not used as 1 a methodological guide in order to make easier the construction of navigational models or as 2 a tool to pro 
vide a concrete/precise semantics to navigational relationships induced by structural relationships assuring its consistency with the object model that has been taken as the basis for building navigational models In this context we are interested in extracting as much knowledge as we can from structural relationships in this case from associations aggregations and compositions speci\223ed in a class diagram We use this knowledge for identifying modeling rules and/or recommendations These rules can be used to build navigational models providing modeling guidelines 
that allow speeding up web applications modeling and introducing mechanisms that guarantee the semantic quality of na vig ational models This paper studies how a particular semantic interpretation of UML association aggregation and composition relationships can help to build Navigational Models in a Web Application Modeling Method OOWS A set of structural and behavioral properties de\223ned for these relationships allow us o give a clearly de\223ned semantics to relationships of this kind This semantics help to make navigational dia 
grams richer and to systematize their construction The main contributions of this work are 1 the study and the identi\223cation of the ffects that association aggregation and composition relationships can in\224uence in navigational models construction and 2 the de\223nition of rules as methodological guides for the construction of these models in the S avigational speci\223cation step The paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the OOWS methodological approach which de\223nes a full software evelopment process for the web OOWS provides

200 Temporal Behaviour  It is speci\223ed for each end of the relationship Temporal Behaviour speci\223es whether the objects of the class at the opposite end can be dynamically connected or disconnected creating or destroying a link 1  to one or more objects of the class associated to the end through the association aggregation or composition relationship along its existence The  Static  value speci\223ed over a relationship end indicates that creating or destroying a link during the existence of an object at the opposite end is not possible it is only possible during its creation The  Dynamic  value indicates that it is possible throughout the whole life of the object The values are graphically represented in the class diagram by the UML 001 Dynamic 002 and 001 Static 002 stereotypes at the relationship ends 200 Identity Projection  It is speci\223ed for each end of the relationship Identity Projection speci\223es whether an object projects its identity onto its associated objects When an association-end has the  Projected  value the objects of the class of that end are identi\223ed by their related objects through the corresponding association relationship The  Not Projected  value indicates the contrary The values are graphically represented in the class diagram by the UML 001 Projected 002 and 001 Not Projected 002 stereotypes at the relationship ends We take  Not Projected  as the default value 200 Encapsulation  It is speci\223ed for each end of the relationship Encapsulation speci\223es whether an object can be accessed only through its associated object/s The  Encapsulated  value indicates that the objects of the class associated to the end can be accessed only through their associated object/s at the opposite end The  Not Encapsulated  value speci\223es that the object can be acceded through other objects The values are graphically represented in the class diagram by the UML 001 Encapsulated 002 and 001 Not Encapsulated 002 stereotypes at the relationship ends We take  Not Encapsulated  as the default value 4 Extracting Knowledge from Association Aggregation and Composition Relationships This section discusses the knowledge that can be extracted from the Association Aggregation and Composition Relationships 2  in order to provide modeling guidelines that 1 215association-end\216 in UML it is the endpoint of the relationship 2 We use the term 223association relationship\224 to refer generically to Association Aggregation and Composition help to build Navigational Models This knowledge is obtained by analyzing the structural and behavioral properties of the relationships introduced in the previous section Our objective is to derive a set of rules that allows us to de\223ne a methodological guide that supports the design of the basic interaction units graph nodes of the navigational models and their inter-relationships navigational paths In the OOWS approach these rules affect the de\223nition of navigational classes and relationships in the speci\223cation of navigational contexts In order to extract some knowledge we tackle the following strategy 1 We study how association relationships can in\224uence in the construction of navigational models 2 We analyze the relationship properties introduced in the previous section that introduce additional knowledge to those detected in the previous step 4.1 Association Relationships in Navigational Modeling Association Relationships are the basis to de\223ne navigational relationships in Navigation Contexts This knowledge leads us to the following general rule n n association relationship between two classes  A and B  that exists in a class diagram two avigational classes  A and B 001 view 002 s and a navigational relationship between them should appear in a navigational context This navigational relationship can be classi\223ed in one of these two types Context relationship  which must connect the navigational context to another context whose manager class is the target navigational class of the context relationship This kind of relationship should be chosen when it is necessary to provide additional information of the target class For instance in the navigational context shown in Figure 3 the Researcher manager class is related with the RGroup navigational class by means of a context relationship specifying that the user can navigate o the Groups context to get additional information of a research group Context dependency relationship  which must connect one navigational class  source  to another class  t  in the navigational context This kind of relationship should be chosen when there is enough information in the target class to ful\223ll the information requirements for this context navigation is not necessary in order to provide additional information of the target class For instance Figure 3 shows a context dependency relationship between Researcher and Entity

The disadvantage of this rule-oriented control strategy is that it imposes a restriction on the mixing of forward and backward chaining rules such that a forward chaining rule cannot read any data written by backward chaining rules STO87 To describe this problem let the following be a series of rules Ra to Rd and the resuls REa to REd derived by these rules Ra Rb Rc Rd DB  R  REb  R  REd Also let Ra and Rb be defined as backward chaining rules and Rc and Rd as forward chaining rules If the original database DB is updated rules Rc and Rd though they are forward chaining rules will not be triggered to update the result REd until someone requests the data of REb Thus REd may be iriconsistent with the base data To overcome this problem we use a result-oriented control strategy in which we specify for each result derived subdatabase whether it is to be pre-evaluated or post evaluated The same rule may follow the forward or backward chaining strategy depending on whether the derived subdatabae is to be pre or post-evaluated To illustrate by the example above assume that REd is defined as pre-evaluated and REb is defined as post evaluated Whenever the database DB is updated the rules Ra Rb Rc and Rd will be triggered in the forward chaining fashion to keep REM which is explicitly stored up-to-date REb on the other hand will be evaluated whenever a retrieval operation is issued against it In this case the rules Ra and Rb that derive REb are applied in the backward chaining fashion Thus Ra and Rb follow one control strategy when deriving RFxl and the other control straregy when deriving REb This technique offers more flexibility and alleviates the restriction in POSTGRES described above 7 Conclusion In this paper we have introduced the induced generalization association construct and presented a deductive rule-based language for object-oriented databases The world of subdatabases is closed under this language which facilitates defining inference chains in which each rule derives a new subdatabase based on the subdatabases derived by previous rules in the chain The transitive closure operation can be specified in our language in the form of looping rather than in a recursive form A result-oriented control strategy to be used as the underlying implementation technique has also been introduced in this paper ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Research on the

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
