COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND SEMANTIC DATA VISUALIZATION Sumalatha.M.R, Abishek Ravi, Aravind.M, Prasanna.N Department of Information Technology Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University, Chromepet, Chennai-44 E-mail rsumalatha@yahoo.com   Abstract  In the era of monumental development in all spheres of technology, the repository of huge amounts of raw data is but a necessity. Also with increasing availability of storage space, this factor is not a big problem. Hence instead of tackling issues related to reducing the amount of data to be stored, there is bigger need to implement the creation of a knowledge base and hence create semantic data visualization The work discussed presents an approach to integrate expert knowledge all along the data mining process in a coherent and uniform manner. A collective intelligence system plays a central role in this approach. The work primarily aims at converting the presence of large amounts of raw source data into a knowledge base and collective framework Heterogeneous web sources have been taken into consideration, which act as containers for the raw data source. Data visualization is the second major functionality Taking into consideration the patterns mined, the onus is on the developer to present the mined patterns in a format that is most appealing to the end-user. Creation of such data visualizations requires various dimensions of the pattern to be understood. The estimated end product creates visualization from the knowledge base created from heterogeneous web sources  KEY WORDS  Collective Intelligence, Apriori, Clusters, Semantic Visualization, Ontology  1 INTRODUCTION Collective intelligence is a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals  Knowledge that can be derived from a domain of various voting systems has the capacity for many individual unique perspectives to combine and converge. This convergence can be based on an assumption that the voting systems in use are uninformed. These systems are random to an extent. Knowledge can be obtained by filtering patterns from a decision based process which results in a well informed consensus. Ontology is then framed from this existing knowledge framework and is used as a structure in artificial   intelligence functions. Semantic data visualization and collective intelligence form the heart of the project A Collective Intelligence Information System consists of Instances Instances are the basic, "ground level" components of the system. Strictly speaking, the system need not include any instances, but one of the general purposes of ontology is to provide a means of classifying individuals, even if those individuals are not explicitly part of the ontology  Classes Ontology varies on whether classes can contain other classes, whether a class can belong to itself, or whether there is a universal class  Properties Objects in the ontology can be described by assigning values to their properties. Each property has at least a name and a value, and is used to store information that is specific to the object it is attached to  Relations An important use of attributes is to describe the relationships between objects in the ontology. Typically a relation is a property whose value is another object in the ontology  Events Events in a system play an important role in describing the nature, timing and effects of interaction between various objects Knowledge discovery from data is a process that aims to extract potentially useful knowledge hidden in large data sets However, it remains a crucial issue to elicit relevant models according domain expert knowledge. The KEOPS approach is based on a method which refers to expert knowledge all along a knowledge extraction process. Furthermore, KEOPS uses a part-way interestingness measure between objective and subjective measure in order to evaluate models relevance according to expert knowledge  The work has been proposed by Laurent Brisson and Martine Collar   It is more accurate to state that the approach has parameters that must  be tuned. When surveying the literature on this topic, it was noted that while there are many techniques for automatically tuning parameters, many of these techniques themselves have parameters, possibly resulting in an infinite regression. An additional problem of parameter-laden algorithms is that they make it difficult to reproduce published experimental results and to understand the contribution of a proposed algorithm These perils of parameter laden algorithms have been proposed by Eamonn Keogh  T h e s e pe r i l s  ha v e be e n de a l t  with accordingly in the proposed system of work

The proposed work aims at creating a knowledge base across heterogeneous web sources. The base hence created will perform the functions of a Recommendation System  Given a system of heterogeneous web sources the work first creates a knowledge base by mapping various datasets distributed geographically and reduces the sets to gain relevant patterns. Based on the association rules gathered from patterns a recommendation system is created. Finally the knowledge gathered from patterns is presented to the end user after implementation of the data visualization module. A method used to conserve bandwidth is the Compression Based Dissimilarity model. The dissimilarity model is described as follows Given two strings x and y the Compression based Dissimilarity Model is defined as follows CDM\(x, y\    C \(xy\ \(C\(x\ C\(y When two strings x and y are not related the CDM value is close to 1 and smaller than 1 by a larger value when x and y are related. But it is to be noted that CDM\(x, x\ is not zero  2. THE COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM 2.1 Implementation Issues For highly complex data with mutual relationships, the derived patterns tend to be complex. Thus implementation challenges are as follows  1. The patterns described by the existing knowledge extraction algorithms are still too abstract for general understanding. A pattern that is misinterpreted is of great danger. For example many algorithms do not distinguish between causality and cooccurrence. For an application that aims at finding the reason for a certain type of disease, there is a great difference between finding the origin of the disease and finding just an additional symptom. Developing systems which derive understandable patterns and making already derived patterns understandable is a challenge 2. As stated, current algorithms focus on a limited set of standard patterns. Deriving these patterns often does not yield a direct and complete solution to many problems Furthermore, with an increasing complexity of the analyzed data, it is likely that the derived patterns will increase in complexity as well. Thus, the challenge lies in finding richer patterns 3. The final challenge arises when working with future patterns due to the increased number of valid patterns Therefore, the number of potentially valid patterns will be too large to be handled by a human user, without a system organizing the results. Hence future systems deal with providing a platform for pattern exploration where users can browse for knowledge on a personalized basis 4 Storing Frequent Item-sets using tries is another major issue. In existing algorithms frequent item-sets that are not needed by the algorithm can be written to the disk, and memory can be freed. Frequent items of size y 001 only are needed for the candidate generation of  y\001 0011  item-sets, and later they are not used. Hence there is need for memory conservation  To conclude, systems should generate a large variety of well understandable patterns. Due to variations in the parameterizations, the number of possibly meaningful and useful patterns will dramatically increase and thus, an important aspect is managing and visualizing these patterns    Figure 2.1: Class Diagram for Implementation Issues  2.2 Overview of the proposed Collective Intelligence Architecture In the knowledge extraction and data visualization framework several sub modules like, implementation of distributed web sources, pattern mining in the compressed knowledge base, implementation of compression algorithms and creation of data visualization exist  2.2.1 Implementation of distributed web sources  Distributed web sources provide the user an advantage of having to distribute data geographically. Apart from data, even processes are distributed geographically thereby, making the execution process faster and easier from the resource requirement point of view. Hadoop distributed file system \(HDFS\ clusters are used to create heterogeneous web sources 2.2.2 Pattern mining in the compressed knowledge base  Form the compressed knowledge base that contains various related item sets from the given dataset, various patterns have to be extracted and irrelevant patterns have to be pruned. Various queries with and without parameters have be executed to implement this module. Parameter-light algorithms tend to produce results of higher accuracy 2.2.3 Implementation of compression algorithms  In order to conserve the bandwidth and relax certain other constraints the compression is implemented using runlength encoding. From here the dissimilarity and similarity measures are calculated

2.2.4 Implementation of trie-based apriori approach Once the trie data structure is constructed as per requirements the dataset and knowledge base are processed. Frequent items sets are scanned to generate various patterns. A recommendation system is created based on the Pearson and Euclidean mathematical models 2.2.5 Creation of data visualization The result set is parsed and an intermediate representation in the form of graphs and charts is created. The intermediate result is translated to a visualization structure. The visualization structure is classified based on recommendations created  3 System Architecture HDFS has master/slave architecture. An HDFS cluster consists of a single Namenode a master server that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients. In addition, there are a number of Datanodes  usually one per node in the cluster, which manage storage attached to the nodes that they run on. HDFS exposes a file system namespace and allows user data to be stored in files Internally, a file is split into one or more blocks and these blocks are stored in a set of Datanodes. The Namenode executes file system namespace operations like opening closing, and renaming files and directories. It also determines the mapping of blocks to Datanodes. The Datanodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from the file systems clients. The Datanodes also perform block creation deletion, and replication upon instruction from the Namenode  Hence is a brief description of system architecture. The same architecture will be deployed later with respect to an application which will bring out practical and commercial purposes involved in implementing the work proposed. The architecture helps in distributing processes across a group of systems NAME NODE METADATA CLIENT REPLICATION BLOCK DATA NODES BLACK OPERATIONS READ METADATA OPERATIONS WRITE RACK 1 RACK 2 CLIENT NAME NODE METADATA CLIENT REPLICATION BLOCK DATA NODES BLACK OPERATIONS READ METADATA OPERATIONS WRITE RACK 1 RACK 2 CLIENT  Figure 3.1:  System architecture 4 Real Time Analysis and Application e-Business \(electronic business\, is the conduct of business on the Internet, not only buying and selling but also servicing customers and collaborating with business partners Today, major corporations are rethinking their businesses in terms of the Internet and its new culture and capabilities Companies are using the Web to buy parts and supplies from other companies, to collaborate on sales promotions, and to do joint research. Exploiting the convenience, availability, and world-wide reach of the Internet, is the trend of recent times The following are the challenges or limitations in the eBusiness domain presently Complex parameters During various analysis operations like business process intelligence or customer relationship management queries include with them complex parameters that are hard to parse and many times they tend to produce malicious results because of their false and complex nature Integration into complete solution Using various techniques like knowledge extraction and analytical processing of multidimensional data, intermediate results should be deciphered into complete solutions in order to complete the analytical process The above challenges can be overcome by using the following solutions Text categorization The aim of this stage is to extract content and using data build topic hierarchy. Once, a hierarchy is built it becomes easier to track customer operations and hence analyze the customer behavior. Analysis operations performed are Extraction of key words and phrases, Transformation of documents and query log records into vectors, Creation of clusters hierarchically, labeling each cluster with significant words, phrases, normalization Catalog creation and service discovery This stage aims to achieve  Attribute extraction and Data formulation. Once a document structure is recognized attribute extraction and data formulation become easier Business Process Intelligence The goal of this stage is to improve the quality of business services and processes. The recommendation system by providing apt and complete recommendations improves the quality of the system  4.1 Application Oriented Architecture  Architecture for the recommendation system based on the collective intelligence system is described as follows The recommendation system is created to test the real-time application and feasibility of collective intelligence system 4.1.1 Proposed Methodology The proposed methodology operates on a distributed file system environment based on the SOAP \(Service oriented architecture protocol\ ontology. The triangular ontology deals with service registry, service provision and remote method invocation. Hadoop clusters are used for this purpose 
294 


4.1.2 User Layer Customer/Buyer Domain: The customer/buyer domain consists of various customers and buyers who represent the clients of the architecture. A customer or buyer is any remote device seeking to analyze various data sets based on certain queries. The customer seeks access to a remote service on the service domain that analyses datasets. These remote services have direct access to a remote database Hence the customers represented in this domain have indirect access to a remote database with service domain activity as an intermediary stage  4.1.3 Collective Intelligence Layer Application Server Proxy The application server proxy performs the function of a routing table. The customer in the user layer searches for various services that are available on the distributed file system. While doing so, the first component a customers service query will approach is the application server proxy. The application server proxy contains a table or list of various services available on the distributed file system. Hence all the analysis services have to first register themselves with the application proxy server in order for the customer to access these services. When a service wanted by the customer is available on the service domain, the proxy deploys a remote server where this service is available to the customer  Service Domain The service domain mainly consists of one primary service, namely the recommendation system The recommendation system used here deals with recommending items for users given a rated and uninformed data set. That is, the data set that serves as the base or input will contain a list of item sets that are ranked by users using the item set. The final output will be an intelligent recommendation of unused item sets for a particular user. The item sets can be any product like books, movies, gadgets services, techniques etc. based on the real time dataset provided as input Semantic Data Visualizer The output of the analysis service machines needs to be presented in a graphical understandable and user-friendly manner to the end user who is the customer or buyer. The semantic data visualizer involves a semantic index that is used in tandem with the analytical output. The semantic parameters involved vary with each analysis. Graphs and charts are created as intermediate results \(IR\. The IR is then used to map the output onto predetermined visualization structures 4.1.4 Data Layer The data layer is the core and heart of the entire architecture. The layer has one main component: the remote data set. The remote data set is a set of item sets that are linked to each other by way of ratings. The item sets consist of customer identities and various other e-Business customer fields like products purchased, time logs, costs incurred billing information and other logs. The analysis service provider servers have independent direct access to this remote data set  5 Algorithms  The collective intelligence system hence proposed uses a platter of assorted algorithms and following are the algorithms that are being put into use in the collective intelligence system  5.1 Compression based dissimilarity measure     5.2 Frequent Pattern mining  Function dist = cdm\(a,b Save a.txtaascii    Zip\(a.zip, a.txt    A_file = dir\(a.zip    Save b.txt b ascii    Zip\(b.zip, b.txt    B_file = dir\(b.zip    A_n_b = [a       Save a_n_b.txt a_n_b ascii   Zip\(a_n_b.zip, a_n_b.txt   A_n_b_file = dir \(a_n_b.zip   Dist = a_n_b_file.bytes / \(a_file.bytes + b_file.bytes Return Dist End 1.

C2 consists of all combinations of 2-itemsets and check for the property that states all nonempty subsets of frequent itemsets must also be frequent

 6 Results and graphs  The following are the two sections in which a few results have been inferred from the graphs plotted 6.1Construction and destruction time for stored filtered transactions Primarily no difference is observed when data sets are too small, as seen in Fig 6.1. However, the sorted lists tend to slow down as data set grows. RB-trees are always faster than tries, but the difference is not significant. In support count, each filtered transaction has to be visited to determine the contained candidates. If transactions are stored in a sorted list, then going through the elements is a very fast operation In the case of RB-trees and trie, this operation is slower, since a tree has to be traversed. Hence a sorted list is used despite the slowness during large data sets, due to easy traversal options  Fig 6.1: Time Vs Threshold  6.2 Writing frequent item-sets to disk The fastest results are obtained if frequent item-sets are not stored in memory but written to disk in the candidate generation process, as seen in Fig 6.2. In cases of determining small and medium sized candidates most edges lead to leaves hence removing other edges does not accelerate the algorithm too much. Hence, the memory needs can be significantly reduced if frequent item-sets are not stored in memory Consequently if frequent item-sets are needed to determine valid association rules and memory consumption is an important factor, then it is useful to write frequent item-sets to disk and read them back when the association rule discovery phase starts   7 Conclusion and future implementation The proposed collective intelligence system is hence implemented and its applications are tested using the real-time recommendation system in an e-business background. The    Fig 6.2: Time Vs Threshold recommendations hence created based on collective intelligence are accurate to a greater extent. The collective intelligence system can be extended in lines of semantic web searching to provide personalized results and optimized link retrievals. Furthermore, a mechanism or structure can be created to improve on the performance of sorted lists in case of large data sets to decrease the time complexity of creation of the filtered transactions from the data set  REFERENCES 1 Ea m o n n K e o g h  S t ef a n o Lo n a r d i Li Wei  Compression Based Data Mining of Sequential Data Springer, March 2007  e dr o D o m i n g o s   Towards Knowledge rich data mining  Springer, April 2007  r e g o r y P i a t e t s k i S h a p i r o   Data Mining and knowledge discovery from 1996-2005, Springer, January 2007 4 La u r en t B r i s s o n  an d M a r t in e C o l l ar d   An Ontology Driven data mining process, The KEOPS approach November 2006  a ur e n t B r i s s o n  Knowledge extraction using a conceptual information system ODBIS Workshop in VLDB Conference, Seoul, 2006 6 A b r a h a m B e r n s t e i n  F o s t e r P r o v o s t, a n d S h aw n d r a H ill   Toward intelligent assistance for a data mining process: An ontology-based approach for cost-sensitive classification  IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 2005 7 B a r o n c h e ll i A  C a g l io ti E  L o r e to V   Artificial sequences and complexity measures J.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
