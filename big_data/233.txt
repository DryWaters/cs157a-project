This paper, concerned with these automated methods, \nattempts to improve Gloss Vector semantic relatedness \nmeasure for more reliable estimation of relatedness between \ntwo input concepts. Generally, this measure by considering \nfrequency cut-off for bigrams tries to remove low and high \nfrequency words which usually do not end up being significant \nfeatures However, this naive cutting approach can lead to loss \nof valuable information. By employing pointwise mutual ninformation \(PMI elimination step in \na statistical fashion.

INTRODUCTION\nHow do you relate “egg” to “sperm” in a biomedical \ncontext? What about “egg” and “incubation”? And how \nwould you interpret /???.r?l/ \(aural and oral phonetic \npronunciation when you hear it in a lecture about an ear \ndisease? Humans, due to possession of cognitive knowledge \nwith respect to word meanings, have an ability to answer \nabove questions through semantic judgment of relatedness nfor the involved concepts. Developing intelligent algorithms \nwhich automatically imitate this ability is Holy Grail of \nmany natural language processing \(NLP CL quantification of lexical \nsemantic relatedness has applications in a wide range of \ntasks for both general and specific domains of knowledge. \nMuthaiyah and Kerschberg [1] by considering available \nmeasures of semantic relatedness provided the SRS \nframework for ontology schema matching. Pekar et al. [2] \napplied these functions to the QALL-ME ontology to \nimprove a question answering system in the tourism domain. \nPatwardhan et al. [3] implemented semantic relatedness \nmeasures in the task of word sense disambiguation \(WSD et al. [4] employed them in machine translation. \nFor the biomedical domain, Bousquet et al. [5] investigated ncodification of medical diagnoses and adverse drug reactions \nusing semantic relatedness and semantic similarity measures. \nThe output of a relatedness measure is a value, ideally \nnormalized between 0 and 1 indicating how semantically \nrelated two given words are. Generally, there are two models \nof computational technique that relatedness measures get \ndivided into, taxonomy-based and distributional models. \n In taxonomy-based model, proposed measures take \nadvantage of hand-crafted lexical structures such as ntaxonomies. Measures developed based on this model largely \ndeal with semantic similarity measurement as a specific case \nof semantic relatedness. For general English text, studies on \nmeasuring similarity rely on WordNet, a free lexical \ndatabase, which is a combination of dictionary and thesaurus, \ndesigned for supporting automatic text analysis and artificial \nintelligence applications. In clinical and biomedical studies, \nresearchers employ the Unified Medical Language System \n\(UMLS ontology of medical \nvocabularies maintained by the National Library of \nMedicine. Currently, rapid evolution in domains of \nknowledge \(especially the biomedical domain constructed taxonomies \nwhich is a labor-intensive task. For this reason and because \nof limitation in scope and scalability, similarity measures \ndesigned based on taxonomies are at a disadvantage. \nThe notion behind distributional model comes from Firth \nidea \(1957  keeps”. Therefore, for the measures of this kind, \nwords specifications get derived from their co-occurrence ndistribution in a corpus. These co-occurred features of words \nwill be represented in a vector space for future computation \nof relatedness. Richness of document corpora, used for \ninformation extraction \(e.g bi-grams and noisy nature of extracted information \ndemands a purification phase to remove those features which \nare insignificant for calculation of more reliable estimations. \nGloss Vector semantic relatedness measure is a ndistributional-based approach which has a broad application \nin text mining and information retrieval. The procedure of \nthis measure employs the low and high frequency cut-off for \ndetection and elimination of insignificant features. In this \npaper, we show that this way of purification has its own \nproblems.

appropriately in a statistical fashion. \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. \nSection II briefly presents proposed semantic similarity and \nrelatedness measures and their drawbacks. In Section III we \nlist data and resources employed for our experiments in the \nbiomedical domain. In Section IV, our method for statistical \nremoval of insignificant words is described. In Section V, \nexperiments and analysis are given. Finally, the conclusions \nand the future studies are stated in Section VI. \nII. RELATED WORKS\nThe proposed measures in the literature dealing with \nsemantic aspect of the words are classifiable from two ndifferent perspectives, 1 whether the \nmeasure addresses semantic relatedness or semantic \nsimilarity. Similarity in words can be seen as a specific case \nof relatedness, e.g. “bleeding” and “hemorrhage” are similar \nwords but “blood” and hemorrhage” are just related. In \nother words, similarity implies a strict form of relatedness \nbut the reverse is not true. We will distinct semantic \nsimilarity from semantic relatedness as they have napplications of their own for some specific tasks. \nA. Semantic Similarity Measures \nMeasures of semantic similarity are dependent on a \nhierarchical structure of concepts derived from taxonomies \nor thesauruses. In this regard, a concept is specific sense of a \nword \(polysemy for two different concepts of “the part of the heart that \nreceives blood from the veins” and “the part of the ear that is \noutside the head and is made of cartilage”. One concept can \nalso have different representative words \(synonymy from the veins” concept. The \nhierarchical structures of the concepts may get equipped with \nrelations including is-a, has-part, and is-a-part-of. Semantic \nsimilarity measures employ positional information of the nconcepts in the taxonomy to estimate how similar two input \nconcepts are. Fig. 1 illustrates part of a disease taxonomy. \nFigure 1. A small portion of a disease taxonomy. \nPath measure [7] is a simple similarity technique based \non the calculation of the reciprocal of the shortest path from \none input concept to another in the taxonomy. In path \nmeasure for finding shortest path between a pair of concepts \nwe count nodes \(number of jumps/paths incremented by 1 go down from the root towards leaves. \nIn order to deal with the problem of path measure, Wu \nand Palmer [8 propose a method which is based on both \npath and depth of the concepts. By using least common \nsubsumer \(LCS of the two concepts they determined how \nspecific in meaning the two input concepts can be. From \ninformation retrieval points of view, when one concept is \nless frequent than the other one, it is more informative. This ninformativeness quality denotes abstractness or concreteness \nin meaning for the concepts, so it is important for semantic \nsimilarity measurement. Path and depth based similarity \nmeasures lack consideration of this distinctive attribute. \nIn order to measure how informative one concept is, we \nneed to know frequency of that concept in an external \ncorpus. Resnik introduced this characteristic of a concept as \nits information content IC  measured two concepts similarity through calculating IC \nvalue of their LCS in a taxonomy. Jiang and Conrath 10] \nand Lin [ 11] in their studies improved accuracy of estimated \nsimilarity based on concepts’ ICs However, the process of \nIC calculation for a concept is a challenging task. Absence of \nthe concept’s representative word\(s for \nmeasuring its frequency are just some problematic issues for IC computation. \nPesaranghader and Muthaiyah [12] in their study, after nenumerating drawbacks of IC computation in the scalar \nform, introduce IC vectors which rely on the definitions of \nthe concepts and their constituent words. They propose that \nthe cosine of the angle between IC vectors of the two input \nconcepts put together and IC vector of their LSC is a more \nreliable and effective way of semantic similarity estimation. \nThe dependency on taxonomy relations can be a \ndisadvantage in semantic similarity measures as taxonomies \ntend to be static and cannot keep up with the rapidly \nchanging structure of knowledge in a given discipline. \nB. Semantic Relatedness Measures \nMeasures of semantic relatedness mostly rely on \ndistributional properties of concepts in large text corpora as \nan easier way to keep track of changes in a given knowledge \ndomain. Nonetheless, Lesk [13] calculate the strength of nrelatedness between a pair of concepts as a function of the \noverlap between their definitions by considering their \nconstituent words. Banerjee and Pedersen [14] proposed the \nExtended Gloss Overlap measure \(also known as Adapted \nLesk to it in WordNet \nfor an improved result. The main drawback in these \nmeasures is their strict reliance on concepts definitions and \nnegligence of other knowledge source. \nTo address forging limitation in the Lesk-type measures, \nPatwardhan and Pedersen [15] introduced the Gloss Vector \n19287\nmeasure by joining together both ideas of concepts \ndefinitions from a thesaurus and co-occurrence data from a \ncorpus. In their approach, every word in the definition of the \nconcept from WordNet is replaced by its context vector from 


nthe co-occurrence data from a corpus and relatedness is \ncalculated as the cosine of the angle between the two input \nconcepts associated vectors \(gloss vectors 1 has no need for an underlying \nstructure. Therefore, in another study, Liu et al. [16] \nextended the Gloss Vector measure and applied it as Second \nOrder Context Vector measure to the biomedical domain. \nThe UMLS was used for driving concepts definitions and \nbiomedical corpuses were employed for co-occurrence data nextraction. In brief, this method gets completed by five steps \nwhich sequentially are, 1 co-occurrence matrix \nfrom a biomedical corpus, 2 cut-off, 3 results of step 3 and 4, and 5 pairs \nalready scored by biomedical experts, they evaluated Second \nOrder Context Vector measure through Spearman's rank \ncorrelation coefficient. Fig. 2 illustrates the entire procedure. \n... ... ... ... ...\n nFigure 2. 5 steps of Gloss Vector relatedness measure \nAs a clarifying example, after constructing co-occurrence \nmatrix from MEDLINE, low and high frequency cut-off for \nremoving insignificant bigrams from this matrix gets \nenforced. For the concept cancer with the UMLS definition \nof “A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide \nwithout control and can invade nearby tissue”, the second norder co-occurrence vector will be constructed. For this \npropose, after removing stop-words and applying porter \nstemming on the definition, all available first-order \nco-occurrence vectors \(from cut-off step the words \nappeared in cancer definition which are disease, abnormal, \ncell, divide, control, invade and tissue will be added together. \nIn this sample we used only definition of the concept and not \nits extended definition reachable by appendage of definitions \nof its directly linked concepts. For other concepts, the nprocedure of second order co-occurrence vector construction \nis the same. In order to find the semantic relatedness between \ntwo concepts we need to find the cosine of the angle between \ntheir computed second order co-occurrence vectors. \nThis paper mainly deals with Gloss Vector’s low/high \nfrequency cut-off phase. We show this naive approach of \ncutting is indecisive and causes loss of valuable information. \nThis is because first, we believe when a concept is specific \n\(or concrete or ninformative specific in the \nmeaning has less frequency in the corpus compared to those \nterms which are general \(or abstract gliosarcomas \(as a specific kind of cancer spinal cord which contain malignant neuroectodermal \n\(glial spindle-\nshaped fibrosarcoma cells”. We can see that gliosarcomas is \ndescribed with more specific and detailed terms which are \nnaturally less frequent in the corpus. Therefore, the \nabovementioned issues call into question the idea of fixed \nfrequency cut-off points as by removing the low frequency \nterms we face a trouble defining concepts like gliosarcomas.\nWhen we set a high frequency cut-off point, we try to \nremove bigrams which are naturally compound words \(e.g. \nspinal cord e.g. commit suicide the \nrelative occurrences of compound words and collocations \nwhich depend on their level of concreteness setting absolute \nhigh frequency point also sacrifices some useful information. \nIn Section IV, we explain our approach developed based \non pointwise mutual information \(PMI To show the reliability of our \nproposed approach we examined both way of insignificant \nwords \(bigrams removal in our experiments. The results of \nexperiments along with the discussion are presented in \nSection V In the following section we list experimental \nresources of our experiments in the biomedical domain. \nIII EXPERIMENTAL DATA\nResources in the study are a thesaurus to find the \nconcepts definitions, a corpus to extract co-occurrence data \nfed to the semantic relatedness measure, and a dataset used \nfor final evaluation against human judgment. \nA. UMLS \nThe Unified Medical Language System1 \(UMLS framework designed to support \nbiomedical and clinical research. Its fundamental usage is \nprovision of a database of biomedical terminologies for \nencoding information contained in electronic medical \nrecords and medical decision support. It comprises over 160 \nterminologies and classification systems, and Medical nSubject Headings \(MeSH in the \nlife sciences. Our tested concepts all belong to the MeSH \nvocabulary. In this research we have employed 2012AB \nrelease of the UMLS containing the latest update of MeSH.\n n1 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls\n19398\nB. MEDLINE Abstract \nMEDLINE2 contains over 20 million biomedical articles \nfrom 1966 to the present. The database covers journal \narticles from almost every field of biomedicine including \nmedicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, \nand 


healthcare. For the current study we used MEDLINE \narticle abstracts as the corpus to build a first order term-term \nco-occurrence matrix for later computation of second order \nco-occurrence matrix. We used the 2013 MEDLINE abstract. \nC. Reference Standard \nThe reference standard3 in our experiments is a set of \nscored medical concept pairs from University of Minnesota \nMedical School as a result of their experimental study 17]. \nEight medical residents were invited for participation in \nscoring the relatedness of these concept pairs in order to have \nthem voted based on human judgment. Some of the concepts \nfrom original reference standard are not included in the \nMeSH ontology applied in our experiments. Therefore, after \nremoving them from the original dataset, a subset of 311 \nconcept pairs for testing Gloss Vector semantic relatedness nmeasure, using two different approaches of insignificant \nfeatures elimination discussed in this study, was available. \nIV. METHODS\nAs already mentioned, the main attempt of this paper is \nto avoid concomitant difficulties from implementing the low \nand high frequency cut-off of bigrams in Gloss Vector \nrelatedness measure \(or Second Order Co-occurrence \nVectors cut-off without considering the level of dependency \nof two terms \(words nbeneficial as well as expressive amount of information. \nTherefore, before considering any strict low and high cut-off \npoints to remove insignificant features, we need to measure \nthe relative level of association between terms in a bigram. \nPointwise mutual information \(PMI information theory and statistics. In \ncomputational linguistics, PMI for two given terms indicates \nthe likelihood of finding one term in a text document that \nincludes the other term. PMI measure is formulated as n\n P P\n P\nlog PMI\n21\n21\n21 \n  \nP\(t1,t2 co-occur in a \nsame document, and P\(t1 t2 occurrence in a document  \nThe result of PMI measure represents how associated the \nterms t1 and t2 are, by considering frequencies of t1 and t2\nindividually \(marginal probability t2\nco-occurred \(joint probability low frequency but \nthey can be associated with and descriptive of each other. \nThe problem of the conventional low and high frequency \n                                                          \n2 http://mbr.nlm.nih.gov/index.shtml\n3 http://rxinformatics.umn.edu/data/UMNSRS_relatedness.csv\ncut-off in Gloss Vector measure is that it takes into account \nonly frequency of t1 and t2 co-occurred in the context without nbeing concerned about frequencies of t1 and t2 individually. \nWe take advantage of PMI for our proposed approach of \ninsignificant features \(terms measure into the Gloss Vector \nmeasure procedure, in our approach, we 1 cut-off step in Gloss Vector measure 2 order co-occurrence matrix, 3 nco-occurrence matrix to find relative association of concepts \n\(rows of matrix columns of matrix entire procedure of our proposed \nsemantic relatedness measure using PMI.  \n3\n4\n1\nC1\nC2\nCn\nw1\nC3\nw2 w3 wn...\nConcept \nDefinition\nCUI Definition\nNarrower/Broader\nAssociate Terms\nParent/Children\nUMLS\nC1\nC2\nCm\nw1 w2 w3 wn...\n18 21 7 9\n5 16 4 21\n5 17 1 13...\n...\n...\nC3 11 2 3 18...\nC1\nC2\nCm\nw1 w2 w3 wn...\n0.2 5.9 3.7 6.1\n5.2 0.6 3.8 3.0\n3.5 1.1 0.9 2.1...\n...\n...\nC3 6.3 2.4 4.1 1.2...\nW1\nW2\nWn\nw1\nW3\nw2 w3 wn...\n0 3 9 16\n3 0 24 2\n9 24 0 45\n16 2 45 0...\n...\n...\n...\n5\n2\nscan corpus and \ncount the bigrams\nbuild the first order \nco-occurrence matrix\nMEDLINE\nfind cosine of the angle for \ntwo concepts associated vectors\napply low/high level of association \ncut-off on PMI-on-SOC matrix\n\nC1\nC2\nsimC1 ,C2 = cosine 1.1 0.9 2.1...\n...\n...\n6.3 2.4 4.1 1.2...\n4\n6\nbuild the PMI-on-SOC matrix\nusing add-one technique\nbuild the normalized second\norder co-occurrence matrix\nconstruct extended definitions\nfor concepts using UMLS\nCi = \(Wd Wf + … + Wj P P\n P\nlogPMI\nji\nji\nw,C ji \n\nFigure 3. 6 steps of Gloss Vector measure with PMI cut-off approach \nIn Gloss Vector relatedness measure, for constructing \nsecond order co-occurrence vector known as gloss vector definition get summed together. For \napplying PMI on the second order co-occurrence matrix \nproperly, we need to have all the vectors normalized first. To \nconstruct a normalized second order co-occurrence vector for \na concept, after adding all first order co-occurrence vectors \nof the constituent words in its definition, we will divide the \nresult vector by the quantity of these added vectors. \nV. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nIf we consider words w1, w2, w3, … and wn as an initial \nset of features which construct n×n first order co-occurrence \nmatrix, in practice, only a subset of these words is valuable \nand significant for measuring semantic relatedness. \nTherefore, by applying any cut-off approach, the aim is to \nremove those features which are not really helpful. \nNevertheless, going overboard in this elimination process by \nremoving too many of 


them, while a quantity of them are \n1942009\nstill informative, will hurt the expected outcome. For this nreason, implementation of an appropriate cut-off approach is \nthe deciding factor. It is also important to know that \nminimizing memory size of the last matrix which contains \nconcepts vectors used for relatedness measurements is \ncollateral benefit of insignificant features removal. \nFor insignificant features detection and elimination, our \nexperiments examine two approaches. First approach is the \nconventional way of the low and high frequency cut-off on \nthe first order co-occurrence matrix. Second approach, \nproposed in this study is the low and high level of \nassociation from PMI measure cut-off. As a general rule of \nthumb, PMI has a limitation for selecting strongly associated \nbigrams as it is biased towards low frequency words. In \norder to resolve this weakness, the simple but helpful add-\none technique is employed. In add-one technique, before napplying PMI on a matrix, all the elements of the matrix will \nbe incremented by 1 unit. In our experiments for PMI-based \ninsignificant features removal the results of both ways, with \nand without add-one technique are shown and discussed. \nTable 1, taking all abovementioned cut-off approaches \ninto consideration, shows the Spearman’s rank correlations \nof semantic relatedness measurements of 311 concept pairs \ncompared with reference standard of them scored by medical \nresidents. The represented results are the best generated ncorrelations by 1 order \nco-occurrence matrices, and, 2 PMI Low/High Correlation \nfrequency cut-off 0.3523 \nlevel of association cut-off \(no add-one cut-off \(by add-one that our proposed approach, \ndepending on PMI, has achieved higher Spearman’s rank \ncorrelation. In addition by comparing the results of level of \nassociation cut-off, it is noticeable that PMI-based approach \nof insignificant features removal yields better result when we \napply add-one technique. Considering represented results, \nFig. 4 illustrates the distribution of relatedness for 311 \nconcept pairs for the PMI-based level of association cut-off \n\(with add-one horizontal axis based on their human \nvoted scores of relatedness. \nIn order to find optimal points of low and high frequency \ncut-off, first we need to know different ranges that values of \nthe matrices can fall into. In frequency cut-off this range \nvaries from 0 to 124’356 in first order co-occurrence matrix. \nIn the level of association cut-off applied on the second order \nco-occurrence matrix, by considering that all negative values ngenerated by PMI measure get replaced by 0, the ranges are \n0 to 6.73 and 0 to 12.35 with and without add-one technique \nrespectively. From these ranges we can estimate that without \nimplementing add-one technique PMI tends to overvalue the \nlevel of association in low frequent events. \nFigure 4. Gloss Vector distribution on ordered pairs for cut-off approaches  \nThrough different examinations to discover the best \npossible elimination points, in frequency cut-off, we found \n650 as the low and 14’500 as the high removal points finest \nfor frequency elimination in bigrams. It means bigrams with \nthe frequency values beyond this range are ignored. For the \nlevel of association cut-off, using add-one technique, 1.55 is \nthe best minimum threshold for more accurate relatedness \nestimations while considering high threshold was not \nhelpful Moreover, without applying add-one technique, 3 \nand 7 are the best low and high level of association cut-off npoints on PMI-on-SOC matrix. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the \ncorrelation changes in different cut-off points of frequency \nand level of association. For example, ignoring add-one \ntechnique, after removing PMI results with values less than \n2.5 and more than 7.5 from PMI-on-SOC matrix, we \nachieved a correlation score of 0.4514. In these selected \nranges, all 26’958 concepts in MeSH \(excluding root Further cutoffs beyond these \nareas can lead to the loss of concepts vectors which will \nhinder future measurement of relatedness for these concepts. \nFigure 5. Gloss Vector Spearman correlation for different cut-off points \n1952010\nDiscussing about attempts to find the best subset of \nimportant features from an initial set of words, Table 2 \nrepresents out of 289’947 initial words \(features remained after cut-off approaches applied in \ntheir best possible points. \nTABLE II. INFORMATION CONTENTS AND CONCEPT AVAILABLE FOR \nCut-off Approach \(Low/High nlevel of association cut-off \(no add-one by add-one 68’351 / 289’947 \nEvaluating Table 2 information, the excessive removal of \nfeatures in conventional frequency cut-off approach is \nbecause of sole concern of bigrams frequency and not taking \nindividual frequencies of terms into account. The difference \nbetween the level of association cut-off results, with and \nwithout add-one, is because of PMI’s overestimation of low \nfrequency bigrams. Comparing the level of association ncut-off using add-one technique against the frequency \ncut-off, we see that many features are kept as informative \nwords and this is the main reason for higher correlation result \nin this approach.  \nVI 


CONCLUSIONS\nConsidering wide applications of Gloss Vector semantic \nrelatedness measure, by implementing PMI-based approach \nfor eliminating insignificant features in this measure, we \ntried to avoid drawback of conventional frequency cut-off \napproach and improve accuracy of estimated relatedness for \nconcept pairs. We found insignificant features elimination in \nthe frequency cut-off approach is problematic as it does not nconsider frequency of individual terms and merely take \nfrequency of bigrams into account. This issue can cause loss \nof many valuable features deciding for more reliable \nrelatedness measurement. Through a slight change in this \nmeasure’s procedure and also applying PMI for determining \nthe level of association among concepts and terms, we could \nfind insignificant terms statistically and more appropriately. \nIn future works for insignificant features removal, other \nstatistical measure of association can be examined to see \ntheir impact on the computed outputs. Additionally, our \nproposed approach can be tested on extrinsic tasks such as nword sense disambiguation, and get evaluated in the domains \nof knowledge other than the biomedical domain nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

have worse \nweak scaling. \n4.5 Generating Large Networks \nOur main goal for designing this algorithm is to generate \nvery large random networks. Using our algorithm with the \nRRP scheme, we are able to generate a network with 50 \nbillion edges, with n = IE and x = 5. Using 768 processors, \nthe generation of this network takes only 123 seconds. \n4.6 Partitioning and Load Balancing \nN ode partitioning has significant effects on load balanc­\ning and performance of the algorithm. In Section 3.5, we \nhave discussed three partitioning schemes UCP, LCP and \nRRP, and theoretically analyzed them. In this section, we \nexperimentally study these schemes and their effect on the \nperformance of the algorithm. In these experiments, we use \nn = 108 nodes, x 10 edges per node, and 160 processors. \n160 processors are sufficient to demonstrate the behavior and ndifferences of the partitioning schemes. For each of the three \nschemes, we measure the computational load in the proces­\nsors by the number of nodes per processor, the number of \noutgoing messages from the processors and the number of \nincoming messages to the processors. The results are shown \nin Figure 7. \n4.6.1 Node Distribution \nThe node distribution is shown in Figure 7\(a uniformly among the pro­\ncessors, and each processor has about 62,500 nodes. For \nLCP, the number of nodes in the processors are increasing \nlinearly with the rank of the processors. \n4.6.2 Message Distribution \nIn a consecutive partitioning \(UCP and LCP and \nreceives incoming messages from processors i + 1 to P - 1 .  \nFor each node, a processor sends a request message with \nprobability at most 1 - p \(see Eqn. 2 a processor is propor­\ntional to the number of nodes in the processor, as shown \nin Figure 7\(b the UCP and LCP schemes, \nprocessor 0 does not need to send any request messages at \nall. \nFigure 7\(c the number of incoming request mes­\nsages for each processor.

Figure 7\( d shows the total load for the three par­\ntitioning schemes. Scheme RRP distributes the load almost \nperfectly among the processors. Load balancing in the LCP \nscheme is also quite good. On the other hand, UCP scheme ndistribute the load very poorly. These experimental results \nverify our theoretical analysis given in Section 3.5. \n5. CONCLUSION \nWe developed a parallel algorithm to generate massive \nscale-free networks using the preferential attachment model. \nWe analyzed the dependency nature of the problem in detail \nthat led to the development of an efficient parallel algorithm \nfor the problem. Various node partitioning schemes and \ntheir effect on the algorithm were discussed as well. Our \nalgorithm produces networks which strictly follow power-law \ndistribution. The linear scalability of our algorithm enables \nus to produce 50 billion edges in just 123 seconds. It will be \ninteresting to develop scalable parallel algorithms for other \nclasses of random networks in the future. \n6. REFERENCES \n[1] R. Albert, H. Jeong, and A.-L. Barabasi.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future.

The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
