Water pollution problem becomes 
increasingly critical in this present-day, whether in developed or developing countries. Sediment is the primary cause of water pollution. The environmental pollution problem can be measured using ground instruments such as turbidity meters for water measurements. Field measurements cannot provide fine spatial resolution maps with detailed distribution pattern over a large study area The study was carried out to verify the validity of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad ministration Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature \(SST\\(NOAA MCSST\algorithm by NOAA at South China Sea. SST is verified by comparing the SST calculated 
by algorithm with sea-truth data collected by Research on the Sea and Islands of Malaysia \(ROSES\ad travelled and collected data at South China Sea from 26 Jun 2004 to 1 August 2004. In this study the transmittance function for each band was modeled using the MODTRAN code and radiosonde data The expression of transmittance as a function of zenith view angle was obtained for each ch annel through regression of the MODTRAN output. The in-situ data \(ship collected SST values cation of results. The derived SST value was compared with the ground truth data collected during Research on th 
e Seas and Islands \(ROSES project and the standard deviation is less than 1 degree Celsius. SST map was created and comparison between the in-situ SST patterns was made in this study. The satellite NOAA AVHRR data used in SST analysis was used for water quality mapping. The DN va lues were converted into radiance values and later reflectance values - AVHRR Radiometric Correction and Calibration. The reflectance values corresponding to the ground truth sample locations were extracted from all the images. In this study, the multidate data were corrected to minimize the difference in atmospheric effects between the scenes. The reflectance values for window size of 3 by 
3 were used because the data set produced higher correlation coefficient and lower RMS value. Finally, an automatic geocoding technique from PCI Geomatica 10.1 - AVHRR Automated Geometric Correction was applied in this study to geocode the SST and TSS maps 1 2  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION  2  2 STUDY AREA  2

  2  1  I NTRODUCTION  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer \(AVHRR data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - \(NOAA have been widely use in oceanographic applications such as sea surface temperature SST mapping and other oceanic phenomena. Due to its high repetitive coverage AVHRR can become a usefull tool for monitoring the oceanic processes  Although conventional shipboard sea surface temperature measurement and water quality measurements produce accurate readings tec hnique is rather slow and expensive. An alternative reliable method can be achieved from satellite measurements. For example, accurate retrieval of SST and total suspended solids \(TSS\ng AVHRR data can be computed using the established algorithm Sea surface temperature \(SST\s have been determined by two basic techniques: i\ regression between coincident satellite brightness temperatures and surface measurements, and ii\atmospheric transmission model with a set of representative vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and absorbing constituents [1 u s alg o r ith m s fo r p erfo rm in g th is task  have been developed; these include the single infrared channel method, the multichannel method and the multiangle method. Recently, the multichannel sea surface temperature \(MCSST\gorithm has been developed by NOAA for AVHRR data Application of regression technique requires a sufficient amount of coincident in-situ data with the remotely sensed data. The requirement is not easily achievable in the equatorial region due to unfavorable sky conditions. Therefore in this study, the algorithm that has been derived theoretically which does not require in-situ SSTs for calibration was used. This algorithm is designed to measure SST using thermal images from any satellite and TSS using visible images. The purpose of this study is to test our developed algorithm using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 226 \(NOAA AVHRR The performance of this algor ithm was compared with the in-situ data 2 STUDY AREA  The study area is South China Sea. It is one of the world's largest seas. The scene selected is covering Peninsular Malaysia and South East Asia. The area is selected because of the fluctuations in SST. There are strong relationships between fluctuations in SST and rainfall variability in the equatorial Pacific The data was from image with level 1B scene from NOAA satellite with AVHRR sensor. It is based on availability of cloud free pixe ls. The image was captured daytime on 29/06/2004, 30/06/2004, 03/07/2004 04/07/2004, 05/07/2004, 08/07/2004, 13/07/2004 and 16/7/2004. In this study, NOAA AVHRR 17 data was used to retrieve SST [2   Figure 1-The location of the study area 3  C LOUD M ASKING T ECHNIQUES  The atmosphere introduces errors in satellite measurements of SST through cloud cover, aerosols, water vapor, reflected sky and the presence of other gases. Clouds dominate the errors introduced into satellite observations of SST Therefore the presence of clouds hinders their application especially in the equatorial region. Successful application of remote sensing data for oceanographic studies such as sea surface temperature measurements depends largely on the accuracy of the cloud removal techniques to eliminate cloud-contaminated pixels for the analysis Methods of cloud removal for satellite data vary from radioactive thresholds to rather complicated procedures involving analysis of texture. The thermal infrared bands were used because the near infrared bands contained some noise. Two techniques were employed, \(a the infrared threshold test or gross cloud check, and \(b\he channel difference. For each image date \(channels 10, 11 and 12\containing clouds and cloud free water pixels were extracted for detailed study us ing each technique mentioned above. After the data were passed through the series of tests described earlier, the combined cloud masks were finally obtained  3.1 The infrared threshold test or gross cloud check This method uses 12 \265m \(channel 5\ghtness temperatures. Channel 5 is used because clouds have greater optical thickness at this band. Pixel will be flagged as cloudy if the calculated temperature is less than a predefined threshold value. Th e thresholds have to be determined form the histogram of the brightness temperature generated image. This test is applicable for both day and night scenes. This method is not capable of detecting a warm low cloud above the sea  3.2 The channel difference The emissivity difference of low cloud and fog at 3.7 \265m 


  3 and 11 \265m provides an effective test at night for the detection. The emissivity of stratus or fog is greater at 11\265m than at 3.7 \265m. This technique is usefull since uniform low cloud at night is the most difficult to detect with either the infrared or the spatial coherence method The test using T 3.7 T 12 is useful for detecting pixels partially filled with cloud, se mitransparent cloud and most medium-level and high-level clouds. Thin cirrus cloud is easily detected by this met hod because this cloud provides higher differences in transmissivity and single scattering albedo between 3.7 \265m and 11 \265m The temperature differences between T 4 and T 5 can be applied to both day time and night-time. This test is effective in detecting thin cirrus cloud and the edges of thicker cloud. This technique can be used to detect most types of clouds except for uniform low cloud. For clear sky radiances, the difference are less \( often < 1 K\ut will vary with total column water amount and satellite zenith angle Over cloud the brightness temperature differences are higher than over the clear sea water. All pixels with T 4 T 5 T diff threshold for temperature difference identified as cloud contaminated  4  A LGORITHM M ODEL   4.1 SST Model The model of computation SST is possible with the AVHRR, an instrument with three infrared \(IR 3]. In this study, we com pute the sea surface temperature using the three AVHRR thermal bands \(layers 3, 4, and 5 and AVHRR sensor calibration information. This module uses the McClain method for atmospheric correction. SST computes the Celsius temperat ure for every pixel in an image, regardless of whether it represents land or water however, only the temperature values for oceans will be precise. Temperature values for land, cloud, or inland water bodies can be used as rough i ndicators if necessary, but in general should be ignored  Four algorithms are available, one for daytime data and three for nighttime data: Day MCSST Split; Night MCSST Split; Night MCSST Dual; and Night MCSST Triple. These algorithms differ in which bands are used to correct for the atmosphere Split-window uses bands 4 and 5, Dual-window uses bands 3 and 4, and Triple-window uses bands 3, 4 and 5. The coefficients used for the NOAA 15, 16, and 17 satellites are based on values provided in the NOAA KLM User's Guide. In this study, Day MCSST Split algorithm was used to retrieve SST from NOAA AVHRR  Current retrieval algorithms for sea surface temperature from AVHRR are based largely upon the MCSST algorithm [4 ich m ay b e written as SST=A 1 A 2 T4 +A 3 T4 - T5 4 T4 - T5 sec 1 1  where A 1 A 2 A 3 and A 4 are algorithm coefficient, T 4 and T 5 are brightness temperatures as derived from channels 4 and 5 and is zenith angle  4.2 TSS Model  A physical model relating radi ance from the water column and the concentrations of the water quality constituents provide the most effective way of analysing remotely sensed data for water quality studies. Reflectance is particularly dependent on inherent optical properties: the absorption coefficient and the backscattering coefficient The irradiance reflectance just below the water surface R 002   backscattering coefficient a w  i 002   absorption coefficient a p   chlorophyll specific absorption coefficient C  chlorophyll concentration  Chlorophyll concentration can be obtained by solving Equation \(3\o Equation \(4\hat is given as   165.0165.0 33.0 165.0  1   002 002 R b a b b b Ra C bw C bw bC bw w  212 212   4  We have to know two parameters \(the backscattering and absorption coefficients solve Equation 7. But these parameters were not available from this study area. So we used regression technique to solve the equation. From Equation 4, we can simplify the regression model as shown by Equation 5 for chlorophyll  002 s given by other study as  R 002   002   002 2  where 002 the spectral wavelength b  = the backscattering coefficient a  = the absorption coefficient The inherent optical properties are determined by the contents of the water. The contributions of the individual components to the overall properties are strictly additive [6 For a case involving wa ter quality component chlorophyll, C, the equation given by other studi  can be expressed as   1    1   1    1 5.0 33.0 1  1 R Ca w a C bc b bw b R c 002\002 002 002 002    3  where b bw  i

The satellite NOAA AVHRR the South China sea and the Straits of Malacca in this study was captured on 29/06/2004, 30/06/2004 03/07/2004, 04/07/2004, 05/07/2004, 08/07/2004 13/07/2004 and 16/7/2004. Cloud free seawater pixels for bands 10, 11 and 12 were extracted for SST retrieval. The DN values were converted into radiance values and later brightness temperatures values using PCI Geomatica AVHRR Radiometric Correction and Calibration. An automatic geocoding technique from PCI Geomatica 9.1.8 AVHRR Automated Geometric Correction was applied in this study to geocode the SST maps. Finally, the SST maps were colour-coded for visual interpretation.

NOAA AVHRR satellite data set \(channel 1 and channel 2\ected corresponding to the ground truth measurements of the pollution levels during ROSES\222s project. The satellite NOAA AVHRR data used in SST analysis was used for water quality mapping. The DN values were converted into radiance values and later reflectance values - AVHRR Ra diometric Correction and Calibration. The reflectance values corresponding to the ground truth sample locations were extracted from all the images. In this study, the multi-date data were corrected to minimize the difference in atmospheric effects between the scenes. The reflectance values for window size of 3 by 3 were used because the data set produced higher correlation coefficient and lower RMS value. The plot of the 002 002 Raa Ra C

The data points were then regressed to obtain all the coefficients of equation \(7 The proposed algorithm produ ced the highest accuracy between measured TSS and estimated TSS \(Figure 3 TSS map was then generated using the proposed algorithm An automatic geocoding technique - AVHRR Automated Geometric Correction was applied in this study to geocode the TSS maps. Finally, the TSS maps were colour-coded for visual interpretation   a    b  c\    \(d  e\  \(f  g\  \(h0   Legend for TSS   TSS < 20 mg/l  TSS = \(21-40\ mg/l  TSS = \(41- 60\ mg/l  TSS > 60 mg/l  Figure 4: TSS maps using the proposed algorithm a\06/2004, \(b\06/2004, \(c\07/2004 d\07/2004, \(e\07/2004, \(f\07/2004, \(g 13/07/2004 and \(h\7/2004  6 CONCLUSION  Environmental pollution can be determined using remote sensing techniques. NOAA AVH RR imagery can provide useful data for TSS and SST mapping of a bigger study area. The results of the study indicated that the performance of the developed algorithm is comparable to the established NOAA MCSST algorithm. The typical SST values in the studied region were between 24\260C to 32\260C. Coincident SST values are needed for more accu rate verification. This will be verified by pursuing further research. We have successfully utilized NOAA AVH RR satellite imagery for water pollution studies. The typical TSS values in the studied region were less than 60 mg/l. Without ground control point, it is possibl e to geocode the raw NOAA AVHRR images. Future studies on water pollutions are very much needed because the quality of water is required to be known every day 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We would like to thank the technical staff who participated in this project.

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
