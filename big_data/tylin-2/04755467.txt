  Enabling Distributed Model Management Using Semantic Web Technologies  Amit V. Deokar Dakota State University Madison, SD 57042 amit.deokar@dsu.edu Omar F. El-Gayar Dakota State University Madison, SD 57042 omar.el-gayar@dsu.edu   Abstract  In today s increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment, organizations strive to leverage their information resources to gain and sustain competitive advantage. Decision models as knowledge objects encapsulating problem situations, as well as means for leveraging information stored in corporate data warehouses, have positioned such models as an organizational resource that need to be managed, shared 
and re-used. Recent developments in distributed information technologies and the increasing reliance on such technologies by organization requires that model management accommodates today s distribute infrastructure landscape In this paper, we leverage recent developments in semantic web technologies to enable model management functions in a distributed and heterogeneous environment The proposed architecture leverages OWL to represent models at various levels of abstraction as well as pertinent problem domain, OWL-S to semantically annotate decision models represented as web services and SWRL to facilitate model querying. Model selection and composition are used to illustrate the applicability of the architecture to model management functions in a 
distributed setting   1. Introduction  Over the past decade, organizations have become increasingly focused on managing core competencies in order to gain better competitive advantage, leading to outsourcing of other related competencies. These globalization trends have created complex and dynamic work environments with exacerbated information management challenges. Organizational knowledge assets such as decision models and data need to be managed in a highly effective and efficient manner to predict key outcomes and performance indicators. Moreover, in 
today s digital world, organizations need to meet the additional challenges of conducting business electronically, while productively managing both inter and intra-organizational resources. Together, the demands of operating in distributed work environments, virtually collaborating with employees and partner organizations have underscored the need for research on distributed decision support technologies These technologies play an important role in enabling the decision-makers by allowing them to focus on making decisions rather than being heavily involved in gathering data, and conceiving 
and selecting analytical decision models Distributed model management systems \(DMMS\ are a particular class of distributed decision support systems with the focus on managing decision models throughout the modeling lifecy odels are es s e n tiall y codi f i ed  problem formulations, amenable to problem solving techniques such as linear programming or simple linear regression. Model instances represent specific decision making situations created by instantiating model schemas with appropriate data, and are amenable to computational execution using model solvers to determine model solutions. In certain cases, one or more solutions may 
exist, while many other cases, there may not be a feasible solution to the decision problem at hand. Examples of such models include demand forecasting in a customer service center, production planning to decide optimal product quantities to manufacture, transportation model to deliver the products to the clients under the constraints of time and cost Given that model sharing and reuse is one of the primary goals of model management \(MM\vities, it is important to develop a model management framework supporting common underlying semantics for model representation and reasoning. Additionally, developing 
new or adopting existing standards is a key to widespread adoption of such a framework in industry. From a computational perspective, Web services have emerged over the past decade as a standards-based mechanism to describe, encode, publish, retrieve, and compose computational entities such as decision models  a model representation perspective, markup languages like Structured Modeling Markup Language \(SMML\ [4  have been recently proposed to facilitate common structural agreement and representation of models. Most recently, semantic web technologies such as ontologies 
and associated reasoning tools and techniques have seen a variety of applications in providing enriched semantics to knowledge objects. Decision models as knowledge objects are a prime candidate for application of such techniques In this paper, we focus on enabling distributed model management through the use of semantic web Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


  technologies. The proposed architecture emphasizes the applicability of different semantic web techniques for different model management activities The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Sections 2 and 3 provide background on distributed model management and relevant semantic web technologies respectively. Section 4 describes semantic representation of models and services based on ontologies. Section 5 presents the proposed architecture, followed by example application scenarios in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the articles with a summary discussion  2. Distributed Model Management  Model management has its roots in management science and operations research domains. Since 1980 research in this area has been ongoing to support different model management functionalities including model representation, model manipulation, model selection model composition, solution computation, result information display and analysis. A comprehensive review of these functionalities can be found in   As noted earlier, with increased globalization distributed model management has drawn attention from IS researchers beginning mid-1990s. Some of the approaches leveraging distributed computing advances are noted below. Bhargava ed a w e b based architecture for sharing decision models prototyped as DecisionNet application. The main idea is that of sharing models by publishing and retrieving them through a centralized registry mechanism, similar to yellow pages, by model providers and consumers. Dolk  rop os ed a data w a reh o u s e bas e d app roach f o r m odel  storage. It utilizes the structured modeling approach proposed by Geoffrion c ri bi n g  m odel s Huh and Kim [10, 11 prop os ed a f r a m e w ork f o r dis t ribu ted  collaborative model management, emphasizing coordination and propagation of changes in a model base in real-time Models as loosely coupled components delivering specific functionality can be conceptualized as a service Likewise, a service as an entity abstracting underlying logic can be considered as a model. A duality between models and services has been noted by Deokar and ElGaya i t h res p ect to re u s e, abs t raction  au to n o m y   loose coupling, statelessness, composability, and discoverability. This analogy and duality between models and services indicates a potential for significant synergistic development between model management and service-oriented technologies [1  a s no t e d b y so m e o f  the following recent advances. Iy tl y  proposed a web services architecture for model sharing and reuse of spreadsheet models, while Ezechukwu et al  rop os ed an arch itec t u r e f o r su pportin g di s t ribu ted  optimization over the Internet. Madhusudan presented a framework for distributed model management based on web services. The framework utilizes the integrated Service Planning and Execution \(ISP&E for composing web services. Recently, Deokar and ElGaya e n t ed a s e m a ntic w e b s e r v ices bas e d  architecture for model management systems The proposed architecture builds on this past research The two novel characteristics of this architecture include 1\ly distributed nature of the architecture, where models as well as different model management functionalities are provided as services, \(2\ancing model and service descriptions with semantic web technologies. The former characteristic relieves the decision maker of performing computationally expensive operations by merely invoking them through a thin client interface. The later characteristic allows reasoning about models in an intelligent manner to support the goals of model sharing and reuse  3. Semantic Web Technologies  3.1 Knowledge representation and ontologies Decision models are knowledge objects that capture valuable organizational know-how at operational, tactical and strategic levels. In order to create computer supported environments such as intelligent decision support systems that encapsulate these models to solve business problems it is imperative that their representation schemes promote computational reasoning capab ilities. In this respect, the notion of Knowledge Representation \(KR\vant in the context of model representation. KR has a long historical background in Artificial Intelligence \(AI research, where the focus has been on structuring and encoding knowledge in different forms, used in conjunction with inference procedures, for the development of intelligent systems ccording to  Davis, Shrobe and Szolovits  [19 KR p l a y s m u ltip le  roles, in that it is a surrogate, a set of ontological commitments, a fragmented theory of intelligent reasoning, a medium for efficient computation, and a medium of human expression Ontologies provide a conceptualization mechanism or a vocabulary to represent knowledge in a given domain and are sometimes referred to as content theories  The concept of ontologies has been widely studied and definitions from different perspectives abound. More recently, the notion of ontologies has been referred by the Semantic Web community members as a set of knowledge terms, including the vocabulary, the semantic interconnections, and some simple rules of inference and logic for some particular topic  A n ot h e r relev a nt  definition provided by Studer, Benjamins and Fens suggests ontologies as a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization Researchers have also proposed various categorizations for ontologies. For instance, Guarin tin gu i s h e s bet w een top lev e l  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


  ontologies, domain ontologies, task ontologies, and application ontologies It is important to note that the major goal of ontologies is not merely to serve as taxonomies or vocabularies, but that of knowledge sharing and reuse by applications and systems. Neches, Fikes, Finin, Gruber, Senator and Swartout n t out  many  m odes of  kn o w l e dg e  sharing and reuse enabled by ontologies including exchange of techniques, inclusion of source specifications at design-time\-time invocation of external modules or services, and interoperability between systems through communication. These modes of sharing and reuse also apply in the context of model management Ontological engineering has grown as a subarea within knowledge engineering that concerns with ontology development and use throughout the ontology life cycle  design, implementation, validation, deployment maintenance, mapping, sharing, and reuse [25   Ontology representation languages play a key role in ontological engineering by providing a means to build ontologies based on specific KR paradigms to formally represent different knowledge modeling components such as concepts, and roles\tology representation languages such as KIF [26 an d On to lin g u a   e re bas e d on KR  tec h n i q u es  s u c h as  f i rstorder logic and frame-based representation  3.2 Relevant semantic Web standards Recently, XML-based ontology representation languages, also called as ontology markup languages have emerged to support ontology representation in the context of the Semantic Web [28 e s o u r ce Des c ription Framework \(RDF\ a W3C \(World Wide Web Consortium\ recommendation developed for describing Web resources with metadata and incorporates a data model based on the semantic-network KR paradigm RDF Schema \(RDFS\ is an extension of RDF with framebased primitives for defining the relationships between properties and resources, and is also a W3C Recommendation tology Inf eren ce L a y e r \(OIL   based on the Description Logics \(DL\ KR paradigm is an extension of RDF/RDFS adding more frame-based representation primitives and eluding the RDF reification mechanism M L OI L al s o bas e d on  DL K R  paradigm an ev ol u t i o n of t h e earlier D A R P A Agent Markup Language \(DAML\mpting to combine the expressiveness of DAML and OIL by providing DL extensions of RDF/RDFS directly  Web Ontology Language \(OWL\ved from the DAML+OIL language, is a W3C recommendation and is the current standard ontology markup language for the Seman It is ex tre m el y ric h f o r des c ribing relationships among class, properties, and individuals. Its vocabulary includes support for property type restrictions equality, property characteristics, class intersection, and restricted cardinality. Additionally, OWL is not a closed language; it is instead a combination of three sublanguages with increasing expressiveness, namely OWL-Lite, OWL-DL, and OWL-Full, to support varying needs of knowledge engineers. Recently, Semantic Web Rule Language \(SWRL h a s been propos ed by W3C as a rule language that can be used to write rules in terms of OWL concepts and can reason about OWL individuals With powerful features like built-ins, which are userdefined predicates, a number of libraries can be custom built \(in addition to the core built-ins\or various tasks such as unit or currency conversion, taxonomy queries and so forth. One such built-in library is the Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language \(SQWRL\ in order to support querying of OWL ontologies. SQWRL can be used to build retrieval specifications for knowledge extraction from OWL ontologies Web services as executable versions of models are a key component of our architecture as discussed in Section 5. Currently, web services are described procedurally using the Web Services Description Language \(WSDL which lack semantic descriptions of web services. Several approaches have been proposed to adding semantics to web service descriptions. Submissions to th e W3C consortium exemplify these approaches: OWL Web Ontology Language for Services \(OWL-S\ervices Modeling Ontology \(WSMO\mantic Web Services Framework \(SWSF\, and Web Service Semantics WSDL-S\se OWL-S, as discussed in Section 4.2 given its process-oriented nature amenable to functionalities such as model composition  4. Semantic Model / Service Representation  4.1 Semantic representation of models Ontologies can be used to develop semantically rich models that can support intelligent reasoning and querying based on not only syntactic information, but also semantic information. These reasoning capabilities provide the necessary technological support needed to discover, interpret, compose, and execute models Moreover, the use of ontologies facilitates the capture of model semantics that is independent of a particular tool or application As shown in Figure 1, the different abstraction levels for model representation, as discussed below serve as one dimension. Along an orthogonal dimension are the different domains. A number of domains may also be relevant in the context of a particular problem domain For example, a transportation model may be primarily formulated for the supply chain domain. The supply chain domain ontology may consist of key terms such as supplier, demand and customer. Other domain ontologies can provide additional semantics to the model structure For example, currency ontology as mentioned in the discussion above may be used to provide semantics to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


  cost variables. Another units ontology may provide semantics associated with units such as tons. Thus, in a nutshell, the problem domain ontology along with other auxiliary domain ontologies together forms a library of relevant ontologies to provide semantics to the models   Figure 1. Model Representation Abstractions  Model representation can be viewed at three levels of abstraction. Level 1 indicates the highest level of abstraction, where the goal of representation is to denote a particular modeling paradigm in terms of its fundamental constructs and relationships among them. The overall notion is similar to meta-modeling that gives information about the feasible structure of a particular model schema or instance. We have focused on using Structured Modeling \(SM th e m o del repres e n t ation paradigm   Thus, model representation at level 1 provides the concepts and relationships that be used to represent both the model schemas and model instances, from a structural viewpoint. We have built two ontologies using OWL to capture the concepts and relationships in SM for representing model schemas and model instances respectively \(refer Figure 2 The next lower level of abstraction is level 2, where the goal is to represent a particular model schema independent of its data, such that various sets of data values may be used to instantiate this model at the lowest level of abstraction, i.e. at level 3. For example, an optimization model for a transportation problem in the supply chain domain may be represented in a dataindependent manner at level 2. Level 2 essentially is an instantiation of level 1 model schema structure ontology in the context of the domain knowledge. This implies linking it with classes in the problem domain ontologies such as supply chain ontology or other relevant ontologies such as currency \(for cost variables\. Thus level 2 captures semantics, both in terms of the model structure and problem domain semantics. This provides meaningful information that can be queried and extracted for various model management functions such as model selection and model composition, as discussed in Section 6   Figure 2.

It is essentially an instantiation of level 1 model instance structure ontology in the context of a particular model schema and a data set. For example, an optimization model for a transportation problem in the supply chain domain may be instantiated with a particular data set where the parameter values needed to solve the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


  problem are clearly provided. Model solvers can then use this model instance to provide results for the transformation problem for the given data set  4.2. Semantic representation of services We use OWL-S  33 f o r p r o v id in g se m a n tics to  models, encapsulated as executable web services in the proposed architecture. OWL-S is an OWL-based Web Service Ontology language, whose objective is to provide a vocabulary for encoding rich semantic web service descriptions. Service descriptions may be provided using OWL-S that mainly consists of three interrelated subontologies for the top-level concept Service, namely ServiceProfile, ServiceModel, and ServiceGrounding The service model \(relevant in the context of MM provides essentially a process model specification to describe how the service works in other words, how the client may interact with the service\in the form of Inputs Outputs, Preconditions, and Results \(typically called IOPR model\, which may be used for service seeking composing service descriptions, coordinating and monitoring of service executions. The Result concept allows a mechanism to specify several mutually exclusive results with corresponding outputs and possible effects using the inCondition, withOutput, and hasEffect properties\ process can be one of the three types atomic \(single interaction\, composite \(combination of processes with some workflow control structure\, or simple \(service abstraction The IOPR model can be specified in any appropriate representation language. We have chosen to use SWRL as the representation of choice, given the amenability of this rule-based representation for sequential composition of services T h e P r econ d ition s i n Co n d itions an d  Effects are represented using logical formulae in SWRL expressed over the Input and Output, which are essentially SWRL variables. The Parameter class is an intermediate class between these concepts, and is associated with a hasParameterType property. While the parameter type may be either a class or an XML schema datatype, in order to provide semantically richer descriptions of models \(e.g., a GenusName concept is much richer than, say, a string datatype\we take the stance of declaring Inputs and Outputs as concepts from the problem domain ontology or any other relevant ontology. Thus, the conditions expressed in terms of inputs and outputs will also be expressed will also be in terms of the relevant domain ontologies, and as a result have appropriate representation level \(as discussed in Section 4.1 In order to ensure decidability, we restrict the SWRL rules to be DL-Saf allo w i ng th e SW R L ru le to  bind only to known individuals in an ontology. This check is performed by the rule engine, thus assuring that the services selected based on this reasoning can indeed be executed. Certain other guidelines required for ease of reasoning are mentioned in   5. Proposed Model Management Architecture  Figure 3 shows the proposed model management architecture based on semantic web technologies. At the core of the architecture is the semantic representation of models/services. Executable models are denoted as model web services, which are described semantically using OWL-S and SWRL, as discussed in Section 4.2 Additionally, models may also be represented using either markup languages such as SMML e r f o rm at s such as GAMS, LINGO or MATLAB, which can be semantically represented in the form of structured model ontology, as discussed in Section 4.1. These semantic representations of models or services use the terminology from relevant domain knowledge ontologies Representative model preprocessing and execution services are shown on the right side of Figure 3, with which the user may interact through a front end. In turn these services leverage semantic processing services such as semantic web rule service and ontology reasoning service. UML component symbol is used to identify executable services. The arrows denote service requests and not the information exchange occurring. Now, we discuss the interactions among various components of the architecture In cases where models exist in SMML format, the ontology mapper service a y be i n v o k e d t o  convert the XML representation to a semantic representation based on the SM ontology. In cases where models exist in other formats such as GAMS, the model translator service may be invoked to translate the model into an SMML format, which in turn can be mapped to the SM ontology using the ontology mapper service SMML models may be queried directly using mechanisms such as XQuery, while the ontology representations can may be queried using SQWRL \(refer Section 6.1\ to provide semantically richer results. In cases where only executable models in the form of web services exist, the modeler may annotate them using the semantic annotation service to conduct further reasoning Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Since explicit structural information will be missing from their representations only limited reasoning about such models may be done e.g., querying based on structural information may not be done\ch selection of relevant models is done by the model selection service using the semantic processing services. The ontology reasoning service reasons about the OWL ontologies to create inferences such as subsumption based on description logic. Ontology reasoners such as Pe a r e u s ed f o r th is s e rv ice. T h e  semantic web rule service is a rule engine \(e.g., Bossam  at reas on s bas e d o n t h e S W RL ru le s  T h e m odel  execution services are discussed as application scenarios in Section 6 In a nutshell, the proposed architecture leverages semantic representations of models and their execution counterparts, i.e., model web services along with reasoning services to support model management functionalities  6. Example Application Scenarios  In the discussion below, two types of potential application scenarios are presented to illustrate the ideas discussed earlier. Each of these scenarios have been prototypically tested for feasibility  6.1. Model selection Decision makers often need to select an appropriate model for the task at hand based on a number of factors such as the model-task compatibility, data requirements for candidate models, and last but not least execution behavior of candidate models. Here, we draw our attention to model-task compatibility, which can be judged by decision makers based on the results obtained by querying a semantic model base for relevant concepts The model ontology repository consists of structured model ontologies \(transformed from SMML\d also the corresponding service descriptions of those models. The structured model ontologies in turn refer to particular Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


  domain ontologies. For example, a demand forecasting model in a production environment will refer to terminology using one or more manufacturing domain ontologies. SQWRL queries written in terms of the structured model ontology terms can enable semantic querying of models Shown below is a sample query using SQWRL  Genus\(?g g, ?l sqwrl:select\(?g,?l  This query will return pairs of genera and their structured model levels. The sqwrl prefix is used to denote SQWRL operators. Implicit in this query is the information that the genus could belong to any one of the finer genus types primitive, compound, attribute, function, and test represented as subclasses of the class genus. Semantic querying of a model base thus allows one to obtain information without knowing the detailed syntactic structure of the model base. In other words, semantic queries support retrieval of both explicit and implicit information based on syntactic and semantic information in a knowledge base. The declarative approach allows user to specify what information is needed without posing the burden of knowing how the information is actually represented. These declarative SQWRL queries can then be reasoned using rule engines such as Jess or Bossom, to find the result of the query. This is supported by the semantic web rule service in the proposed architecture  6.2. Model composition Model composition is the problem of generating a sequence of models from a library of available models in response to a particular decision-making situation. Model composition focuses on assembling models together at a functional level [16, 41 rath er th an at a stru ct u r al  level. Only few research proposals attempt to address model composition in distributed settings [7, 48 Using the semantic description of web services in terms of OWL-S and SWRL-based IOPR model \(refer Section 4.2\ the knowledge base and a model composition request specified as a SWRL atom, the composer service invokes the semantic web rule service to find if a feasible SWRL rule path exists, and generating all possible such paths. The semantic web rule service is essentially a forward rule chaining rule engine, Bossam  h ic h reas ons bas e d on th e S W RL D L S a f e rules It  can be noted that besides the horn clause based rule base the inference is also based on the relevant description logic-based domain ontologies. This type of composition is suitable for models in which the process model consists of only atomic processes Alternatively, the composition service may be based on Hierarchical Task Network \(HTN\ning techniques as discusse h is com pos i tion ca n be m o re  amenable to OWL-S composite services involving various workflow control constructs e v e r, in t h is case   an intermediate task of transforming the SWRL rules in OWL-S IOPE models to SHOP2 planner amenable operators and methods needs to be performed  7. Discussion and concluding remarks  Analogous to data, this paper acknowledges decision models as an organizational resource that need to be managed, shared and reused. Distributed and heterogeneous information technology infrastructure imposes specific challenges that must be addressed in unique and novel ways. In that regard, the paper proposes an architecture that enables model management function in a distributed setting. The architecture is unique with respect to: \(1\ is truly distributed in the sense that model repositories as well as model management functions are distributed. \(2\plicitly leverages semantic web technologies such as OWL, OWL-S, and SWRL to facilitate model management function such as model selection and model composition The complexity of the technical landscape and the diversity of modeling paradigms represent significant challenges and opportunities for extending this research For example, much of the research in ontological engineering comes to bear in the context of model management. Of specific relevance is ontology development and ontology integration for desperate models. Other areas include the role of SWRL in ontology query as well as composition. The latter may include comparing and contrasting SWRL to other composition approaches such as HTN planning techniques as well as exploring areas of complementarities. Moreover, the suitability of the proposed approach to various types of models is something to consider. While structured modeling provided an underlying conceptual foundation for representing the details of mathematical models structured modeling has its limitations and may not be suitable for all types of models. Last but not least, the complexity of developing ontology-based representation of models will need to be further explored if this research is to transition to practice  8. References  1 E.

 10 However, the method proposed in this paper is able to improve the tracking performance. In roll, yaw and pitch axes, the attitude commands of aircraft have rapid and precise responses. Besides, usi ng in-flight C.G. estimation the approach can be seen to quickly adapt to the changing dynamics of the aircraft, a nd the coupling influence among three axes is effectively restrained In conclusion, the proposed de sign method in this paper could provide consistent pe rformance under varying C.G locations. Furthermore, compared with the conventional gain-scheduling method which requires huge design workload, this approach would effectively reduce the design complexity and make the design process clear and easy to implement 5  C ONCLUSION  This paper focuses on mode ling and attitude control of aircraft with C.G. variations First, a 6-DoF flight dynamics model of aircraft with C.G. vari ations is derived in order to account for the effect of the C.G. offset. After that, a synthesis approach based on i n-flight estimation of C.G position and inverse dynami cs is proposed to provide consistent performance under va rying C.G. locations. The simulation results demons trate good control performance and effectiveness of this approach A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research work is supported by the China Aviation Science Fund program \221Integrate d Vehicle Management System Concept and Architecture Research for Advanced Aircraft\222 \(No.20060718001 R EFERENCES  1] AGARD, \223Integrated Vehi cle Management Systems,\224 North Atlantic Treaty Organization REPORT 343, 1996  Watson M  D. and Johnson S.B 223A Theory of Vehicle Management Systems,\224 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, March 3-10, 2007   A.Hay r e and T.Dull, \223The ATF YF-23 Vehicle Management System,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  B.Hill and R.W a tts, \223Suit Study\227The Im pact of VMS in Subsystem Integration,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  Huber B  223C enter of Gravity C ontrol on Airbus Aircraft Fuel, Range and Loading,\224 The 47th Annual Conference  of the Society of Allied Weight Engineers, Plymouth Michigan, May 23-25, 1988   Nhan Nguy en etc, \223Dy n am ics and Adaptive C ontrol for Stability Recovery of Damage d Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Guidance, Navigation a nd Control Conference and Exhibit, Keystone, Colorado, 2006   Ostroff A J and B acon B J, \223Force and M o m e nt Approach for Achievable Dynamics Using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Portland, OR, 1999  Liu Jiarun and Shen Gongz hang, \223Attitude Control Based on Inverse Dynamics and Online Parameter Identification,\224 Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics 31\(2  Wu Sentang and Fei Yuhua Flight Control System Beijing: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Press, 2005  R obert C  Nelson and Gu Junxiao\(translator Stability and Automatic C ontrol, Beijing: National Defense Industry Press, 2008   B a rton J.B acon and Irene M  Gregory 223General Equations of Motion for a Damaged Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Atmosphe ric Flight Mechanics Conference and Exhibit, Hilton Head, Carolina, 2007  o she Idan, Gil Iosilevskii and Sergey Nazarov 223InFlight Weight and Balance Identification Using Neural Networks,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Austin, Texas, 2003  Li Yuany u an and Zhang Lifeng, \223Application of Adaptive Weighted Fusion Algorithm of Multi-sensor Data,\224 Automation & Instrumentation 2, 10-13, 2008  Aircraft Design M a nual Beijing: Aviation Industry Press, 2005  M a them atics M a nual, B e iji ng: Higher Education Press 2002 B IOGRAPHY  Jing Zhang is a PhD student in the Department of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
