 1 Method of Combine Orbit Determination and Its Application in Space Based Technology  Pan Xiaogang Zhou Haiyin School of Science, National University of Defense Technology Yanwachi Zhengjie Street, No.47, Changsha, Hunan 410073 86-07314573260 panxiaogang@tom.com  Abstract 227Space Based technology is the tendency of new technology of space surveilla nce since the Space-Based Visible \(SBV ccess within its experiment mission. With advantages of covering rate and multi-goals exploring capability, the Space Based technology had been applied to many fields such as LEO satellite determination based on GPS, midcourse ballistic missile tracking and so 
on, the main challenge for space based observation is errors of platform which can badly contaminate the observation data. In space, the SBV platfo rm will be shaken with high frequency error and the axes will be circumvolved with low frequency, so the observation data contains not only stochastic errors data but also system errors data with different frequency. How to de scribe the system error and improve the orbit determination of spacecraft based on space based observation data is the goal of this paper Combine orbit determination method is to deal with the SBV satellite orbit and space object satellite orbit synchronously, so the system error of SBV will be restrained. Batch orbit determination method and combine orbit determination algorithm were involved in the paper 
By generating a new strategy to analyz the residuals of orbit determination, it is designed to produce the near true environment observation error model, and to compensate in calculation. Thus, semi-parametric non linear model was introduced in this paper, which can distinctly describe the LEO satellite observation model and dynamic model based on Space Based Surveillance System, and a nonparametric estimator was proposed to solve the semi-parametric non linear model, finally the Fourier Transform Method for non-parametric parts was applied to decompose the different system signals in orbit to distinguish the dynamic error model and the observation error model or satellite platform error of space based satellite

1  I NTRODUCTION  The Space\226Based Visible sensor had been launched on the Midcourse Space Experiment satellite for more than ten years, and is still operated in space surveillance because of its superiority on quality of deep-space object catalog maintaining and abundant adva ntage of cover rate and multi-goals capability compar ed with ground observation model  The SBV had completed its original mission of demonstrating the efficacy of using the SBV for space surveillance, and join in the operational Space-Based Space Surveillance. SBV proved that the space based observation model can improve the capability of searching space objects 3 
because the optical camera will not be easily disturbed by atmosphere, the image de-noise process became comparatively easily, on the condition of phase angle of goal and sun line meeting lower than threshold value, the observation data can be obtained. The main error of observation error includes system error caused by platform attitude state error. In space, the satellite attitude will be changed by sun radiation disturbed force , control force, etc., which results in platform circumrotating and wobbling and shaking, and finally results in observation system and stochastic error data. How to restrain pollution by the platform error is the goal of this paper The perturbation of satellite in the space cannot be modeled very exactly because of the unknown space environment especially for the LEO satellite. The atmosphere density 
model is very difficult to describe. And because the characteristic of objects in th e space such as their area and quality is unknown too, the radi ation pressure model and atmosphere drag model contain many low precise parameters, so the dynamic model error is not avoid in the orbit determination. Many scholars had been studying effective methods for restraining the dynamic error  The main strategy was Reduced-dynamic orbit determination  which add the process noise to the dynamic model in orbit to absorb the influence of model error. Reduced-dynamic orbit determination method needs 


 2 rigorous condition of observation data, or a very precise kinematic orbit of the object, which is not suitable for surveillance of non cooperative obj ect. The intention of this paper is try to create a compensation model of the dynamic model 2  O BSERVATION MODEL OF SPACE BASED VISIBLE  The space based satellite usually carries two kinds of sensor, one is capturing camera with width field of vision and low precision used to detect objects, and the other is tracking camera with narrow field of vision and high precision used to tracke the objects 2.1 Capturing Mode of SBV  Three modes can be adapted to the observation model of space based optical camera. i.e optical barrier and fixed airspace and geosynchronous belts 1\ical barrier Because all the satellite will pa ss through a plane with earth core, it can be surveillanced by SBV, if some SBV launched on one orbit with diffe rent true anomaly and form an optical barrier. The sketch map is as follows   Fig.1 Sketch map of optical barrier mode In this observation mode, every SBV scans ahead the region when the satellite moving ahead. It can be imaged if the objects satisfy the condition of imaging \(responding range, background light and platform angles 2   Fig.2 Sketch map of fixed airspace mode In this observation mode, the SBV stare at the fixed space through oriented toward one star set by ground station When the object passes through the area, a beam line will be shaped in the CCD[see fi so t h e observat i on dat a  can be got 3\chronous belts   Fig.3 Sketch map of geosynchronous belts mode Geosynchronous belts mode is designed to supervise the deep space objects, and to catalog the GEO satellite 2.2 Tracking Mode of SBV Once the objects were captured by SBV, the tracking program can be carried out automatically with closed loop mode by the tracking optical sensor. In the closed loop mode, the phase angle\(see in th e figure4\e vital factor for imaging  because the photometric condition is the main challenge for SBV. The observed region of space object can be restricted with the following conditions 1\ is not in the shadow of Earth 2 3\e should be smaller than 100 degree 4 In space, the background of the object is correspondingly simply towards to ground base, So the random factor is not dominant, while the calibration process is very difficult, the rather that attitude of SBV is not firmly changeless because of the control of satellite. Thus, the system error will be the dominating parts in the observation data error Pinch point Geosychronou visual angle of SBV  Surveillant area  Space based satellite orbit visual angle of SBV

In traditional LSE orbit improvement, the OC residuals contains not only space object dynamic error observation system error, SB V platform error and SBV satellite ephemeris error. To decompose the OC residual error and distinguish the above errors is a perfect idea, but it is very difficult if the frequencies of the errors are the same. As we know that ephemeri s error is difficult to affirm so we design the combine orbit determination to eliminate it 4  C OMBINE ORBIT DIFFERENTIAL CORRECTION  Combine orbit improvement is a parallel process to calculate the space object orbit and the SBV satellite orbit It can be concluded from the above discussion that the ephemeris error of SBV satellite will badly influence the precision of orbit determinati on of space objects, and model compensation improvement is an effective method to restrain the platform error. Ho wever, if the characteristic of all the error are the same, it is difficult to distinguish the dynamic error and ephemeris error of SBV. Thus, combine improvement is the best way to eliminate the ephemeris system error first. And then, the other model errors can be easily distinguished through OC residual analysis In combine orbit determination mode, suppose that the total number of ground station is m and the number of space based satellite is n see figure 6  Fig.6 Combine orbit determination sketch map The combine observation model is as the following  005\005  Then the combine orbit determination with the same form can be described as the following  327    g Brst t 006 006 006 006  Let   00 1,1 1,2 1 1        pn rR B rR BB B rR  212\006    T 001 0  n rR R 005      T    aei M  1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 3 2 210 sin 210 rr n B t aa a BHrKr z BR i B BRr r B n       T    iii i i i aei M      00  00  00   00 00 00   ii nn rr ri i rn n RR RR G HG r R Rtt st t rR  1 TT rBWBBh 002\004 t t\t 002\004 327    00  00  00   00 00 00   ii nn ri i rn n rr RR RR g HG r R Rtt G B rR t\n 013 is the ephemeris of space object 013 212 006  12  003    005 007\007 007  006  005\005 Where    003 b\006   13  Thus, the 005  005  Where n 006 013 is the ephemeris of SBV satellite  005\005 005\006     s t will just contain dynamic model error and observation error. Because of special frequency of these errors, it is easy to distinguish them 4.1 Method to Weight on Diffe rent Observation Model So many ground station and sp ace based SBV, the precision of these observation data is different, so how to correctly weight them is important to improve the estimation results A traditional method is variance component estimation   We will apply this method in combine orbit determination But we add the factor to it discussed following Take the matrix B into account

By analyzing the OC residual error the position error caused by dynamic model error can be estimated, and the dynamic model error or the perturbation force model error can be got by differentialing it. Thus add this force model estimated to the state function again, then the precision of model can be improved. As a result, the sample data OC residual error/ arc sec 0 0 0 0   tradtional OCresidual 30 Radial Along Track   Fig.15 SBV satellite1 orbit determination results of combine method with compensation  Radial Along Track   Fig.16 SBV satellite2 orbit determination results of combine method with compensation  Radial Along Track   Fig.17 LEO satellite orbit determination results of combine method with compensation   40 80 50 0 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 20 10 20 30 40 50 


 9 compensation method can restrain the dynamic model error so the precision of orbit determination for LEO and SBV can get improved together 6  C ONCLUSION  The space based observation technology will be predominant in the next gene ration of space surveillance although it has been successful through MSX satellite, there still many key technoogies to be solved, such as the system error of space based satellite platform, the dynamic model error of the space object, the r eal time tracking method, the debris\222s auto identif iability and so on. This paper proposed an operational method of solving the above question with combine orbit determination based on compensation method. Combine orbit determination task is a very colossal project requiring very pivotal and basic technology, so, the work in the paper is just a small part of it.

Real-time Implementation and Demonstration The authors have developed a software Graphical User Interface GUI to enable real-time implementation of the PHM analysis techniques described in this paper A screenshot of this GUI is shown in Figure 18 Figure 18 Screenshot of real-time implementation interface The interface allows the user to control the flow temperature and pressure setpoints to the setup The user may choose to view the feedback signals from the setup or as shown in Figure 18 to observe the results of the PHM analysis These PHM results are computed on-the-fly using real-time sensor data from the setup The interface allows the seeding of software faults such as gear and valve faults into the setup The PHM results shown in the figure include health indices and mean times to failure and confidences thereof for the pump and valve as well as the actual and model-predicted flow pressure and RPM signals The parameters obtained from the model-based analysis are also displayed along with the baseline values of these parameters In addition the interface has indicators to alert the user to certain critical faults in the setup such as gear damage and cavitation which might require immediate shutdown and maintenance on the setup 5 CONCLUSIONS Gas turbine engine accessory components such as pumps valves and actuators create a majority of the maintenance issues in aircraft gas turbine systems A combination of model-based and data-driven approaches was implemented to address the problem of predicting and forecasting the health of these accessory components Experimental data were collected on a test setup representative of aircraft fuel and lubrication systems and these data were used to train a developed model of the system as well as data-driven routines The model-based routines yielded features that uniquely correlated to pump and valve faults The datadriven routines yielded a feature which picked out pump cavitation There was a one-to-one correspondence between the developed features and the faults indicated by these features The routines were validated with additional experimental data from the FSTB setup The authors have also developed evolutionary prognostics routines based on the DXS algorithm for the purpose of trending and tracking the progress of fault features in feature space In addition a demonstration interface was developed to enable real-time implementation of the developed techniques These techniques constitute a significant initial step towards addressing the issue of on-board diagnostics and prognostics for gas turbine accessory components 6 FUTURE WORK Work will continue to streamline the developed PHM routines and to develop data fusion routines to merge the results of model-based and data-driven algorithms The applicability of the developed PHM algorithms may be extended to a variety of gas turbine engine fluid systems such as engine compressor and nozzle systems starting systems and Auxiliary Power Units APUs and fuel and lube systems Engine fluid system reliability data may be included to improve the fidelity of the PHM algorithms in predicting impending failures and Remaining Useful Life RUL given current health status and envisioned use In addition dedicated PHM system prototypes may be developed for fuel and lubrication system health assessment and these prototypes may be tested on OEM test cells 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work has significantly benefited from the invaluable support and technical input from the Wright Patterson Air Force Base The authors would also like to acknowledge financial support for this work provided through the Air Force Small Business Innovative Research SBIR program In addition we would like to recognize the contributions of our colleague Matthew Smith 8 REFERENCES 1 DUSD\(LMR CBM+Memorandum November 2002 Available at Defense Acquisition Guidebook 2 Department of Defense Web site DoD Instruction 5.2 3.,9,2,,asp3.9.2 3 Pratt and Whitney Web site ht pr 4 J Rhoades JSF System Development and Demonstration CodeOne Magazine 17 2002 Available on-line at 11
