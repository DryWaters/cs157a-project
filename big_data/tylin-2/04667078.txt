How to make use of the rich knowledge in the Wiki is a big challenge. In this paper we propose a method to construct domain ontology from the Chinese Wiki automatically  The main idea in this paper is based on the entry segmenting and Feature Text \(FT\ extracting, where we segment the name of entries and establish the concept hierarchy firstly. Secondly, we extract the FTs from the descriptions of entries to eliminate the redundant information. Finally we calculate the similarity between pairs of FTs to revise the concept hierarchy and gain non-taxonomy relations between concepts. The primary experiment indicates that our method is useful for Chinese domain ontology construction   1. Introduction  Wikipedia \(Wiki\ is an environment where web users are able to share their knowledge about a certain topic [1   The Wiki includes many entries. Each entry has a corresponding web page-- description  Obviously, the knowledge offered by Wiki is loose arrangement, which lacks of well concept hierarchy structure and the logical inference mechanism. Therefore it makes computer systems difficult to deal with the content of Wiki in a semantic way. A potential solution is to use ontologies which are established based on Wiki There has been much research on the construction ontology from free text. The major automated methods are the pattern-based method [1 t h e s t a t i s t i c ba s e d  m e t h od  7   the dictionary based method [8  t h e c o r r e la tio n  r u le s b a s e d  method [9  a n d t h e  kn ow l e d g e  ba s e m e t h od 1 0    Constructing ontology from Wiki is different from constructing ontology from the free text. First, the entries in Wiki can be considered as concepts directly. Secondly, the contents of entries of Wiki are shorter with few words. It is difficult to extract the relations without other accessorial corpora. Thirdly, Wiki allows users to freely create and edit description content using any Web browser. Therefore there exists redundant data in Wiki’s content, which will disturb the forming of the hierarchy In this paper we propose a method to construct the Chinese domain ontologies from Wiki based on the entry segmenting and feature text \(FT\ extracting automatically The method does not need accessorial corpora. It extracts the FTs from the descriptions of entries to eliminate the redundant information The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the architecture for the .ontology construction Section 3 introduces the processing of automated ontology construction and the relative technology. Section 4 explains the experimental results on the wine ontology construction from baidu Wiki [4 F i n a l l y  s e c t i o n 5 dr a w s t h e  conclusion  2  The architecture of system  Figure 1 displays the architecture of our system to automated construct the Chinese domain ontology from Wiki according the feature of the Wiki  Ontology uses classes to represent concepts. It also supports taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations between classes. So, a common ontology learning system comprises three basic stages: the domain terminology extraction concept hierarchy arrangement, and the non-taxonomy relations discovering [5  Th e co n cep t  h i e r ar c h y

  arrangement is according the taxonomy relations    Figue1 the architecture of system to automated construct the Chinese domain ontology from Wiki  There are five steps to accomplish three basic stages in our system. They are Web page pre-processing, entry segmenting and concept clustering, feature text \(FT extracting, FTs similarity calculating, and property finding which are described below 1\Web page preprocessing Wiki offer some entries about the same topic. Each entry has a corresponding web page. These web pages have a similar structure, which has an entry and a description This step partitions Wiki web pages into entries and descriptions according the html tags and web page pattern The entries can be treated as the concepts directly 2\ Entry segmenting and concept clustering This step forms the concepts hierarchy using entries Chinese entry consists of terms 021 There is semantic information in the combinatorial sequence of these terms The system uses a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm: ES \(Entry Segment\ algorithm to segment and cluster the entries \(concepts\ at the same time. The ES algorithm maps entries to concepts in a hierarchy according the name compounding. The hierarchy is rough. Some entries are located in an error place 3\eature text \(FT\ extracting This step deals with descriptions which are generated by step1. In the description, several of information is mixed together. Only the Feature Text \(FT\, which embodies its dissimilarity with other entries, is needed. To eliminate the disturbed information, we extract the feature text from the description at first. The hierarchy generated by step2 is an assistant data in this step 4\ FTs similarity calculating The FT is a definition of an entry. It contains several sentences. Each sentence contains terms. The system uses the proportion of cooccurrence terms to calculate the similarity between FTs. If the similarity is 1, there is a sameas” relation between entries. If the similarity between FTs is larger than a threshold, they are sibling. The system locates the entry according its sibling’s location. This step revises the concept hierarchy   5\ Property finding  In the ontology, the sibling concepts are differentiated by the properties of concepts. Same property name and different property value form the classified rule. From a contrasting point of view, the system uses the hierarchy and FTs to find the property of concepts  3  Automated ontology construction  3.1 002  Entry segmenting and concept clustering  Chinese entry’s name consists of terms. There is semantic information in the combinatorial sequence of these terms. Most Chinese entry includes a subject term and several decoration terms. The subject term usually locate in the last portion of the entry. For example, an entry drywhiterwine 024F,Q:59ØG has a subject term alcohol G and three decoration terms : “dry 024F  white Q and “grape 59 It has a meaning: alcohol which has a dry taste, white color and brewed by grape There is no space between terms of Chinese entry name. So, the entry name must be segment at first. There are many tools for Chinese term segment. They are not fit for the specific domain. So, we design a name segment method, which is a byproduct of concepts clustering Because all the entries are talk about the same topic the subject term will appear time after time. So, we use a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm: ES \(Entry Segment\ algorithm to segment and cluster the entries concepts\ at the same time  ES algorithm Input All entries E=\(e 1 e 2 e n  Output classification tree F 1   for\( i=1; i<=n; i   c i e i f i e i add c i  as a leaf node in the tree F 2 for\( n=max\( len\(f i n>1;n 2 1: using formula \(4\to calculate the threshold t  2 2: for any cluster c i 2.2.1 for any cluster c j  using formula \(1\ calculate the similarity sim c i  c j  if  sim\(ci,cj\>t  c k  c i 001 c j  c j NULL;  f j NULL  2.2.2  c i NULL;  f i NULL f k is the n-1 right side sub string of f i add c k  as a node in the tree F 3: End 1\ Web pages preprocessing  2 002 entry segmenting and concepts clustering Descriptions 3 002 feature text \(FT extracting  FTs 5 002 property finding  Concepts hierarchy feedback 4 002 FTs similarity calculating  Non-taxonomy relations concepts entries Ontology Wiki web pages

  ES algorithm is an improved hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. At first, each entry is treated as a cluster f i which is a string, is the feature of the cluster c i Because the algorithm deals with the entries concepts\ name, the level of the hierarchy is less than the maximum length of entry name. The similarity between clusters is the measure of distance between clusters. Using formula \(1\ to calculate the similarity between the cluster c i  and the cluster  c j  000       min 1         j i e e k j i k j i f f W k c c sim 002  1 f i is the feature of the cluster c i  f j is the feature of the cluster c j  They are strings also. The string consists of terms In the formula k is the position of the term from the right side. The parameter   k 002 embodies the effect of the position k of term. It ensures that the term located in the right side is more important than the left. The function    j i k f f W is used to compare the terms at the same position k  k k   1 2   002  002 2 002   jk ik jk ik j i k f f f f f f W  003   1 1     002 3 002  We use formula \(4\ to calculate the similarity threshold t      1 1 n k t n k 002 002   000    002 4 002  The ES algorithm maps entries to concepts in a hierarchy according the name compounding. For example drywhitewine 024F,Q:59ØG is a subclass of “whitewine  Q:59ØG and “whitewine Q:59ØG is a subclass of wine 59ØG and “wine 59ØG is subclass of alcohol G Most taxonomy relations between concepts are finding  But, the hierarchy is rough. The named rule is not fit for every entry. So, some entries are put on a wrong position. For example, “red_ alcohol 4vG is a sibling concept of “wine 59ØG in the hierarchy. In the fact red_ alcohol 4vG is a shortened form of “redwine 4v 59ØG It is a child concept of “wine 59ØG Another entry name is rooted in pronounce of its foreign name. for example “PinotNoir T¥\012•A It is a type of grape. There is not information about the grape in the entry name  3.2. Feature text \(FT\ extract  In the description, several of information is mixed together. Only the feature text, which embodies its dissimilarity with other entries, is needed. To eliminate the disturbed information, we extract the feature text from the description at first Where the FT of an entry appears In description of an entry, it contains its FT and other information, which maybe talk about the subclass entries To distinguish these subclass entries, the definitions of subclass entries are a good choice  For example, the description of “wine 59ØG  consists of the definition, the classification \(definition of redwine 4v:59ØG definition of “whitewine Q:59ØG  and so on\ the history, the taste, and the culture about the wine”. The definition is the FT of the “wine 59ØG the description of “redwine 4v:59ØG consists of the definition, the classification \(definition of “CabernetFranc  012•\004\021 definition of “CabernetSauvignon R?·4 nd so on\. The definition of “redwine 4v:59ØG which co occurrence in two description, is the FT of the redwine 4v:59ØG  To extract the FT of an object entry, we select correlative sentences in its ancestry entries at first.  The description of the ancestry entry consists of many paragraphs. If only the object entries name exists in a paragraph, all the sentences in the paragraph will be selected. If both the object entry name and other entries name exist in the same paragraph, the selected sentences range from the sentence that contains the object entry name to the sentence that contains other entry name Obviously, the similar sentence exists in both its description and its ancestry’s description is the FT of it. At the same time, the sentence is excluded from FT of its ancestry entry  We use formula \(5\ to calculate the similarity between sentences         max         2 1 2 1 2 1 s t t s t t s t s t t s s sim i i i i i i 004 004 004 005 004   002 5 002  The formula \(5\ calculates the proportion of the terms which cooccurrence in both S1 and S2   3.3. FTs similarity calculating  To eliminate the influence of the named rule of entries 002 the entry is deleted from the FT. Then, the system uses the vector model to calculate the similarity         006 006 006 006    j i j i j i FT FT FT FT FT FT sim  002 6 002  If the similarity is 1, there is a “sameas” relation between entries. For example, the “red_rose_wine 4v\*D 59ØG is same as the “rose_red_wine 59ØG

  The “dry_white_wine 024F,Q:59ØG is same as the dry_white 024F,Q But, the entries maybe locate in different place of the hierarchy. For example, the rose_red_wine 4v:59ØG is a subclass of the red_wine 4v:59ØG the “red_rose_wine 4v\:59 G is a subclass of the “wine 59ØG So, taxonomy relations must be corrected. If the similarity between FTs is larger than a threshold, they are sibling. The system locates the entry according its sibling’s location  4  Experiments The system select “wine 59ØG topic in Chinese baidu encyclopedia Wiki   t h e r e  a r e 221 e n t r i e s a b o u t  the topic. All the entries are correlated to the “wine”. There are 19 classifications in the topic. The table 1 shows the proportion of entries name that can be segment   Table 1: the proportion of entries name that can be segment 000F\000O\000D\000V\000V\000L\000I\000L\000F\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q 000Q\000D\000P\000H\000\003\000F\000D\000Q\000\003\000E\000H 000V\000H\000J\000P\000H\000Q\000W 000W\000K\000H\000\003\000Q\000X\000P\000E\000H\000U\000\003\000R\000I 000H\000Q\000W\000U\000L\000H\000V G&\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\014 000\026\000\023 000\026\000\031 000\033\000\026\000\021\000\026\000\026 59Ø\000\013\000J\000U\000D\000S\000H\000\014 000\033 000\025\000\024 000\026\000\033\000\021\000\024\000\023 59Ø\014Á\000\013\000J\000U\000D\000S\000H\000U\000\\\000\014 000\024\000\032 000\025\000\024 000\033\000\023\000\021\000\034\000\030 59ØG&\024X 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 007p\015\016\000\013\000I\000D\000U\000P\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\014Á\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003 000J 000D\000U\000G\000H 000Q 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&KÕ\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000F\000D\000E\000L\000Q\000H 000\030 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\015¢\000\003\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000W\000R\000Z\000Q\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\011V\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000U\000\\\000\014 000\031 000\024\000\024 000\030\000\027\000\021\000\030\000\030 G&\035C\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000F\000X\000S\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 007@\011Ì\000\013\000F\000R\000U\000S\000\014 000\025\000\024 000\027\000\025 000\030\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 015\004\011\016\000\013\000D\000U\000H\000D\000\014 000\025 000\026 000\031\000\031\000\021\000\031\000\032 024X\014Á\000\003\000P\000D\000Q\000R\000U 000\031\000\026 000\031\000\026 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 004{\011\016 000\027 000\027 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000R\000W\000K\000H\000U 000\030 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000W\000R\000W\000D\000O 000\024\000\032\000\024 000\025\000\025\000\024 000\032\000\032\000\021\000\026\000\033   After executing the ES algorithm, we form a hierarchy The root node of the hierarchy is a virtual node-- “thing All of 19 classifications are its child nodes. We will compare this hierarchy with an expert-defined ontology that is downloaded from [11  P r eci s i o n  an d  r eca ll ar e th e n  u s ed  to evaluate the hierarchy. We defined two kinds of precision evaluation methods, as follows. classification precision demonstrates the precision of the classification which the entries belong to; location precision shows the precision of the location in the hierarchy.

Table 3 listed the relationships between expert ontology and the hierarchy corrected by calculating the FTs similarity. Based on the foregoing, the classification precision C-Precision is up to 95 LPrecision\(C_L is up to 90%, and the Recall is up to 95 The figure 3 shows a part of the wine ontology generated by system. The gray concept 012•G locate in a error location. The main reason of the error is that too fewer information can be used. None other entry is similar to the concept. So, the error generated by ES algorithm can not revise

The normalization constant  out was set to 20 and  in value was computed over the data set The remaining parameter settings were kept the same as the previous AC-ViSOM network applied on 2D Gaussian data set. AC-ViSOM’s visualization for this WBC data set was presented in Figure 11   Figure 11: AC-ViSOM’s visualization for WBC data set, dead neuron=34.5%, MSE=0.193   Figure 11 demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce data structure preserved visualization with more active neurons in the map than that of ViSOM projected in Figure 10 for this high dimensional data set. Figure 11 also demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce a better data representation justified by low MSE obtained compared against that of ViSOM The above experiments have shown that ACViSOM is able to produced less dead neurons for better network utilization, optimised data representation with lower MSE value, and appealing data structure preserved visualization as compared with ViSOM  6. Conclusion and future works In this paper, an extension of ViSOM was proposed by hybridising modified Adaptive Coordinate \(AC\ approach and ViSOM network as AC-ViSOM. Empirical studies have shown that, ACViSOM is able to eliminate the trial and error process of selecting suitable resolution control parameter of ViSOM. Besides, it is able to minimize the number of dead neurons in the map as well as optimise the data representation as compared with that of ViSOM. This better network utilization ability of AC-ViSOM has a potential to minimize the map size requirements to produce effective data visualization For the future works, the research will look forward to define a way of increasing AC-ViSOM inter-neuron distance preservation ability. The method on how to define a suitable initialisation process for the weight vectors to represent the data density information will also be investigated  Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Fundamental Research Grant Scheme 27\d Universiti Malaysia Sarawak for funding this work  7.

the number of steps\. The advantage of applying dynamic programming instead of standard mathematical programming tools is twofold. First, the special structure of the optimization problem is effectively exploited. Second, no continuous-valued variable has to be taken into account. The computational requirements of the proposed approach have been experimentally evaluated in connection with a real case study, and have been proven to be compatible with a real-time implementation of the procedure Future developments may regard the comparison of results with the use of empirical curves based on complex upconing models \(such as the one formulated by Zhou d th e ex pan s ion of t h es e m odel s  to more wells that influence each other. As regards the proposed methodology, future development may include a generalization of the formalization of the optimal control strategy to more binary variables for each stage, more state equations about the setting time needed by the pump when it is turned on-off, and integer variables instead of binary variables. Then future developments of the presented DSS regard the definition of an Identification module in which the information as regards predicted concentration pumping pattern, observed data can be used to identify models for the system state equations and to update the parameters. Finally, further aspects that can be added include a sensitivity analysis performed by varying the weight s coefficients in the objective function, and the use of other multi-objective approaches   8.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS.

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
