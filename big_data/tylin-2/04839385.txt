The DINET EOC housed ground nodes that produced and consumed \223payload\224 data that was relayed through the DTN router on board the DI spacecraft The EOC also controlled the topology among the nodes altering the connectivity to test DTN functionality.  An additional node in the EOC acted to perform administrative functions, and contained the Monitor and Control System to view experiment health and concurrently collect and analyze the data delivery status and statistics.

space networks formed by multiple relay radio links For example, to retrieve data from a rover on Mars, current practice is for the rover operations team to manually schedule the uplink procedure and files to be sent from the rover to an orbiter for relay to earth. The orbiter team likewise has to coordinate with the rover team, manually schedule the transmission of data from the orbiter to one of 3 DSN stations, which in turn use the internet to complete the transfer of data to the orbiter operations site, which then has to arrange to forward the appropriate files to the rover operations location If there are multiple orbiters that the rovers may use to relay data back to earth, additional operations teams have to be consulted.  If there are any anomalies or unplanned outages of the various radio links, the whole plan must be recreated 
by these teams. All-in-all this is a very labor-intensive process Normal internet protocols that can route around failures provide for quality of service and automatic retransmission of missing data will not work well, if at all, in a space network environment. Internet protocols require end-to-end connectivity; intermediate routers do not store any data, and if the next hop is not available, the packets are discarded Even with the existence of an end-to-end path from the operations center through the DSN, a relay satellite and thence to the rover, the light time delay to Mars would make many of the \223chatty\224 handshaking protocols \(like TCP unworkable. Were UDP used to transport packets over a 


  2 space network, a reliability mechanism would still be needed since retransmission is not done by UDP DTN was conceived and developed to work around these limitations of terrestrial internet protocols while maintaining interoperability with them. This, in effect, extends the internet into deep space networks The DTN suite of protocols provides for these features 1  Automated routing 2  Store-and-forward operation at intermediate DTN nodes \(analogous to terrestrial routers 3  Quality of service provisions 4  Authentication and encryption mechanisms 5  A link reliability / automated retransmission mechanism DTN \223bundles\224 are akin to internet \223packets\224, and the DTN bundles may be transported via radio using the Licklider Transport Protocol \(LTP - a reliability mechanism for deep space links ble link protocol, or via standard internet TCP/IP DTN addresses extreme and performance-challenged environments where continuous end-to-end connectivity cannot be assumed.  Recogniti on and interest in DTN has shown a rapid rise, with diverse applications ranging among such areas as battlefield communications, habitat and environmental sensor network monitoring systems, and mobile consumers having interm ittent connectivity with the Internet.  For example, the June 2008 IEEE Journal of Selected Areas of Communicati ons was dedi cat ed t o t h e DTN topic.  Space communications represents a key application domain for DTN, arising from disconnections as orbiters lose line-of-sight communications with landers long propagation delays over inte rplanetary links, and other phenomena.

Several elements are envisioned in the overarching program of advancing DTN\222s readiness, such as experiments on the Intern ational Space Station.  A critical development milestone is the first demonstration of DTN in a spacecraft flying in d eep space.  This experiment is known as the Deep Impact NETwork \(DINET\flight experiment DINET made use of the Deep Impact \(DI\spacecraft.  The DI prime mission successfully took place on July 4, 2005, in which a probe was released and impacted the Tempel 1 comet, producing a crater and ejecting material that was imaged by the DI spacecraft.  On July 3rd, 2007, NASA approved the Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation \(EPOXI\ission.  EPOXI is a mission of opportunity that continues operation of the DI flyby objectives to 1 observations of stars known to have planets and photometrically detect extrasolar planets and to 2 encounter the Comet Hartley 2 In 2008, the EPOXI mission was expanded to incorporate DINET, a technology validation experiment of JPL\222s implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols DINET will take place during otherwise quiescent duration between the EPOCh \(Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact eXtended Investigation\he EPOXI mission.  DINET consists of uploading JPL\222s ION flight software onto one of the DI spacecraft\222s flight com puters.  In addition, ION software will be configured on several computers on the ground.  A virtual topology will be constructed, with the DI spacecraft acting as a DTN bundle relay node with data being passed among the other nodes.  Deep Space Network DSN\racking/communications passes were scheduled with the EPOXI mission to support this experiment and a number of specific DTN technology validation metrics were levied as requirements on the DINET mission.  DINET operations were conducted in autumn of 2008 Figure 1 depicts the basic layout of the virtual topology of 


  3 the experiment.  The central node is the Deep Impact spacecraft which serves as a bundle router to pass the payload data from one space regi on to another space region The central node is the DI spacecraft, which does not generate source data but acts as a DTN bundle router and also implements the LTP retransmission protocol in response to induced bundle loss.  The three end nodes simulate space regions, Eart h, Mars, and Phobos, and produce and consume the payload data.  These nodes are all computers on the ground also implementing the ION DTN software.  The ground node computers are contained within the Experiment Operations Center \(EOC\ich will be described in greater detail in the next section.  The links dashed lines\termittent depending on schedule  Figure 1 226 DINET virtual topology The ground computers physically connect to the DI spacecraft via the Deep Space Network \(DSN operates three complexes that are geographically distributed over the Earth to ensure coverage no matter where the spacecraft appears in the sky.  To connect to these complexes, interface equipment is maintained and operated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\The intermediate interface system is referred to as DSOT \(Data System Operations Team\ is illustrated in Figure 2 below, divided into the primary components of the DI spacecraft, DSOT, and the EOC.  As depicted, additional nodes have been implemented beyond the simple diagram of Figure 1 in order to simplify integration and to enhance flexibility in operation.  Also visible in Figure 2 are the EOC Experiment Database and Load/Go elements 


  4  Figure 2 \226 DINET system components In the network, \223payload\224 data starts from one end node and is first routed to the ground system of that end node region then to the Deep Im pact spacecraft via RF links, then to the ground system of the destination region, and eventually arrives the destination end node.  The payload data are exchanged in the form of bundles.  The source nodes produce and consume data in the EOC using the Asynchronous Message Service  \(AMS C C S DS draft  standard publish & subscribe functions.  Thus the EOC plays the role of exercising th e data exchanges.  The EOC also controls the topology among the nodes, altering the connectivity to test DTN functionality.  In addition, the EOC monitors the delivery status among all end nodes.  A different node in the EOC acts to perform administrative functions, and contains the Monitor and Control System to collect and analyze the data delivery status and statistics essential for the developers to view experiments and perform post-analyses.  The software diagnostic messages and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed, stored in to a database in real-time This application also provide s a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries The messages includes ION soft ware status messages, ION bundle status report messages \(BSRs\and node publish/subscription messages 3  DINET  E XPERIMENTAL O PERATIONS C ENTER  An essential component of the DINET project is the Experiment Operations Center \(EOC\c functions of the EOC are 1  Produce Experiment Payload Data 225  Input: JPEG image files 225  Single file per bundle 225  Mark bundle priority 225  Meter output to specified data rate 2  Consume Experiment Payload Data 225  Store in local file sy stem at node upon reception 225  Display image upon reception 3  Consume Software Diagnostic Messages \(ION logs 225  ION log messages transmitted to EOC software via TCP/IP socket

Figure 3 shows the PTL  Figure 3 \226 Protocol Technology Lab The EOC played the role of exercising the data exchange and monitoring the delivery status among all end nodes Three machines in PTL were designated to simulate the end nodes \(\223Earth\224, \223Mars\224 and \223Phobos\224\ishing and subscribing to data using the AMS \(Asynchronous Message System\protocol over the ION network, where the data rate, DTN priority, and other transmission statistics were involved in the simulation and analysis.  Another three machines in the PTL were used to simulate the routers in the space regions located between the end nodes and the ground systems.  A seventh machine and two large screens in the PTL were employed as the administrative node and the visualization system to m onitor and analyze the data delivery status and statistics for the DINET experiment The execution of the Monitor and Control system in the administrative node helps researchers perform more informative and useful ION experiments.  Figure 4 shows the software architecture of Monitor and Control System and the relationship with other DINET elements 


  6  Figure 4 \226 DINET Structure and software for the administrative node  Software Modules of Monitor and Control System The Monitor and Control System is designed as a multi-tier client-server web application.  A middleware is used to service data requests between the user and the database This hierarchical structure ma kes the application extensible and distributive.  The framework of the Monitor and Control System in the EOC utilizes the technologies of Java,  JavaScript, AJAX, JSP \(JavaServer Page MySQL database to provide the means for the DTN network administrator to monitor ION data delivery and operational status effectively.  The devised infrastructure of the Monitor and Control system can be further extended to monitor the operation status, data transmission and the topology updates fo r other space mission simulations As shown in Figure 5, the Monitor and Control System in the EOC consists of four major executable pieces DINETLogProcessor, DINETAdm,  DINETQueryAdm, and DINETTopology.  DINETLogProce ssor sets up the TCP/IP socket connection to all simulated nodes to receive the ION status messages, parse and categorize the messages, and deposit the messages into the SQL database DINETLogProcessor also sends signals to DINETAdm via TCP/IP socket to inform of the arrival of status messages DINETTopology is a topology description generator which dynamically updates the network topology description in xml format based on the ION network configuration, which is initialized prior to missi on operations a nd updated during the course of the mission.  Similar to DINETLogProcessor DINETopology also notifies DINETAdm of any changes in the network topology via TCP/IP socket.  DINETAdm is a web-based graphic display system which updates the display of the network topology and the ION status messages in real time based on notices from both DINETLogProcessor and DINETTopology units DINETQueryAdm provides another web-based graphic display which interactively accep ts and responses to users\222 queries on ION status messages.  Under the four major executables, there are five libraries constructed to support several specific functions.  They are LibDatabase LibLogProcessor, LibSocket, LbLogProvide and LibTopology.  The functions of each library are described as follows 200  LibDatabase:  manipulate and interface to the database, including setting connections to the database, creating tables in the database, inserting data into tables, and querying table content 200  LibLogProcessor: build the database and tables for the experiment and parse, classify, and store messages in the database 200  LibSocket: set the socket on the server side and receive messages from remote clients 200  LibLogProvider: interface to LibDatabase Interpret the query issued from the application send the query to the database, and return the query result to the application 200  LibTopology: parse the topology description in xml format and draw the network topology with the use of a Java applet  


  7  Figure 5 \226Software modules of the Monitor and Control System Types of ION Status Messages The Monitor and Control Sy stem in the EOC received messages from all nodes in DINET during mission operations via TCP/IP socket and the ION stack.  The messages included ION softwa re status messages, ION Bundle Protocol status report messages, and publish/subscription messages.  All messages were formatted in consistent plain text style prior to arriving to the processing unit of the destination, i.e DINETLogProcessor at the administrative node of the EOC Bundle Protocol status reports were issued by all nodes in the network and sent to the administration node in the form of DTN bundles via the ION stack.  Bundles which contained the status reports were further logged into plain text format, as were other ION status messages.  Bundle status reports inform of the deletion of any undelivered bundle and the administrative node may choose to initiate some specific network mana gement action upon reception of the message.  ION software status messages were logged by all nodes and programmatically redirected to a mechanism enabling them to be transmitted to the administrative node via TCP/IP, not via the ION stack However, messages logged by the Deep Impact spacecraft were encapsulated in EVR telemetry packets.  As the ground system received these packets, it ex tracted the encapsulated log messages and re-transmitted the messages to the administrative node via TCP/IP socket connection ION status messages are of five general types: informational message, warning message, diagnostic message communication statistics message, and other status messages. Informational messages mainly inform the occurrence of events that ar e nominal but significant Warning messages inform of th e occurrence of events that are off-nominal but are likely due to configuration or operational error rather than software failure.  Diagnostic messages inform of the occurre nce of events that are offnominal and might be due to software errors.  A communication statistics message provides network performance statistics over a stat ed interval.  An \223other status message\224 is seen in response to specific operatorinitiated activity.  The publish/subscription messages denote the publish and subscription status from the end nodes involved in publish or subscription operations. All these status messages and statistics help the mission operations team keep abreast of the network data flow and experiment status Installation and Execution of the Monitor and Control System in the PTL In the PTL, the Monitor and Control software package is installed on a Linux workstation with two large screens which serves as the administrative node and visualization 


  8 system in EOC software devel opment.  One screen is used to display the main page of the Monitor and Control System GUI, and the other screen shows the GUI query page and xterm consoles of other nodes in the EOC.  Figure 6 is an example shot of the main GUI page. In the page, either an existing experiment name or a new experiment name is selected for executing operati ons.  There are 11 tables on the page which display live messages respectively received from DINET nodes.  The message display is started by selecting the \223start/update\224 button and temporarily paused by  selecting the \223Pause\224 button.  Moreover, all messages received and stored in the database can be dumped into a text file as the \223save\224 button is selected and a file name is entered. The top and middle of the page shows the network topology which is updated dynamically as the network connectivity changes  Figure 6 \226 Monitor and Control System GUI main page Figure 7 shows an example of the GUI query page.  In order to query the messages stored in the database, an experiment name is specified along with \(optionally\essage type message source node, number of messages, message creation time, and then the \223query\224 button is clicked.  The messages stored in the data which meet the query criterion are shown on the table of the query page, and those resultant messages can also be dumped into a text file by clicking the \223save\224 button and entering a file name.  The table content and topology display on both web GUI page are locally and dynamically updated without interfering with the display of the main page by the use of Ajax and Java servlet techniques

With the results gathered from the operations cen ter software, an analysis was performed on the experime nt outcome characterizing the overall performance of DTN From a broad perspective, the experiment was a success in that it proved the ION software capable of space mission operation and raised the technology readiness level to that of a tested and flown software package.  The DTN concept proved capable of automatically re-transmitting missing or corrupt data without flight team intervention, specifically demonstrated during several small unplanned communications outages at DSN stations.  DTN management actions were requi red to update the ION clock aboard EPOXI on a semiweekly basis to compensate for a drifting spacecraft clock, as well as insert new routes after an unplanned power outage across the EOC network Experiment analysis yielded DTN performance benchmarks in link utilization, prioritizati on, node storage and routing For all passes with sufficient data in the transmission queue DINET maintained a link utilization rate over 90%, even when introducing artificial link errors by dropping approximately every 32 nd LTP segment.  Received data analysis confirmed that higher priority information maintained an advantage over lower priority information and also that this advantag e increased as link capacity diminished \(due to the artificial data loss on the link\.  The node storage utilization benc hmark provided proof that node storage usage stabilized over the course of the experiment, approaching steadystate.  An analysis of network traversal showed that data was efficiently moved through different paths as dictated by the ION routing algorithm when the network topology changed. This demonstrated the advantages of the routing automation afforded by the ION routing protocol 5  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper has briefly described the JPL Deep Impact Network \(DINET\ay/Disruption Networking \(DTN technology experiment, intended to increase the technical readiness DTN for space missions and supporting ground and space-based relay infrastruct ure.  This represents the first deep space implementation of DTN in flight and ground software, and paves the way for future space networks.  DINET demonstrated the Interplanetary Overlay Network \(ION\mplementation of DTN, which incorporates the Bundle Protocol and LTP retransmission protocol.  We have described the DINET Experiment Operations Center \(EOC its functions in accomplishing this experiment.  The DINET EOC starts all ION processes experiment data sources, stat us message receiver processes and display processes.  The ION-based Monitor and Control System is an innovative, intranet-based software application which receives status messages and displays live results from the DINET network.  With this Monitor and Control application, the ION software and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed stored into a database in real-time.  This application also provides a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and the Nationa l Aeronautics and Space Administration

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
