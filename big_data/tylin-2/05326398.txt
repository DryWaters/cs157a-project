Abstract 
In this paper we introduce a deployment model for wireless sensor networks for pervasive health care based on the concepts of patient area networks and medical sensor networks and propose a complete and efficient security framework for them Our security framework is organized into three layers addressing the operational requirements and security needs at the patient area network medical sensor network and back-end levels We specify how these layers are interconnected with each other as well as the needed security mechanisms that allow for the efficient and practical deployment of secure pervasive health care systems based on wireless sensor networks Index

operated by potentially various different organizations while her health state is seamlessly and securely monitored Our model for pervasive healthcare is a combined model between traditional

Thus are decoupled from each other as they may belong to different organizations from different and are only temporarily associated to that user Therefore the in the pervasive healthcare system depends on the user's location or healthcare institution The medical data sensed by means of a can be forwarded to back-end healthcare services that ensure the system interoperability Le it allows a user carrying a to move across and are i resource constrained devices with just a few and low-rate radios A key requirement for health applications concerns the ii maximum allowed latency For instance

NETWORKS FOR PERVASIVE HEAL THCARE OUR VISION Health monitoring is one of the envisioned applications of forming a and the back-end security layers Fourth we motivate and describe the main security mechanisms needed in each of those layers This paper pays special attention to the the patient area networks and the back-end services An used to monitor the health state of the users in that location or health institution at a given moment Consequently is a set of in a specific In this setting the is required to protect the users medical information in the whole system from the sensor nodes to

security domain For our attack model we assume that attackers have universal communication presence in the whole system Second we assume the existence of trusted and untrusted devices A trusted device cannot be compromised as we assume that it is located in a secure location or it is tamper\255 resistant e.g a smart card An  f\(x,y of degree or sensed and and consuming negligible amount of computational and communication resources to avoid Denial of Service attacks Second fast operation is needed in order to not disturb the clinical workflow e.g during the ward round of a doctor and prevent attackers from launching and mobile or devices to the or the or medical data is collectively known IV OVERALL SECURITY FRAMEWORK We propose a security framework for the pervasive healthcare system based on a and back-end services The main features of these layers are as follows The allows each healthcare organization e.g a hospital to manage the security in its security domain It allows any pair of devices or users in the same to bootstrap a secure communication link and identify each other For this layer we focus on lightweight and distributed cryptographic methods for key establishment and device identification These mechanisms are i lightweight to fulfill the delay requirements and save the scarce node resources and ii distributed to fit the medical workflow in they encounter in a direct way although both and clinicians are continuously moving Note that this layer includes allows a user to manage the security in her own patient area network and ensures the secure disclosure of her measured medical data when interacting with e.g clinicians in an ensures the secure operation of users and and V is based on our previous work presented in We summarize this layer here since the rest of the layers interact with it The security model for a stand-alone relies on a central semi\255 online trust center a tamper-resistant central authority operated by the Keying material refers to the cryptographic information stored in each entity and that allows for distributed key agreement access control and identification Semi-online trust center means that the trust center is not required for the above key agreement and access control handshakes during system operation since they are carried out in a distributed fashion We use lightweight security primitives based on polynomials providing full connectivity between any pair of entities belonging to the same In the basic approach  a single symmetric bivariate polynomial over a fmite field is big enough to accommodate a cryptographic key is used to generate a polynomial share for each entity An entity trust center and stores the share by using the PAN 253 medical sensors and devices but also other fixed environment sensors used to measure e.g temperature or humidity The MSN PANs MSNs can be neither tracked nor linked nor disclosed without authorization Besides the specific features of attacks Third scalability is a must to enable a truly ubiquitous and secure healthcare system for large numbers of and back-end services Each layer provides specific security algorithms as well as the physical elements and technologies needed in our framework to fulfill the specific operational requirements and ensure for seamless interaction between and back\255 end services The security management of this layer is centralized and it relies on a trusted device linked to and controlled by the patient The where Digital Object Identifier 10.41 OB/ICST MOBIQUITOUS2009 6B32 http://dx.doi org/10 PANs RAM MSNs

derive two secrets from the master symmetric key key for the current session Si as The key is used to create a security domain wherein the basic transmissions e.g for configuration are encrypted and authenticated Second we adapt the lightweight approach described of Somiotti et al to enable controlled access to the depending on the corresponding access control restrictions This approach is based on an access control hash chain for the current session We generate the anchor of the hash chain as element of the chain is calculated by applying times a hash function on the anchor This hash chain

architecture considering the concepts of and their inherent relationships This problem has not been addressed before for the best of our knowledge For related work on topology formation However this scheme presents three main drawbacks First it is still an open issue the secure connection of on-body with off-body devices since the latter cannot measure physiological parameters of the user Second the assumption that all sensors can measure a common vital sign does not hold in practice Third related approaches for key generation based on and and ii the provision of services such as privacy-aware identification The provision of an end-to-end secure link is not enough as arbitrary s with different security layer such as the methods to configure a identification in the whole system Our preliminary performance and operation analysis shows that our security architecture can operate in a very efficient way without modifying the expected medical workflow Simplicity is keep in mind for easy autonomous and Deployment and Workflow Use Case control approach used has been proved to be feasible for sensor nodes C Robert our user in Fig 1 has joined a new pervasive healthcare system offering strong security services as he wants to protect and control the disclosure of his own Robert can plug his into his phone creating a secure link with back-end services and identifying himself Sometimes Robert has to go to the hospital for a regular medical examination When Robert arrives at the hospital's admission desk he uses his for identification and billing Afterwards the is inserted into a hospital and a mutual authentication handshake is carried out based on public key cryptography The is configured with the corresponding keying material lightweight digital certificate and access control policy for the hospital at this step after secure access with the central healthcare Later a nurse simply attaches a set of to Robert's body Each automatically communicates with Robert's carrying out a key agreement authentication and authentication handshake over Each that successfully finishes this step becomes a member of Robert's are stored on the Robert's log file As a doctor wants to monitor Robert's vital signs he briefly touches him establishing a channel between and her and completing an authentication and authorization handshake If the clinician holds enough

Misic have worked on the area of security and medical applications contributing many publications such as Researchers at Harvard University  and Imperial College 34 have pointed out the use of public-key cryptography to set up secure communication links between body sensor nodes our security layer However the performance of public-key primitives is prohibitive for many real-world settings

  11 processing, and the result is a list of files that propagates up to the server side layer For subsetting, latitude and longitude values are handled at the model layer, and translated \(when necessary correct coordinate values for the underlying engine.  Also to reduce the number of parameters a user would need to provide, we support user inputs of date/time string using the ISO 8601 format, the International Standard for the representation of dates and tim For exam pl e t h e input string \2232008-10-31T12:00:00Z\224, would be converted into a GregorianCalendar inst ance representing that exact date/time for the model layer Using the combination of GregorianCalendar and the ISO 8601 standard allows us to easily handle timezone-aware and timezone-na\357ve inputs. Internally to our \223business logic\224 model layer, all date/times are timezone-aware and set to the UTC timezone to match most of the instrument data conventions. But if the user provides a timezone-na\357ve date/time, that is with no timezone specified, then we promote it to UTC standard time. We also support user input in any timezone here we leverage the GregorianCalendar to convert any timezone to the UTC internal representation This simplifies science studies where users simply provide the local time at the area of interest to query data for  7  C LIENT I MPLEMENTATION FOR A NALYSIS E NVIRONMENTS  We implemented client-side modules to adapt to the major working environments favored by most scientists: \(1 4\thon, \(5\/C++, and \(6 Fortran90. Unlike other approaches that force the scientists to leave their familiar working environment to access data our services tool set brings the data access and manipulation back into their working envi ronments. Whenever possible we also aimed to develop the ability to automatically download and construct the native data objects in each respectively environment. This eliminates the need for the end user to worry about data file downloads, local file management, and loading them into in-memory data arrays for manipulation. A consistent experience is given to the user, both across the different tools and across the different platforms, with common interfaces and usage conventions This form of seamless integration directly facilitates the transparent access and manipula tion of heterogeneous data as called for by NASA\222s ACCESS NRA goals Java The Java client was designed to be an importable jar library from any user Java application. Since the Web Service endpoint server was already written with Sun\222s JAX-WS Reference Implementation, we also chose the same for the Java client implementation. This maximizes interoperability since both client and server utilize the same library. The client contains high-level methods for calling the Web Service and automatically downloading the custom-created files, allowing the entire process of service querying and downloading data to be contained in a single method call Lower level methods are also exposed in the service allowing the user more fine-grain control over the data flow and interface with the Web Services Matlab Mathwork\222s Matlab is a popular working environment used by scientists to perform science analysis. The 2008 release of Matlab has built-in support fo r Web Services with autocode-generation from WSDL URLs. It leverages the Java integration that Mathworks has already worked into Matlab We leveraged this built-in capability to develop Matlab modules that access the same server-side Web Services for Level 2 and Level 3 data access and manipulation Our Matlab service client consists of a number of .m files file extension for Matlab custom code\and requires no Java package dependencies beyond the JVM native to the Matlab environment.  Built-in SOAP functions help to create, send, and parse the SOAP message, which is used to communicate with our remotely hosted Web Services For automatic data file downloads, classes and methods standard with Java version 1.5 \(standard with Matlab 7.6 were used to access and download the files via http.  The resulting client allows all of the Web Services and downloading functionality to be transparent to a user Matlab supports the construction and handling of full Java data objects and the invocation of Java class methods directly form within Matlab. We made use of built-in functions that served as the bridge between a Matlab script and a SOAP service call \(createSoapMessage.m callSoapService.m, and parseSoapResponse.m\. These built-in SOAP functions in Matlab constrained us to passing a narrow range of Matlab data types due an incomplete set of Matlab datatype to W3C SOAP datatypes. Particularly the date-time and arrays of strings must be manually handled as more primitive types Two methods of datetime passing were settled upon.  One relies simply upon passing a tuple representation of datetime\227a number for the year, and others for the month, day hour, minute, and second.  While such a method worked well \(converting simple numerical data types\t was seen to be cumbersome and made for far less readable code to have to use six parameters to specify a single datetime.  We turned then using short char acter strings to represent datetimes, following the ISO 8601 standard.  Data type conversion of character strings between Matlab and XML is similarly easy as numerical types, and made for very concise and readable function calls 


  12 Passing arrays of strings required a retreat from any kind of array-like data structure.  Instead, a single, long string was created from an array of strings in Matlab, separated by a distinct delimiter \(a \223,\224 in this case\s single long string is passed through the service interface to the endpoint server, which then parses the string back into a list format before continuing on with the rest of the call sequence IDL ITT\222s IDL is another powerful visualization and analysis tool popular with the Earth science analysis community  Unl i k e M a t l a b, IDL \(as of versi on 7.0 have any built-in Web Services support. IDL can be made to speak the Web Services languages via an IDL-Java bridge delegating the Web Services capability to a linked Java library.  This does allow calling the Web Services, but there were some issues encountered along the way First, the IDL-Java bridge connectivity required some setup and handling by the end user. Environment variables and jar classpaths must be properly configured. While this is easily resolve with an installer, there was a strong desire to minimize the IDL client foot print to where there are no dependencies. We wanted to provide an IDL client code that could be dropped into a directory somewhere and should \223just work\224 Second, there are some known issues working with objects in IDL. We encountered memory errors during execution which appeared to be a memory leak in the IDL-Java bridge there was previously a known memory leak that had been patched\also ex tra overhead when interfacing between IDL and Java where data is converted from Java objects to IDL types Our current effort is focused on building a \223poor man\222s\224 SOAP as part of our IDL client that will allow us to directly call and interface with the Web Services, without having to go through Java.  We plan to utilize IDL\222s built-in simple http support to send manually constructed SOAP messages Though this approach forgoes the robustness of the JAXWS implementation, it will however provide a pure IDL client to our end users with no external dependencies Python The Python scripting environment has become a popular working environment for fast prototyping and exploratory science processing. Among all of the clients here, the Python Web Services client is the most trivial. We leveraged the suds package, a lightweight SOAP client for consuming Web Services in Pyt Though ot her open-source Python Web Service packages exist \(such as ZSI\we have found suds to be the most easy to use and more dynamic in nature. Suds does not require class code generation and can read WSDLs at runtime to dynamically construct a proxy object with an interface representing the WSDL C/C We want any C/C++ client to be able to interact with the server-side Web Services of Level 2 and Level 3 data generation. By using the using the popular open-source gSOAP Toolkit for SOAP Web Services package  client-side modules can interact with the data generation services developed on the server-side. gSOAP also includes facilities to autogenerate C/C++ RPC code from our published WSDL definition files of the Web Service on the server. We have also found that gSOAP has a good selfcontained XML bindings facility Fortran Fortran90 modules can be made capable of remotely accessing and the Level 2 and Level 3 data. Though Fortran has no built-in libraries to perform Web Services, we leveraged our C/C++ Web Service API via gSOAP to do the work. Fortran can call an 223externed\224 C Web Service API and pass back the relevant data into the Fortran environment. This would enable Fortran to fully delegate the Web Services operations to the C/C++ implementation 8  NEWS  L EVEL 2  P RODUCTS  With the availability of the software infrastructure supporting server-side processing, and seamless client-side data query and access, downstream data products can now be generated from the source merged NEWS Level 2 data Averaged One of the most common wa ys to summarize the large amount of data is to calculate the averages of data within a given temporal and spatial boundary. For example, it is very useful for scientists to make daily, weekly, monthly averages of some parameters in a regular latitude-longitudepressure grid, make a global map of the average, and analyze any global patterns and trends. In order to facilitate the needs, we developed an averaging Web Service to generate averaged data products that a user can customize The input arguments for the averaging Web Service are the time range, time granule, and a list of parameter names to produce averaged products with. The time range specifies the start and end time to access the NEWS data from. The time granule specifies the aver aging time period. The list of parameter names specifies the choice of parameters that are requested to make averaged products Subsetted Subsetting a data set is a fundamental way to access specific data from a large collection of data. We developed a usercustomizable subsetting Web Service that supports three general subsetting conditions 1  Spatial condition \(latitude, longitude, vertical range 


  13 2  Temporal condition \(e.g. from 2002-05 to 2002-07 3  Parameter selection \(e.g. te mperature and atmospheric water vapor only The combination of these three conditions allows a user to subset data in time, location, and parameter space 9  NEWS  L EVEL 3  P RODUCTS  Many of these quantities in NEWS L2 product interact through fundamental physical processes \(e.g. temperature affects cloudiness, and also the converse\ Consequently the observations should be treated as statistically separate variables, though traditiona l methods of summarizing satellite data do just that. We applied statistical clustering methods to a multiple-parameter set of observations from the A-Train instruments over the multi-year record. The resulting Level 3 quantitative summaries are made accessible through our serv ice-oriented tool Level 3Q Level 3Q data sets are statistical summaries of underlying Level 2 data. Like traditional Level 3 products they are 223gridded\224 in the sense that they provide a summary of Level 2 data belonging to space-time grid cells. These cells are typically defined as one or fi ve degree spatial regions over a time period of one or eight days, or one calendar month Unlike traditional Level 3 products, the Level 3Q \(L3Q grid cell summaries provide nonparametric multivariate estimates of the joint probability distributions of multiple geophysical parameters. Distribution estimates are derived from the underlying Level 2 data using informationtheoretic principles that balance the quality of the estimate against the amount of data reduction achieved  Figure 9. Raw and summarized data for one grid cell Raw data belonging to that grid cell can be listed in a data table with one row for each of N data points and one column for each variable \(here, two alternate representation: a scatter plot. In both cases each data point has weight 1. On the right are two representations of the compressed summary. The data table has K<<N rows and two extra columns showing cluster count and distortion. Counts are shown in the corresponding scatter plot by the bar heights  Data reduction replaces a larg e number of individual data points with a smaller number of representative data points and associated weights and quality measures. Figure 9 illustrates the basic concept. The idea is to treat a set of coincident measurement of different geophysical parameters for the same footprint as a multivariate vector, and collect all such vectors belonging to a given spatial-temporal grid cell as a set of points in high-dimensional data space. These data are partitioned into disjoi nt groups, called clusters, and we report the following statistic s for each: i\the centroid which is the representative, ii\he number or proportion of original data points assigned to it, and iii\the average squared distance between member data points and the centroid. This latter quantity is also called the cluster distortion The method that assigns data points to clusters is an adaptation of a signal-processing algorithm called Entropyconstrained Vector Quantizati EC VQ i s si m i l a r t o  the well-known K-means clusteri  Kmeans finds an assignment of raw data points to K clusters that minimize distortion. ECVQ finds an assignment that minimizes a quantity based partly on distortion, but also on the entropy of the probability distribution defined by the clustering. Entropy is a measure of information-theoretic complexity, and it is also well known that greater complexity is required to achieve lower distorti  ECVQ was originally proposed as a way of estimating this trade-off. The algorithm may find fewer than K groups as it attempts to balance the competing goals of fidelity to the original data and parsimony of representation.  This produces the smallest, or more properly, the least complex output data set that achieves a given level of fidelity to the original data. Our version of ECVQ is adapted in a number of ways for use as a massive data set reduction tool. These are described in detail in  and 26  W e  have al so previously employed our version of ECVQ to produce monthly summaries of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder data  The algorithm\222s output is best thought of as an estimate of the multivariate distribution of the data in a given space-time grid box. The original data have a distribution that puts probability  N on each multivariate data point, where N is the number of data points. ECVQ coarsens this distribution by collecting similar points into clusters, representing them by cluster centroids, and assigning probabilities N k k where N k is the number of point assigned to the k th cluster. In addition we also report the within-cluster mean squared error distortion\, which is a measure of the quality of the cluster representative as a stand-in for the original data assigned to it 1 N to cluster  


  14 10  A NALYSIS R ESULTS  AIRS, AMSR-E, MODIS and CLOUDSAT data have been merged into a dataset by the NEWS effort, and a framework of Web Services for averaging, subsetting and statistical analysis have been developed. Collectively it facilitates the data access and analysis of hydr ological processes. Here we present an example usage of instrument intercomparison Comparing Data Products Prior to Merging A necessary step in creating a formal merged data product is intercomparison of component data sets.  This ensures that the mutual random and systematic differences between the two data sets are quantified.  This approach does not provide information about absolute bias, which can be obtained only from comparisons with unbiased standard data sets.  For example, wate r vapor and temperature biases are typically constrained through comparisons with in situ observations as from radiosonde.  Such comparisons are usually the responsibility of the data provides, so the analyses described below assume some knowledge of satellite measurement biases An example of comparing component data sets is presented here with a single atmospheric state variable, in this case observed by AIRS \(Atmos pheric Infrared Sounder AMSR-E \(Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS\For this example five variables \(AIRS Total Water column, AMSR-E total water column, AIRS cloud fraction AIRS total water error estimate, AMSR-E liquid water path stemming from two different instruments \(AIRS and AMSR-E\pared and correlated The Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder \(AIRS\he Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer \(AMSR-E\are two instruments aboard the AQUA spacecraft. AMSR-E estimates water vapor over water surfaces and AIRS estimates water vapor over ocean and land. A map of the daily average of terrestrial water vapor column is shown in figure 10. This figure maps th e AIRS estimate of average total \(column\er vapor in mm during March 2003 at a spatial resolution of 1 degree in latitude and longitude  Figure 10. Map of averaged AIRS Total column water vapor for 2003-03   Figure 11. Scatter plot of monthly AIRS and AMSR-E column water vapor. AIRS and AMSR-E water vapor agree very well on the co incident locations  A similar a subset of AMSR-E water vapor over the ocean was prepared with our services and merged with the AIRS dataset at the same spatial and temporal resolutions. A scatter plot of the values estimated with AMSR-E is compared to the collocated va lue of AIRS in figure 11 Figure 11 also shows a red line to mark the location where all points should fall if the AIRS and AMSR-E estimates were the same. The figure shows a tendency by AMSR-E to estimate higher total water vapor than AIRS. However there are locations where AIRS does show higher values. A map of the averaged differences \(AIRS-AMSR-E\15 selected monthly means between the years 2003--2006 is shown in figure 12 This map highlights locations where each instrument tends to overe stimate compared with the other. Blue tones identify regions where AIRS estimates are larger than AMSR-E and shades of brown locate the regions where the opposite is true 


  15  Figure 12. Map of average differences over 15 months between AIRS and AMSR-R water vapor  Figure 12 highlights regions th at are characterized by different hydrological regimes. AIRS overestimates coincide with regions where cold western boundary currents cause frequent cold marine stratocumuli. AMSR-E tends to estimate higher total water vapor in regions characterized by warm sea surface temperatures and frequent convective activity. This result is consistent with previous comparisons    Figure 13. AIRS Total Cloud Fraction sum for 2003-03 Sum over all pressure levels AIRS is an IR measurement that cannot estimate water vapor in regions overcast with optically thick clouds. This property introduces a bias that depends on the cloud fraction. Figure 13 shows an estimate of the cloud fraction using a surrogate for cloud fraction over several AIRS pressure levels. It adds up the cloud fraction at the different levels \(because there may be overlaps, the sum over all pressure levels can be larger than one between the areas with large cloud fraction sums and large AMSR-E overestimates with respect to AIRS and vice versa, areas with the smallest cloud fraction sums coincide with the areas with large AIRS water vapor estimates A proxy for the "thickness" of the clouds in the overcast regions is the liquid water content of such clouds. The advantage of this proxy over others is that it also conveys information about the physical and hydrological characteristics of the scenes co rrelated with the differences Figure 14 shows a PDF of the differences as a function of AIRS water vapor and AMSR-E cloud liquid water path. A black contour line marks the change of sign in the differences. It shows that AIRS estimates higher total water vapor at low liquid water paths with a characteristic quasilinear increase between 5--20 mm. AMSR-E estimates larger total water vapor at 1 x 1 degree regions where the liquid water path is high. The pattern of the differences raises questions about why does AMSR-E estimates differ so quickly from AIRS at low water vapor contents and low liquid water paths  Figure 14.

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
