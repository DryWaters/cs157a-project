Enterprise portal personalization: Dire ct and indirect end-user effects, and the moderating effects of gender   Anders Henriksen University of Agder anders.henriksen@uia.no    Per E. Pedersen University of Agder per.pedersen@uia.no    Abstract  Enterprise portals o ffer rich functionality for enduser personalization, but few studies have been conducted on the end-user effects of this feature. This article presents a study of end-user effects of 
personalization, using the combined technology acceptance model \(TAM\d the theory of planned behaviour \(TPB\ a research framework. We propose that personalization indirectly affects end-users intentions through effects on ease of use, usefulness attitude and behaviour control. In addition, it may have a direct effect on end-usersê intentions to use enterprise portals that is not mediated by the variables of the combined TAM TPB-model. Because previous studies have found gender differences in the use of personalization, we also propose that the effects of personalization are moderated by gender. To test these propositions, a study of the effects of enterprise portal 
personalization in a large Norwegian governmentowned enterprise is reported. Results from applying structural equation mo delling show that personalization has a significant effect on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and perceived behavioural control but no direct effect on end-usersê  intentions to use the enterprise portal Furthermore, the results show that the effects of personalization are moderated by gender. The results have implications for enterprise portal designers, for IS-managers and for further research on personalization of information systems in general 
  1. Introduction  Indicating that Personalization, ...., has been recognized as an important concept in IS research 1  s e v e ral articles h a v e r ecen tl y been p u blish e d i n  leading information systems \(IS\ournals on the subject [1, 2, 3 P e rs on alization is e x pected to  play a significant role in enhancing its customers shopping experience 4, p. 42 d T a m an d Ho s u gg est th at   personalizing ...empowers firms to deliver customer value and to achieve profitable growth 2, p. 2  
What is characteristic of these recent studies, however is that they have been conducted in customer portal or web-site contexts Enterprise portals also offer rich functionality for end-user personalization. Adapting the definition of Smith [5 to o r ga niz a tio na l c o nte x ts Sc he e p e r s 6   suggests that An enterprise portal should provide members of the organization with access to relevant internally and externally sourced information, via a Web-based\ gateway which can be customized and personalized to meet individuals 
specific information requirements  6, p. 63 s s e en  f r o m this def i n i t i on   personalization is a central feature of enterprise portals suggesting that the recent interest in personalization in the IS-literature should also be extended to cover enterprise portal studies Several definitions of personalization have been given in the IS-literature [e.g e appl y t h e  definition by Blom [8 g g e stin g t h at p e rso n al izatio n  is a process that changes the functionality, interface information content, or dis tinctiveness of a system to 
increase its personal relevance to an individual 8, p   Personalization can be performed either by the enduser \(explicit personalization\ or by the system implicit personalization y ste m  w i th ex plici t  personalization typically enables the end-user to change the content, layout, interface, or the functionality of the system. Implicit personalization is conducted in various ways: Profile/group-based personalization, in which the personalization is based on an individual profile, membership or role 
behaviour based personalization, in which the personalization is based on click-streams or end-user behaviour; and, finally, collaborative-based personalization, in which the personalization is based on similar end-users behaviour. For enterprise portals the combination of explicit and profile/group-based personalization is most common Enterprise portal applications come preconfigured to utilize these personalization features, but the ISProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


literature offers relatively little assistance to ISmanagers in how these features can be utilized to stimulate adoption and manage end-user behaviour Thus, empirical studies of personalization effects in organizational contexts are important in filling this knowledge gap From human computer interaction \(HCI\iterature Oulasvirta and Blom o u n d t h at person a lizatio n affects end-users engagement, performance persistence, identity, social acceptance, and social status. Still, they concluded that personalization in organizational contexts has attained little attention in the HCI-domain, and suggest further empirical research. This article represents an effort in this direction, empirically investigating the effects of enterprise portal personalization on traditional antecedents of end-user behaviour In the personalization literature, We oun d  that men and women personalized differently and for different reasons. Thus, it is likely that the effects of personalization also differ systematically by gender By investigating these issues empirically, this article further contributes to a better understanding of personalization as an instrument in stimulating and promoting specific end-user behaviour In the next section we present our research model and hypotheses. In section three, the applied method is presented. In section four, our findings are presented and finally, we give a brief summary of conclusions and limitations, and suggest implications of the results  2 Model and hypotheses  In a recent special issue of the Journal of the Association of Information Systems, technology acceptance research was discussed, and two recommendations were given [12   O n e w a s t o  i n c l ud e  the variables of the theory of planned behaviour \(TPB  s t u d ies of tec h n o lo gy accepta n c e. T h e oth e r was to look at IT-artefacts as antecedents of the constructs of the technology acceptance model \(TAM 14   T h i s st ud y t a ke s t h e r e c o mme nd a t i o n s  fr o m t h i s  discussion seriously by applying the combined TAM/TPB model [15 a res earch f r a m e w or k  an d by  focusing personalization as one of the potential antecedents of the constructs in the combined TAM/TPB-model From numerous technology acceptance studies, we know that that the TPB constructs subjective norm and perceived behaviour control \(PBC\ well as the TAM constructs perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude towards use, are important determinants of end-users intentions to use information systems in organizational contexts [e.g 14, 15 th is s t u d y  w e  f o cu s pers on a lization as o n e  of the antecedents of these variables rather than the effects of these variables on intentions per se. Thus, we investigate how personalization affects end-user behaviour indirectly through its effects on ease of use usefulness, attitude and PBC. Because it is difficult to find theoretical arguments for an effect of personalization on subjective norm, personalization effects on this variable is not focused here. It is however, included in the combined TAM/TPB model that is used as a research framework for this study Furthermore, we suggest that in addition to its mediating effects, personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals directly TPB suggests that an individual s intention to behave is an antecedent of actual behaviour, and that attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norm and PBC are antecedents of this intention. Based on the TPB and on the theory of reasoned action \(TRA Davis introduced the TAM-model [1 th is m odel  perceived ease of use and usefulness are used to explain both attitudes towards use and behavioural intentions to use information systems. In this study, we use the combined TAM/TPB model as a framework for investigating personalization effects Thus we do not discuss all causal paths of the combined TAM/TPBmodel, but focus the effects of personalization and the causal paths of the combined TAM/TPB that are related to the hypothesized effects of personalization In figure 1, our applied version of the combined TAM/TPB-model is illustrated. Potential direct and indirect effects of personalization are illustrated by the paths from perceived personalization \(PP\e independent and dependent constructs of the model Because previous studies have found gender differences in the use of personalization we suggest that the direct and indirect effects of personalization may be moderated by gender. Thus, these moderating effects of gender are also illustrated  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


 Figure 1 Research model Note: EOU = perceived ease of use, USE = perceived usefulness ATT = attitude, PP = perceived personalization, PBC = perceived behaviour control  The model in figure 1 may be used as a basis for hypothesizing individual effects of personalization First, when personalizing enterprise portals, end-users create their own look and feel Thus, it may be easier for the end-users to find information that interests them. Enterprise portal interfaces may be adapted particularly to each end-user s individual behaviour Lin and Wu o u n d that pers on alization h a d a  positive effect on perceived ease of use, and we argue that this finding may also be generalized to workplace information systems. Thus, we propose that H1a: Personalization will influence perceived ease of use of enterprise portals positively  Scheepers u gg es ted th at pers on alizatio n increased the relevance of content, and with increased content relevance, the system was perceived as more useful. Lin and Wu als o f o u n d th at pers on alizatio n influenced perceived usefulness, and, in line with the arguments of generalization used above, we propose that H1b: Personalization will influence perceived usefulness of enterprise portals positively  The effects of personalization on attitudes have been investigated along two lines of reasoning. One has argued that high levels of personalization may affect attitudes negatively due to privacy concerns. The relationship between personalization and privacy has however, been found to be highly sensitive to context 1  m a ki ng u s s u gge st t h a t i n o r ga ni z a t i o na l c o n t e x t s   with high levels of trust, privacy concerns over personalization are not the greatest. Along the other line of reasoning, it has been argued that personalization affects attitudes positively in the same ways as it affects usefulness and ease of use, and empirical support has been found for this T h u s   we propose that H1c: Personalization will influence attitude towards using enterprise portals positively  Technology acceptance studies have found that PBC has a significant effect on end-users intentions to use information technology [19, 20 A ddin g  n e w functionality to information systems may influence the skills required to use the system. Greer and Murtaza  a v e s h o w n t h at PBC related f actors s u c h as Internet experience, influence whether end-users adopt and use personalized websites. Even though personalization in a few cases requires more skills to effectively use the system, we suggest that personalization facilitates the use of the system, and thus, contributes to a higher level of PBC Furthermore, Tafa o u n d th at  w h e n  individuals could choose how to solve a task, they often experienced a sense of personal control, even if the choice had no effect on their actual performance  T h eref ore, w e propos e th at H1d: Personalization will influence perceived behaviour control of enterprise portals positively  In technology acceptance studies applying TAM or TPB, explained variances in intentions to use the systems are often reported in the range from 30% to 50% [e.g  T h u s  m o re t h a n 50 of th e v a rian ce i n  intentions is typically left unexplained applying these models. Examples of concepts that have been shown to have additional direct effects on intentions are trust  joy m ent an d ide n tit y  ex pres s i v e n e s s 25], an d  prior experien e to th e m u lti tu de o f  personalization effects identified by Oulasvirta  and Blom cl u d ing ide n tit y related e f f e cts n o t  included in the combined TAM/TPB-model, it is likely that personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals directly Thus, we propose that H1e: Personalization will influence behavioural intention to use enterprise portals positively  The second set of hypotheses that are investigated in this study considers gender differences in the effects of personalization. Studies have found that the acceptance models of information systems users differ by gender [27, 23 k a t e sh an d Morri s 27] f oun d  that the influence of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and subjective norm on behavioural  Intention EOU USE PBC Subjective norm PP Gender ATT Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


intentions differed by gender. Cheung et al. [23 fo und  that the influence of perceived ease of use on attitudes also differed by gender In addition, studies of personalization have shown that men and women personalize differently Against this background, it is likely that personalization effects may also differ by gender As indicated above, Venkatesh and Morris [27 found that perceived ease of use was more important to female end-users than to male end-users. Thus, female end-users intentions are more strongly influenced by ease of use. Because we propose that personalization affects perceived ease of use positively, we consequently, also propose that H2a: Personalization will influence perceived ease of use more strongly for women than it will for men  Ong and Lai [29 fo und t h a t  ma l e e n d use r s va l u e d  usefulness more strongly than female users. Thus, male end-users intentions are more strongly influenced by usefulness. Because we propose that personalization affects perceived usefulness positively, it is also reasonable to propose that H2b: Personalization will influence perceived usefulness more strongly for men than it will for women  Many of the previous studies of gender differences in technology acceptance have either not included attitu o t hy poth e sized g e n d er diff eren ce s  on the effects of attitud c u rre n t  w i t h t h e s e  studies, we do not propose any gender differences on the effects of personalization on attitudes. Previous studies have, however, found that female users personalize more than male users s e  personalization has been shown to enhance the sense of personal cont e prop os e th at  H2c: Personalization will influence perceived behaviour control more strongly for women than it will for men  In addition to the finding that women personalized more than men, Wells [11 a l so fo und t h a t  personalization influenced women s job satisfaction more positively. Because job satisfaction is among the set of variables possibly contributing to explained variance in intentions to use an enterprise system that is not covered by our applied TAM/TPB-framework we assume that personalization may also affect intentions to use enterprise portals more strongly for those that personalize the most. Consequently, we propose that H2d: Personalization will influence behavioural intentions to use enterprise portals more strongly for women than it will for men  3. Method  To test our hypotheses, a survey was conducted among the 8000 users of an enterprise portal in a Norwegian government-owned enterprise. The enterprise was selected by two criteria: First, the enterprise had participated in an earlier qualitative study on enterprise portal person d  second, management had publicly expressed that personalization was a major priority in their enterprise portal development. The ente rprise portal is based on Microsoft Sharepoint 2003 technology, and it is used as a desktop for the end-users and as an information channel. All end-users have individual My page  start-up pages. This page contains corporate news department news, work task list, collaboration room list, favourites, project rooms and other less frequently used items. The survey focused on the My page and thus, the personalization of the My page was used as the stimulus and context of the study  3.1 Instrument  To measure perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, PBC, subjective norm and intentions to use the enterprise portal, we use standard items from the IS-literature that are well tested \(see appendix A for wording of the items\he items except for the attitude construct, we used 5-point scales ranging from Strongly disagree 1 Strongly agree 5\To measure attitudes we used three standard 5-point bipolar scales A ll t h e  m e a s u r e s  w e re  designed as reflective. Variables were computed as the weighted average of construct items using the factor loadings of a confirmatory factor analysis \(CFA\he measurement model as weights To study the effects of personalization, the construct may be manipulated by providing different informants with different personalization strategies and then analyse the effects of these manipulations Alternatively perceived personalization may be measured using multiple measures and applied as an independent variable in the same way as the constructs of the combined TAM/TPB model. We decided to use the latter method to measure how the informants perceived the personalization of the enterprise portal The origin of this construct is found in a qualitative study of web-shop super-users Percei v e d personalization has been used in behavioural studies of mobile comm e bs i t e s 31, 33 an d ado p tion  of recommendation agents Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


Based on these studies, a measurement inventory of perceived personalization was developed and pretested among 147 informants in the same Norwegian government-owned enterprise as that of the main study. Based on the pre-study, a compact and parsimonious scale of perceived personalization was developed including the six items shown in appendix A. All items were systematically grouped using an online questionnaire application and made available to respondents online  3.2 Procedure and sample  Participants were recruited using banner announcements on the My page of the enterprise portal. A gift card drawing was used to stimulate recruitment. After one week, 450 respondents had participated, and at this point the banner was moved to the right side border of the enterprise portal After two weeks, the banner was removed from the enterprise portal, and survey recruitment was closed Now, 773 respondents had answered the whole or parts of or the complete questionnaire. When compared to the number of end-users accessing the enterprise portal during the period, this gives us a response rate of 10 which is comparable with similar, recently published online survey studies [e.g. 35   Of the 773 respondents, 15 were removed as extreme outliers, 20 were empty responses, 75 had only finished the first page of the questionnaire, 3 had unrealistic answers on quantitative control items \(e.g the number of hours that My page was used whereas 13 were removed because they had used less than 5 minutes to complete the survey. Using less than 5 minutes was considered an indication of careless response. This gave a final sample of 647 responses to be used in further data analysis. Sample characteristics are shown in table 1  Table 1 Sample characteristics Gender Male 44.6 Female 55.4 Age 0 - 19 0.4 20 29 9.3 30 39 22.5 40 49 39.5 50 59 24.8 60 or more 3.6  When comparing sample characteristics with the characteristics of the enterprise portal user population the sample seemed representative, with an age distribution concentrated between 30 and 59, and with a percentage of female respondents of 55.4  4. Results  We used Amos 7.0 to test our measurement and structural models. We apply the recommended reporting structure of Henriksen and Pedersen  and report model fit for measurement model and structural model, as well as important measurement reliability and validity indicators To assess the reliability of the variables, we report construct reliability \(CR\nd Cronbach s alpha. As seen from Table 2, all variables have Cronbach s alpha above 0.7, and all measures except PBC, have CR above 0.7. CR for this variable is close to 0.7, and Hair  t ate t h at CR  bet w ee n 0.6 an d 0.7 i s  acceptable provided that other indicators are good  Table 2 Reliability and convergent validity Item CR Number of items EOU 0.94 0.80 4 USE 0.94 0.80 4 ATT 0.89 0.72 3 PBC 0.86 0.69 3 SUB 0.88 0.70 3 PP 0.93 0.72 6 INT 0.89 0.74 3 Note: CR=construct reliability  To ensure construct validity, we also assess convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity is assessed investigating factor loadings of a CFA of the measurement model and the variances extracted. Variances extracted are reported along the diagonal of Table 3. Applying the criteria of Hair et al  e  s ee t h at v a ria n ces e x t r acted are w e ll abov e t h e  recommended 0.5 for all measures In Appendix A, the factor loadings of the CFA are reported. All factor loadings are well above 0.7, and consequently, we conclude that convergent validity is acceptable. To assess discriminant validity, we apply the principles of Hair et al p arin g  v a ria n ces  extracted with inter-construct squared correlations. In Table 3, correlations between model constructs are reported \(below the diagonal\g with the squared correlations \(above the diagonal\en comparing squared correlations with the variances extracted along the diagonal\we find that all variances extracted are higher than the squared correlations indicating acceptable discriminant validity  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

The complete model accounts for 41% of the variance in PBC, 56% of the variance in usefulness, 51% of the variance in ease of use, 77% of the variance in attitude and 39% of the variance in the intention to use the enterprise portal. From figure 2, we can se that the paths from ease of use to usefulness and attitude, and the path from usefulness to attitude are significant. The paths from PBC, usefulness and subjective norm to intention are all significant, showing their positive influences on the intention to use enterprise portals The pattern of significant paths and explained variances of the combined TAM/TPB-model do not deviate considerably from what one would expect to find in technology acceptance studies of information systems in organizational contexts Turning to the hypotheses that are the main scope of this study, we find that the paths from personalization to ease of use, usefulness, attitude and PBC are all positive and significant. This supports hypotheses H1a, H1b, H1c and H1d. Thus personalization has a significant positive effect on the antecedents of intention to use enterprise portals. The direct path from personalization to intention, however is not significant. Thus we find no support for hypothesis H1e. This means that all the effects of personalization on intention to use enterprise portals in this study are mediated by ease of use, usefulness attitudes towards use and PBC The hypotheses 2a-2d propose that the effects of enterprise portal personalization are moderated by gender. To test these hypotheses, we use the procedure for invariance testing originally presented by Bollen  d applied f o r m u lti g r o u p an al y s is, i n th e sa m e  way as we apply it here, by Cheung  T h e procedure includes conducting tests of the differences in 2 when comparing the base model where all paths were freely estimated to the constrained model where one path coefficient was constrained to be equal across the two groups 23, p. 478    Figure 2 Structural model.

 First, models were estimated freely for the male and female groups. The model fits well for male users  2= 617.8, df = 286, CFI = 0.94, NFI = 0.89 RMSEA=0.070 \(\(90% CI = 0.063, 0.078\The model accounts for 55% of the variance in usefulness, 36% of the variance in PBC, 44% of the variance in ease of use, 80% of the variance in attitude, and 44% of the variance in intention to use the enterprise portal. The paths between personalization and usefulness, PBC and ease of use are all significant. For female users, the model also fits well 2= 660.8, and df = 286, CFI 0.94, NFI = 0.90, RMSEA=0.067 \(\(90% CI = 0.060 0.074\The model accounts for 57% of the variance in usefulness, 48% of the variance in PBC, 60% of the variance in ease of use, 74% of the variance in attitude and 35% of the variance in intention to use the enterprise portal. Thus, we see that it is somewhat more difficult to explain the intentions of the female end-users than the male end-users. In this model the paths from personalization to ease of use, usefulness attitude, and PBC are all significant Turning to the hypotheses 2a-2d, we conducted 2difference tests using the procedure for multi-group analysis presented above. The results are presented in Table 4, showing which of the path coefficients that was held constant during estimation, the difference in 2 and the degrees of freedom of the test From Table 4 we see that only the paths between personalization and ease of use 2=7.56, p<0.01\d between personalization and PBC 2=5.58, p<0.05 are significantly different for male and female endusers. Thus, personalization affects ease of use and PBC differently for male and female end-users  Table 4 Multi group analysis Hypotheses Path 2 diff d.f Supported or not H2a PP -> EOU 7.56 1 Supported H2b PP -> USE 0.90 1 Not supported H2c PP -> PBC 5.58 1 Supported H2d PP -> INT 1.22 1 Not supported Note: * and ** indicate significance at p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively  In addition to propositions on general gender differences, hypotheses 2a-2d also propose specific directions of these differences. The path between personalization and ease of use \(see figure 2\ows that personalization influences ease of use more for female 0.91, p<0.01\han for male 0.66 p<0.01\d-users. This finding supports hypothesis H2a that female users perception of ease of use is more influenced by personalization. Personalization also influences PBC more for female 0.71, p<0.01 than for male 0.49, p<0.01\d-users. Thus hypotheses H2c is also supported. Since none of the other 2-difference tests are significant, hypotheses H2b and H2d are not supported. Even if we did not theoretically propose a specific gender difference in the effect of personalization on attitudes towards use, a 2test of this difference could be interesting. It, however also turned out not significant 2=0.73, d.f.=1 Thus, we can conclude that for 4 hypotheses on gender differences in the effects of personalization, 2 are found significant. Both of these suggest stronger effects of personalization among female end-users than among male end-users. Consequently, we generally conclude that female end-users are more affected by personalization of enterprise portals than male endusers. A summary of the hypothesis testing results is shown in Appendix B  5. Conclusions  Previous research on personalization suggests indirect, direct and modera ted effects of enterprise portal personalization. Through a comprehensive study of enterprise portal personalization in a Norwegian government-owned enterprise, we found that ease of use, usefulness, attitudes towards use and behavioural control are influenced positively by personalization. In addition, we found some of these effects to be moderated by gender, suggesting that female users are more positively influenced by personalization than male users. This shows, as proposed by Scheepers that personalization is an important feature for enterprise portals. In addition, our findings contribute to a better understanding of what personalization does to end-users perceptions of enterprise portals and how it affects end-users behaviour Our conclusions are naturally limited, mainly by external validity. Whereas we have shown the internal validity of the study to be good, the study may be criticized for lack of external validity due to particularities in the personalization operation, the enterprise portal operation and the specific sample characteristics of our study. Still, we argue that the personalization operation using a My page is very typical to many enterprise portal applications. We also argue that the enterprise portal application used in this study is one of the most widespread globally. The level and variance in the perceived personalization measure also support our arguments that end-users perceived different levels of personalization for the studied enterprise portal. Furthermore, sample characteristics have been reported to en able validation of potential bias in sample demographics that may have affected Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


our findings in an invalidating way. It can also be argued that the relatively high average age of our respondents may influence our results, but we have conducted a multi-group analysis with age as a moderator, using the same procedure as for gender reported above. This analysis, applying a median split of the age variable, revealed no significant differences in any personalization effects between the age groups Thus, we argue that if done with care and consideration for differences in end-user characteristics, our conclusions may be generalized to other enterprise portal implementations The current study shows that the combined TAM/TPB-model may be used as a research framework for effectively studying the effects of ITartefacts like personalization. This implies that further investigation of the effects of personalization may apply to and extend from the combined TAM/TPBframework used here. It is also likely that more moderating effects may be identified in further studies of the effects of personalization, for example by experience, or by organizational roles Findings in this study also have implications for enterprise portal designers and for IS-managers implementing enterprise portals. Because personalization is shown to have positive effects on ease of use, usefulness, attitude towards use and behavioural control, financial and attentional investments in providing enterprise portals with rich personalization features are substantiated. Our results showing that the effects of personalization features affects male and female end-users differently, also indicate that designers and IS-managers that implement enterprise portals should take into consideration which elements of the portal to personalize, and most importantly, for which user categories should personalization be most comprehensive. Further research on effect differences between user categories is required, but personalization of the kind investigated in this study is something that should be focused particularly in organizations with a majority of female employees to stimulate an d promote enterprise portal use  6.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
