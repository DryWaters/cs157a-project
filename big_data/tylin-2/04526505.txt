Developing the Process Tools and Software Architecture for the PnPSat Initiative Kenneth B Center Design_Net Engineering LLC 10311 W Hampden Service Road A107 Lakewood CO 80227 303-462-0096 kcenter design-group.com Abstract Over the past few years the Air Force Research Laboratories in Albuquerque New Mexico have been leading the charge to establish a new paradigm for the satellite development process Central to this development is the Space Plug&play Avionics SPA standards which define standard electrical data and mechanical interfaces for all components that are used to construct the system 
Components consist of both hardware and software elements all capable of being integrated and tested rapidly to create functional capability It is envisioned that with the diligence being applied it will ultimately be possible to draw from stock items at a depot to design assemble and launch a satellite in a matter of days An essential enabling aspect of the process is a collection of highly interoperable software modules conforming to the data portion of the SPA standards which can be selected from a library based upon their 
ability to collectively meet a set of prescribed mission objectives If properly constructed the modules can self-configure on the data network ideally without human intervention or modification'2 Abolishing the segment of the satellite life cycle associated with the development of flight software is one of the most critical goals to achieve if the six-day-satellite concept is to become reality Design Net Engineering has been active in the refinement of these standards as well as a primary contributor to the development of a flight software 
architecture to validate the approach We have also created a development environment that takes advantage of the network-based data standards to allow code to be written and tested without physical hardware This capability termed Flight Software In the Loop FSWIL utilizes a robust simulation framework to present behavioral models of hardware devices to the software developer that are indistinguishable from the actual articles The PnPSat program is an initiative that has been established by AFRL to serve as a technology demonstration for the SPA standards Due to the fact that many 
of the core technologies were being matured in parallel it became necessary to develop the FSWIL capability to allow software efforts to progress without a supporting hardware infrastructure The tools have 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

FSWIL tool as well as the SPA-based flight software architecture and implementation products that support the PnPSat program TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1 2 SPA AS AN ORS ENABLER  2 3 MODULAR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE 3 4 AUTONOMY OBJECTIVES 4 5 THE MSDT TOOLCHAIN 5 6 INTEGRATED SIMULATION FOR AI&T 6 7 CONCLUSIONS  7 REFERENCES  7 BIOGRAPHY  8 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND In recent years Design Net Engineering DNet has been exceedingly 
active in the Operationally Responsive Space ORS arena Our efforts have been broadencompassing systems engineering efforts to understand the bottlenecks to rapid space access development of responsive avionics design of a modular power architecture the creation of an end-to-end coordinated design and test environment for tactical satellites and the development of modular software in a data-centric architecture to facilitate seamless interoperability between spacecraft hardware components and flight code All of these enablers have been brought together on the PnPSat program Although the primary objective 
of PnPSat is to demonstrate and qualify the supporting technologies it is also setting the stage for the six-day-satellite concept The target missions for this process are small tactical satellites in the 150-400kg class which can be assembled using modular structural bus panels with self-contained data and electrical infrastructure and bolt-on commodity support components and avionics The hope is that these standards will demonstrate viability and gain acceptance not just for this limited tactical mission class but for rapid and affordable access to space in general 1 


2 SPA AS AN ORS ENABLER AFRL has its sights set on becoming a leader in innovative approaches to Operationally Responsive Space ORS especially with respect to tactical satellites ORS is all about getting desired capability on-orbit rapidly and affordably This is of particular importance to the joint forces given the current global security climate Placing fine-tuned tactical capability in space has the advantage of being able to service globally distributed theatres on the timescale of hours or days while overcoming the restricted airspace dilemma that near-ground assets face The AFRL-conceived six-day-satellite initiative seeks to develop the capability to provide rapid call-up of tactical space-borne assets where the need for an on-orbit capability can be requested designed assembled and tested in a streamlined depotoriented process That satellite may then be responsively integrated with the launch vehicle launched deployed checked-out on-orbit and ready for service all within a six day window Accomplishing this requires that the parts that comprise a satellite can be rapidly determined assembled and validated without ambiguity The SPA standards act to enforce compatibility between pieces while selection and assembly of these pieces is facilitated by an integrated extensible process toolchain called MSDT that will be described in later sections Figure 1 PnPSat a completely SPA-based spacecraft Meeting the described modular assembly goals requires defining data and communication standards electrical standards structural mounting standards and the encapsulation of each system component's interface definition in an electronic form that allows the system and other components to understand and determine how to support its capabilities These issues all of which promote the component-oriented compatibility that is essential to rapid assembly and guaranteed operability are central to the SPA standards that AFRL has developed in the past few years All of these elements of the standard have been defined and are actively being exercised primarily through efforts in the Responsive Space Testbed and with the PnPSat program Figure 1 shows the design of PnPSat which is built entirely of SPA-based technology hardware and software The intent of this paper is not to describe these standards in detail but to provide perspective on how the data standards in particular are being employed to allow flight software to be highly re-usable and adapt to the physical configuration of the satellite The Satellite Data Model SDM 1 is a middleware software solution that along with the Space Plug-and-Play PnP Avionics SPA standards allows spacecraft components and applications to be discovered and their data registered in a data-centric architecture The intent of this technology is to allow modular software elements to carry their own Interface Control Document ICD mitigating the need for the type of implementation-specific development that has traditionally plagued flight software The ICD is expressed in XML format and carries all of the information needed to allow applications in the flight system to make use of the described component An xTEDS contains primarily three categories of information identity characterization and data interface definitions The identity of the component consists of information such as the name of the component the type of device or application the manufacturer or author model serial numbersimply the data that allows a component to be uniquely distinguished in an inventory Since the xTEDS is retained in non-volatile memory along with a device or as compiled-in data for an application the opportunity exists to download this information from the component as it sits in a depot thus alleviating the need to maintain a paper traveler The second category of data is characterizing information which can consists of bulk performance parameters maximum torque and momentum storage capacity are examples in the case of a reaction wheel limits and calibrations The characterizing information distinguishes components of a similar class from one another in terms of capability This information is important because it allows system applications to adapt to the capabilities of the resources that it finds As an example control gains in an attitude determination and control subsystem may be set based upon the capabilities of the components that it finds during initialization The final function of xTEDS is the definition of the data interfaces This occurs at three levels At the lowest level is the variable The definition must include a name string the kind of data temperature angular rate magnetic flux vector etc the data representation its scaling units legal ranges The standard unit of data exchange in SPA is the message which aggregates a number of variables into a logical container Messages reference variables defined in the xTEDS and also specify the conditions by which the message may be delivered selectable rates polled versus periodic When a component subscribes to data from another entity in the 2 


system the data is transmitted at the message level Messages come in several varieties data messages which are exclusively produced by a device commands which carry parameterized data into a component with no expectation of a response and requests which are two-way sequential communications command-response style The final logical encapsulation of data that the xTEDS defines is that of interfaces Interfaces are a collection of messages that relate to a coherent set of capability The typical organization of interfaces is along functional boundaries such as device power sensor configuration and measurement and device housekeeping To date xTEDS have been authored for approximately seventy-five spacecraft support devices and applications The delivery of this ICD at discovery time also allows components to be accommodated and validated in the flight architecture as soon as they are attached to a live bus significantly speeding functional checkout and initial integration activities The software side of the SPA standard largely defines how data is discovered and exchanged in a network-oriented satellite infrastructure The electronic ICDs mentioned in the paragraph above are referred to as eXtensible Transducer Electronic Data Sheets xTEDS They provide the basis for defining the identity of a component in the system be it hardware or a software module its characteristics the types and kinds of data elements that are exchanged in messaging the format of those messages and definitions of component data interfaces that aggregate a collection of input and output messages to standardize access to a device or portion of a device For a GPS there may be a spacecraft position interface time interface device power interface and possibly an attitude interface if the particular hardware possesses that capability It is important to understand that software applications in this data-centric paradigm also have xTEDS and that they are in the network sense indistinguishable from a piece of hardware The same benefits of data organization and interface characterization that ease the integration of a spacecraft support component into the system also extend to incorporating a software module that performs a role in support of spacecraft operations for example an algorithm application that subscribes to all data of a certain kind and calculates statistical variations Integration of these types of drop-in soft modules is monumentally eased in a networkoriented architecture We anticipate that these fresh approaches to software will be industry-standard once embraced by the larger space community especially as they are essentially a reflection of the direction that terrestrial computing has taken through the course of the networkcomputing era 3 MODULAR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE Better software approaches are critical to realizing a shorter call-up to service time window for tactical space assets The traditional software development cycle for spacecraft is one of the greatest barriers to achieving responsive space objectives because of typically low code re-use and methodical time consuming testing methodologies SPA seeks to implement a new paradigm for software in which software exists in modular fashion in an assembly depot alongside PnP hardware If a satellite is to be conceived assembled tested launched and checked-out in six days there is no time to write and test code it has to already exist If software components can be considered to be pre-validated stock items building a functional satellite system then only requires determining the proper collection of pieces to meet the mission needs and loading it into the system with the matching complement of hardware This can be achieved because the data architecture is networkbased and because discovery techniques allow all data providers and consumers to find each other without the need for human-guided configuration Determining the required software applications and reconciling the dependencies between components are then the only remaining problems to solve and those are accomplished using the design tools that will be discussed in later sections There are essentially three major layers in the PnPSat software architecture helper applications subsystem controllers and activity agents Helper applications serve to reduce the data from PnP devices to data that has utility in space system context As an example PnPSat hosts several coarse sun sensor assembly devices each of which hosts four sensors The device ASIM provides a cosine value for each of the heads in the assembly in routine data messages to any interested subscriber but it also provides sensor boresites in the device's reference frame as static data during the discovery phase The CoarseSunSensorSolution application is an example of a helper It subscribes to all instances of coarse sun sensor CSS that it finds in the system then utilizes orientation information obtained from each device's xTEDS along with each individual head's boresite to resolve the sensor signal into the spacecraft body coordinate frame The application then sorts received CSS head data messages by signal intensity and uses the highest three values to determine a sun line of sight LOS unit vector in spacecraft body frame This data item is of fundamental utility to the satellite It is usable by a variety of resources in the system and is understood without ambiguity Other applications in the system may calculate this quantity as well and expose it in an xTEDS For example if ephemeris and spacecraft attitude are both available a Celestial Almanac component may also deliver Sun LOS Multiple instances of a specific system context quantity are highly 3 


desirable because it facilitates data robustness fault tolerance and graceful degradation Subsystem controllers are applications that map to traditionally understood subsystem roles in a space system These include for PnPSat Attitude Determination and Control Power Management Communications Thermal Management and Payload/Experiment Support The intent of the subsystem controllers is to roll up the capabilities of the devices and helper applications that facilitate the functional aspects of each of these subsystem roles Using ADCS again as an example the ADCS Controller exposes a standard interface to monitor and command the various modes that ADCS supports nadir mode slewing target pointing It also provide a planning interface to assist in the prediction of power consumption and duration associated with a requested maneuver to be used by the mission activity agents The ADCS Controller makes use of the device and helper application data interfaces discovered at run time to accomplish its mission-level role It is important to note that the controllers are static software modules that never change from mission to mission They are designed to make use of whatever spacecraft support devices and helper applications are discovered to accomplish ADCS activities Each mission may be built from different components and to different performance requirements but so long as those components expose xTEDS with recognizable characterizing syntax for data kinds the interface to the core space system remains the same Residing at the top of the SPA software architecture are Activity Agents These software applications interact primarily with the Subsystem Controllers using their interfaces to accomplish mission operations Activities are coordinated by an Activity Manager that coordinates the timelining and concurrency of various mission activities The Activity approach to operations has been implemented largely to meet the need for tactical spacecraft autonomous operations Additional details are provided in the next section 4 AUTONOMY OBJECTIVES Autonomy is the ability of a satellite to accomplish its intended mission objectives with minimal or no intervention from the ground Autonomous operations are a key part of the Air Force's vision for ORS because an effective tactical satellite squadron best serves objectives when technology allows them to be tasked and coordinated from the ops center in mission context in terms of objectives not having to worry about the routine aspects of spacecraft command and control This can be accomplished effectively with on-orbit autonomy using the more capable processors that are currently under development Rome Lab's Wafer Scale Signal Processor WSSP and DNet's Reconfigurable Processor Board RPB are examples Extra processing and better more configurable approaches to flight software will offer the opportunity to push much of the processing and routine operations out to the spacecraft itself offloading the ops center and making satellites much more operationally responsive an obvious benefit to an everincreasing arsenal of tactical space assets Interface to Ground Station Software Figure 2 Flight Software in the Loop configuration DNet has been working closely with AFRL on autonomy software on the PnPSat program We have developed with other team members an approach to spacecraft autonomy that characterizes and conducts satellite operations relative to activities These activities can be related to general stationkeeping i.e care and feeding of the satellite or to more mission-specific operations such as tactical data collection or information processing Regardless of the nature of an activity it is always supported and constrained by spacecraft resources available processing power thermal state attitude and orbit determination and control and target proximity That support is under the control of the individual spacecraft subsystems EPS COM ADCS GNC Thermal Each of these categories is supported by a subsystem manager or controller that interacts with the requisite hardware elements of the system to provide capability Each of these subsystems has a planning interface that is a standard interface by which the activities can query the resources of one subsystem as they 4 


relate to accomplishing the activity goal and then vet the responses against the availability of those resources from other subsystems Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchy of applications within a SPA-based data centric architecture with the Activity Agent Layer at the bottom These agents after using planning to determine a suitable execution window such as when a desired ground target is available to satisfy an imaging request interact with the scheduler called the Activity Manager to negotiate insertion into the mission timeline A priority scheme is employed to reconcile time conflicts between competing activities DNet is working on several activity agents to support the PnPSat mission including Deploy Charge Batteries Shed Loads TakeImage Manage Momentum Temperature Mitigation Commissioning and Laser Threat Response Each is being developed and tested using the FSWIL capabilities that are described in later sections The effort to tune the activity priorities to maximize the ability to meet mission objectives while maintaining the health and safety of the satellite is currently underway With the FSWIL toolkit those trades may be run in hyper-time allowing months of mission time with a particular satellite configuration to be assessed in days 5 THE MSDT ToOLCHAIN DNet has been developing the Mission and Satellite Design Tool MSDT for the Responsive Space Testbed at Air Force Research Laboratories in Albuquerque MSDT is one element in a chain of integrated capability supporting the Responsive Satellite cell of the Testbed It is a technicianlevel tool designed to isolate the user from the system engineering details of satellite design It must be understood that MSDT is not intended to be an engineering tool in its envisioned end form engineering analysis tools are to be recruited by the framework as needed during the configuration process to apply the captured systems expertise The goal is not to build an arbitrary optimized spacecraftit is to rapidy configure a satellite within a specific and bounded tactical mission class using a well understood and limited set of components The analogy is a tailored automotive assembly line or Dell style PC assembly line where expressed customer desires may be satisfied using the latest technology components and assembled very rapidly The core MSDT engine provides a point of data collection and management for the user to accept high-level mission objectives subsequently drawing from a centrally managed database of capability to determine a collection of spacecraft support components that can satisfy the derived satellite system requirements It is important to understand that in the realm of rapidly configurable PnP-style satellites payloads or experiment modules are also merely components If the mission objectives dictate the need for specific communications imaging or other sensing the appropriate experiment modules are selected from the depot inventory This is a philosophical shift from the traditional view of the spacecraft as the carrier for payloads In PnP all components are aggregated to compose a functional system Each component available for inclusion in a satellite's design exists in a central depot database Every item is characterized in terms of its relevant system utility physical/operating characteristics and performance This characterizing information is used by MSDT to deduce its configurations Figure 3 details the MSDT support infrastructure that is currently in development at the RST The innards of MSDT employ a rules-based constraint engine that applies relationships at the level of Microcosm's venerable Spacecraft Mission and Design SMAD relationships 2 to guide the process of component selection MSDT is guided not solely by SMAD logic but also by high-fidelity assessment capability coupled to simulation and the assistance of time-honored engineering tools such as SINDA which provide feedback in the form of

Functional Block Diagram Once a suitable configuration has been achieved through use of the solver and various high-fidelity design tools the support role turns toward integration and test Electronic products are exported that describe the satellite including a build list of components with their packaging configuration of the test environment for the verification process and a load of modular software that can meet the expressed mission objectives For the early verification process the software load is distributed to a flight processor stand-in while the spacecraft configuration is dispatched to a simulation framework that exposes high-fidelity behavioral models of the spacecraft devices MSDT also configures the simulator for mission scenarios allowing the primary operational objectives to be rapidly assessed Use of the assessment tools allows the performance of the spacecraft to be measured The metrics obtained termed 5 


Measures of Performance MOPs are then returned to MSDT to be compared against the derived mission requirements This feedback loop is an essential component of the integrated toolflow It allows the process flow to be improved with utilization The correspondence between performance and configuration is used to improve the fidelity of the MSDT rules and constraints that are used to configure missions Because of the composition of the process tools this training happens at all stages of the process from early design activities even trade studies through flight by virtue of seamless integration with the ground station software It is imperative to note that even at this early stage the actual flight software modules are being used to support the assessment exercises This allows a degree of confidence in system interoperability much earlier in the process than has been previously possible with traditional approaches Once the early assessment process has been completed MSDT exports the Bill Of Materials BOM for fabrication of the actual satellite from SPA-compatible modular panels and hardware devices The mechanical and electrical standards result in an extremely rapid assembly of the satellite When complete or even if only partially complete the satellite may be subjected to Hardware-In-The Loop testing by use of the same simulation framework to drive the components within the flight system by injecting environmentally-influenced data into the registers of each hardware support device using a Test-Bypass protocol As a result the flight system is rapidly and effectively put through functional testing that closely resembles flight conditions At this point the MSDT framework provides operator scripts and autonomous Activity Agents that allow the spacecraft to be exercised in Day-In-The-Life or Week-In-The-Life scenarios providing for final validation of the configuration using the flight parts and software MSDT is an extensible framework At the current time modules exist to facilitate the design process in the areas of orbit selection attitude determination and control thermal analysis power analysis and launch vehicle selection as shown in Figure 3 The Air Force plans to add capability to the toolchain in additional areas such as coupled loads structural analysis considerations in the near future to round out system domain areas It is important to explain although it is out of the scope of this paper that one of the objectives of SPA is to define standards for infrastructure components and pluggable devices that will naturally result in a system that does not suffer from some of the issues that consume system engineering resources in typical programs As an example the SPA modular power infrastructure and the electrical requirements levied on SPA-compatible components inherently mitigate grounding and electromagnetic issues 6 INTEGRATED SIMULATION FOR AI&T One of the essential elements of the RST process infrastructure is the simulation capability that supports the development life cycle Star Technologies Spacecraft Dynamic Tool SDT 3 is a component-oriented framework that allows space simulations to be configured rapidly and monitored using impressive 3D visualization It has at its core a high-fidelity six degree of freedom dynamics engine that interacts with robust behavioral models of spacecraft support resources to provide an excellent capability to integrate seamlessly with a larger component-oriented architecture We take advantage of SDT to provide measures of performance that are used to verify the ability of a candidate spacecraft configuration to meet its intended mission objectives The same SDTresident component behavioral models also facilitate both Flight Software in the Loop FSWIL and Hardware in the Loop HWIL testing with a simple reconfiguration of realtime messages Figure 4 shows a sample screenshot of the effective design support presentation that SDT provides to the integrated toolchain Figure 4 SDT used for AI&T Simulation Support One of the more powerful capabilities that we have developed around the SDT framework is the ability to attach SDT-resident behavioral models of spacecraft support components to a Remote Sensor Manager This RSM compatible with a data centric architecture allows a Data Manager component running on a flight system to discover and subscribe to data from those components as if they were actually hosted on a local processor This powerful capability allows SDT to present extremely robust representations of virtual elements of a data-centric architecture to applications and real hardware being developed or tested This Flight Software In the Loop FSWIL capability provides an easily configurable means of testing the xTEDS representations of spacecraft support devices that are so critical to moving forward the ability to truly achieve PnP in the data sense that is structuring the description and names of data elements such that they are interpretable and usable by applications such as a modular 6 


attitude control architecture or an autonomy agent that find them during the discovery process Once early validation of the software system against simulation models is complete and the physical flight system is assembled from PnP components integrated simulation support transitions to a Hardware in the Loop HWIL mode In this configuration the simulation device models exchange xTEDS-level interface data with the ASIMs which provide a test-bypass mode in which registers may be managed by simulation instead of by the physical hardware itself The flight software makes the transition from a proxy to the actual flight processor\(s residing on the SPA physical network Spacewire-based for PnPSat Importantly the flight software remains unchanged All that remains to be assessed is the ability of the software to meet deadlines and the network-based messaging communications between components to properly handle differences in transport latencies In the PnPSat program we are now at the point of quantifying these differences but preliminary results indicate that there are not substantial differences when relocating software between the FSWIL and HWIL configurations REFERENCES 1 Cannon S Responsive Space Plug  Play with the Satellite Data Model Proc AIAA Infotech 2007 Conference Rohnert Part CA May 2007 2 Wiley J Larson and James R Wertz Space Mission Analysis and Design 3rd Edition Microcosm Press 1999 3 R Strunce F Eckert C Eddy Responsive Space's Spacecraft Design Tool SDT AIAA Fourth Responsive Space Conference 2006 7 CONCLUSIONS Design Net has provided extensive support to the Air Force's Operationally Responsive Space research efforts providing key support in several areas that facilitate the ability to configure and deploy tactical space assets within improbably short periods of time We have used the SPA data standards and a novel autonomy architecture to develop modular application code that can organically connect at runtime on a data network to provide desired missionoriented capability This approach shows great promise for building an inventory of stock software elements that can be used to rapidly assemble capability for a limited class of satellites The MSDT toolchain facilitates control of the end-to-end satellite life cycle leveraging from the SPA standards to enable design analysis assembly testing verification and on-orbit command and control of this new class of satellites The first test of this technology will be the PnPSat mission which seeks to demonstrate the viability of these approaches and the enabling technologies and standards upon which they are built PnPSat is moving toward launch readiness in the middle of 2008 7

The transformation from a beamrelative detection to an antenna-relative detection must include this uncertainty in both the sine-space values and their uncertainty.  Instrumentation noise on a dwell-bydwell basis can be modeled as a difference between the desired beam point position and the true beam point position If the instrumentation noise is specified as a percentage of the radar\222s resolution, detection-primitive values are 26\where dp,b is a detection-primitive value relative to the beam, dp,a is a detection-primitive value relative to the antenna n i is the resolution percent i s a uni form random  variable over the interval -\275 to \275.

The first step uses antenna patterns to calculate values for the monopulse ratio y I  versus DOA.

This assumption is reasonably accurate for rectangul ar apertures but less so for circular apertures.

Clustering selects detection primitives and centroiding combines clustered primitive data into a measurement.  The model presented here makes certain assumptions about the process that created the detection primitives.  For example, the model assumes a rectangular shaped ambiguity function cut and an exact c 2 f BW sampling interval.  Even with this simple detection model, closel y-spaced targets, false alarms and missed detections, clustering can be a challenge The simple model of clustering used for the simulated results first thresholds detection primitives based on the observed SNR R o culated by \(24\ to a threshold 27 Detectio n p r im itiv es th at rem ain  are clu s tered  an d  centroided based the number of consecutive range-cell indices occupied.  The simple clustering model considers three cases: a detection primitive with no range-cell-index neighbors, a pair of detecti on primitives with no neighbors except each other, and three or more consecutive range-cell indices.  These three cluster classes are shown in Figure 6 where they are named isolated pair, and CSO, respectively Centroiding treats each of th ese three cases differently Isolated Pair CSO Isolated Pair CSO  Figure 6 - Cluster cases For isolated clusters, the assumption of no additional information is used to produce a centroided measurement with values identical to the detection primitive.  Intuition about the uncertainty of an isolated cell seems to be at odds with this approach.  For example, if the SNR is high, the likelihood of the target being near the center of the range cell should also be high.  Th e assumption of no additional information seems to hold only when the cell\222s SNR is low and close to the detection threshold.  It turns out that 2 3 k D  can be used to examine algorith ms for the isolated-cell case and one of the examples looks at this problem CSO clusters violate the model assumption that target energy will spread to at most two consecutive range cells Thus, the cluster must contai n two or more closely-spaced targets or one target and a false alarm.  CSO clusters produce the same number of measurements as the number of detection primitives in the cluster and use values identical to the corresponding detection primitives.  Measurements from a CSO cluster are flagge d so that the tracker can differentiate between measurements from single-target clusters and CSO clusters.  Different rules govern how these measurements are used by th e tracker.  For example, the tracker may be allowed to in itiate and update a so-called CSO track with a CSO-cluster measurement but it may not be allowed to update a non-CSO track with a CSO-cluster measurement For pair clusters, the data in both detection primitives are used to produce a single centroided measurement and measurement variance.  The centroided measurement is simply the SNR weighted centroid of the two detection primitives expressed by \(27   1 2,,2,1,,1 2,,2,1,1 2,2,1,1 2,1     10            12 2 1 2 1  2 1 2 1  2 1 2 1      212 212 212  r r r r r r r+\r  adpy,oadp,yo adp,xoadp,,xo adp,oadp,o oo amy amx am k k k k R R k k R 27 27 The centroided variance is more involved because the same instrumentation noise is used for all detection primitives Subtracting the instrumentation noise variances from the antenna-relative detection primitives results in the same beam-relative variances used in \(26\roided standard deviations are calculated in \(28\Finally, \(29 adds in the instrumentation noise  r+\r r r r+\r r r r+\r r r  2,1 2 1 2,1 2 1 2,1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1    2 oo ko ko oo ko ko oo ko ko k k R bdp,y bdp,y bdp,x bdp,x bdpx bdp,x bmy bmx bm  resykyi resxkxi resRi k k R k k R kn kn Rn bdp,y bdp,x bdp adp,y adp,x adp  resykyi resxkxi resRi k k R k k R kn kn Rn bmy bmx bm amy amx am   Ukn Ukn URn k k R k k R resykyi resxkxi resRi bdp,y bdp,x bdp adp,y adp,x adp 25   2  2  2  2  22  2 2 2 2 2 2     t t t t t t t t t 28   2  2  2  2  22  2 2 2 2 2 2       t t t t t t 29 29\ield values for apparent truth and apparent clustered and centroided measurements relative to the antenna and supports the calculation of 2 3 k D

Some of these investigations were inspired by algorithm errors detected a nd correct with this technique Other investigations are open ended in that they point out places where further algorithm improvements are needed The results presented in the examples only consider random effects that vary from pulse to pulse or dwell to dwell.  If covariance consistency cannot be obtained at this scale, then there is little hope of getting it right over an ensemble of Monte Carlo trials The scenario used in the examples consists of an ESR Xband radar tracking an incoming ballistic target.  The target range relative to the radar varies from ~380 km to ~25 km The target\222s RCS is large enough so that waveform control maintains an SNR close to the goal SNR of 25 dB.  The target\222s mean RCS and percent scintillation changes as the aspect angle varies from ~50\260 to ~0.6\260 over its trajectory The sine-space azimuth is n early constant varying from 0.70 to ~0.56 at apogee to ~0 66.  The sine-space elevation varies over a wider range from ~-0.40 to ~0.11 at apogee to 0.07.  Under these conditions tracking error is fairly small so that the target is track ed near beam center.  One exception to beam-center track ing occurs in the first example where different values for beam-steering offsets are added on purpose Targets Away from Beam Center Consider the difference in Fi gure 7 between measurements that occur on or near beam center where the monopulse response is approximately linear versus measurements that occur closer to the edge where the monopulse response is curved.  The monopulse response transforms uncertainty in y I into uncertainty in DOA Near beam center a Gaussian uncertainty in y I results in a Gaussian uncertainty in DOA Closer to the edge, the monopulse response distorts y I 222s uncertainty so that the DOA\222s un certainty is both biased and no longer Gaussi  Unless some compensation is applied, it is expected that the covariance consistency will be better near the beam\222s center compared to the edge.  Indeed, plots of consistency versus distance from beam center in Fi gure 8 match expectations The order of plots from top to bottom and the legend order are the same.  A value equal to 1 is consistent while a value greater than 1 implies that th e reported covariance is smaller than the uncertainty in the data.  To generate these curves constant beam-point offsets of 0, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 12.5 of the 3dB beamwidth were added to the elevation direction of the nominal beam point.  A sliding window of 50 points was used to calculate the average 2 1 k D values plotted in the curves     On Beam Center Gaussian Gaussian Gaussian Non-Gaussian and Biased Off Beam Center y I DOA     On Beam Center Gaussian Gaussian Gaussian Non-Gaussian and Biased Off Beam Center y I DOA  Figure 7 - Measurements on the monopulse curve One notable feature of Figure 8 is the sensitivity.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
