Cloud and land Elevation Satellite ICESat 2 suffered an anomalous occurrence that resulted in the suspension of mission operations The U.S National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA rapidly convened an Independent GLAS Anomaly Review Board IGARB to examine this event in detail prior to activation of backup systems on ICESat The IGARB findings identified the pump laser diode arrays LDAs within the laser transmitter subsystem as the source of the anomaly 
and proceeded to recommend a recovery plan for the ICESat mission 3 The IGARB findings were deemed a sufficiently important lessons learned resource that NASA undertook to make the information available to designers of technologically similar missions both within NASA and in the broader community of U.S Government USG organizations with a stake in space-based laser instrumentation In fulfillment of this commitment the NASA Earth Science Technology Office sponsored a joint industry/USG 
Community Forum on Laser Diode Arrays in Space-Based Applications that was held March 2-3 2004 in Arlington Virginia 4 The purpose of the Community Forum was twofold Firstly to brief the ICESat/GLAS failure to the community at large and secondly to strengthen dialog between the LDA vendor and user communities concerning technology development requirements for robust long-life diode arrays intended for operation in space The Forum included both formal 1 


presentations and an open discussion during which there was forthright debate between USG and industry delegates concerning the competing needs and approaches of each sector This process culminated in the suggestion that NASA establish a working group composed of government industrial and academic representatives to continue the dialog This group the Diode-laser Array Working Group DAWG was formed in July of 2004 and serves to provide a national-level consumer/provider forum for discussion of engineering and manufacturing issues that impact the reliability and survivability of high-power broad-area laser diodes and laser diode arrays in space 2 WORKING GROUP GOALS Demonstrations within the last two decades have shown the utility of laser-based instrumentation in a variety of spacebased applications such as remote sensing 5 highbandwidth communications 6 spacecraft-to-spacecraft metrology 7 descent/landing guidance/hazard avoidance 8 and rendezvous/proximity operations 9 The solidstate laser devices used in these applications are optically pumped by LDAs and unanticipated reliability issues with this component class in particular can severely impact onorbit mission life and mission success In order to mitigate these impacts the DAWG reviews lessons learned from past current and planned activities among the Group members and evaluates current and proposed design and engineering practices as they relate to component reliability The ultimate goal of the group is to synthesize and specify baseline environmental requirements that reflect the minimum qualification standards for laser diodes to be used in space flight applications and also to formulate technology roadmaps to support USG investment and procurement strategies for assuring the quality and enduring availability of space-qualified LDAs Recognizing the inherent practical limitations it is nevertheless the group's desire to also recommend standardized testing protocols for the qualification of laser diodes for space flight and to develop consensus manufacturing operational environment control and certification standards for incorporation into contractual vehicles between vendors and the USG The formulation and validation of standardized test protocols and derating recommendations can only be accomplished by reference to a substantial body of test data At the time that the DAWG was established NASA already had in place a significant LDA test program as a component of its Laser Risk Reduction Program LRRP 10,11 The LRRP has since become the umbrella program for NASA activities related to DAWG Although only NASA facilities and test data deriving from them are considered here it is planned to incorporate test data originated by manufacturers and other USG programs into the DAWG activity as and when these sources are made available 3 NASA TEST PROGRAM A strategy of testing redundancy and derating is employed to mitigate the risk of a single point failure in LDA-pumped spaced-based laser systems Although cost and schedule considerations ultimately dictate the amount of risk reduction that is sustainable testing even a small number of devices produces statistically significant data that can help predict the performance of the laser Within NASA laser diode test and evaluation programs are currently underway at the Goddard Space Flight Center GSFC the Langley Research Center LaRC and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL Because collaboration with LDA vendors is a key factor in the success of these programs performance data are shared with the suppliers both directly and through the DAWG consortium to facilitate and campaign for quality product development for application in space systems The emphasis of the GSFC program is on 808-nm LDAs for pumping the Nd family of laser hosts 12 while the LaRC program focuses on 792-nm LDAs operating in the longpulse duration mode required for pumping 2-gm Tmand/or Ho-based laser materials 13 The test facility at JPL extends evaluation to single diode formats that address a wide range of wavelengths corresponding to the diverse nature of laser applications at NASA 14,15 NASA GSFC Test Program The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has been active in the area of space-based lidar instruments for many years Recent GSFC satellite missions have used low repetition rate 100 Hz Q-switched diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers Understanding the operational characteristics of the pump LDAs is critical to assessing the readiness and capability of a laser system for space based missions GSFC has developed state-of-the-art facilities for the test and characterization of diode lasers to quantify reliability of available commercial off-the-shelf COTS parts and address issues with their use in space focusing on quasiCW 808-nm LDAs 2 


Raman luminescence emission wavelength and Spectrometer coupled Spectroscopy peak PL to stress strain with an Olympus BX61 level microscope LDAs are complex devices with multiple failure mechanisms that are not only dependent on operational conditions but on the design manufacture and operational history of the device so that modeling their reliability is non-trivial In addition different failure mechanisms will have different activation conditions and finding accurate acceleration parameters for testing is not straightforward Furthermore performance statistics are expensive to acquire due to the cost of the arrays The strategy for dealing with these complexities is to compile comprehensive data sets throughout the device life cycle with emphasis on the engineering and physics of failure mechanisms The LDAs are first fully characterized to establish a baseline for individual array performance and status Then the diodes are subjected to a form of stress such as operating them in a defined test e.g subjecting them to radiation or long-term testing The LDAs are then characterized again to observe the effect of the stressor This procedure is repeated for different stressors on many devices In this way we intend to observe the effects that different operational and environmental conditions have on the LDAs This will enable a set of recommended practices for operation and handling of the diodes to maximize performance and mitigate risk The observed performance over time is correlated against the initial observed parameters to formulate a screening criterion which can then be used to predict device performance This would then be used to judge the flight readiness of particular devices Substantial attention has been given to creating repeatable characterization procedures and instrumentation so that observed changes are accurately attributed to a stress parameter or device performance rather than measurement variability A comprehensive set of characterization measurements to evaluate the optical performance electrical characteristics and workmanship of the LDAs has been developed This includes inspecting the package for areas of increased mechanical stress and the monitoring of thermal gradients The characterization methods are listed in Table 1 Details of these measurement techniques and results can be found in reference 12 These measurements establish a baseline for each device and are then used both for comparison to the same device at a later time and also against different devices Using these measurements failure modes are evaluated and correlated to identify precursors to failure To date over 230 arrays 1100 laser bars from five vendors have been characterized and over 450 device characterizations including multiple characterizations of a single device have been completed Because of the unique environment of space GSFC has also developed test facilities protocols and equipment to quantify the effects of radiation vibration vacuum thermal 3 cycling power cycling and long-term operation Details of measurements and instrumentation can be found in reference 16 Table 1 Suite of characterization capabilities

designed experiment is therefore information oriented rather than success oriented as a normal test operation under controlled conditions might be construed and comprises a set of structured coherent tests that are analyzed holistically Designed experiments provide an efficient means for understanding diode performance and lifetime characteristics When applied in manufacturing settings this ultimately promotes reduced device-to-device variability shortened product development cycles minimized expenditure and improved asset usage Effective operational lifetimes in billions of cycles or in hours can be determined as a function of input variable settings carrying simultaneously many covariates such as radiation exposure vibration and thermal cycling manufacturer packaging etc These characteristics are too important to be relegated to the standard somewhat arbitrary testing techniques that are conventionally employed The experimental testing plan of necessity must by its nature be statistically designed 20 In addition designed experiments are run to establish predictable performance characteristics with the fewest number of experiments A simple notional example using two independent variables XI and X2 and a response Y is shown in Table 2 in which a so-called One Factor at A Time OFAT approach is compared to a Central Composite Design CCD Table 2 Sample designed experiment data set comparing the OFAT and CCD a proaches 20 OFAT CCD XI X2 Y Xla X2a Ya 78 230 64 90 220 77 90 230 75 150 220 93 120 230 93 90 240 72 150 230 96 150 240 99 162 230 94 120 230 93 120 216 92 120 230 93 120 220 92 78 230 64 120 230 93 162 230 94 120 240 93 120 216 92 120 244 93 120 244 93 The OFAT techniques only search the design space along the two axes whereas the CCD samples much more of the parameter space allowing the developer to construct a regression equation that better characterizes the response This is shown pictorially in Figure 4 in which it is clear that the CCD methodology is less restrictive of the design space and therefore superior to the OFAT option CIA xi 0 OO 100i 1D0 0CO xi Figure 4 Graphical representation of the two data sets OFAT and CCD given in Table 2 20 Designed experiments can separate such factors by accounting for continuous discrete and categorical variables in a single planned set of experiments They are particularly appropriate for new diode designs and/or manufacturing techniques because many problems of performance and reliability are affected by manufacturing factors as opposed to intrinsic diode failure mechanisms Usually at least one replicate of each experimental point would be run to better understand the variance of the response as well as the response itself 5 WORKING GROUP PRODUCTS The primary near-term DAWG objective is the generation of a draft requirements document that sets out a group of core test parameters applicable across the widest range of device types The intent of this document is to provide guidance to laser diode manufacturers concerning the reliability and durability standards that will be expected by USG space programs proposing to use this product class The longer range goal of the working group is the consensus formulation of definitive manufacturing environmental control requirements and standardized test protocols that codify minimum qualification standards for diode laser devices intended for spaceflight applications 6 


6 CONCLUSION We have described the genesis of a cross-sector Diode-laser Array Working Group the conditions that brought it about and the activities currently being pursued The Group's purpose is to assert a more systematic and rationalized approach to the engineering and space qualification of this class of components in order to promote the long-term availability of high-reliability products for insertion into future space missions that are reliant for their operations on solid-state laser technology The Group's goal is to generate a comprehensive and authoritative set of test and space qualification guidelines that could be used as recommendations for insertion into contractual vehicles with component vendors As such these guidelines will be promulgated as advisory with discretion for requirements on full compliance residing with the issuing sponsor ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Working group activities at the NASA Langley Research Center and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center are supported under the Laser Risk Reduction Program sponsored by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office Research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology is performed under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA Mention of specific company names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement by the authors their affiliated organizations or the U.S Government REFERENCES 1 J.B Abshire X Sun H Riris J.M Sirota J.F McGarry S Palm D Yi and P Liiva Geoscience Laser Altimeter System GLAS on the ICESat mission On-orbit measurement performance Geophys Res Lett 32 L21S02 doi:10.1029/2005GL024028 2005 2 B.E Schutz H.J Zwally C.A Shuman D Hancock and J.P DiMarzio Overview of the ICESat mission Geophysical Research Letters 32 L21 SO1 doi 10.1029/2005GL024009 2005 3 Independent GLAS Anomaly Review Board Executive Summary http://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/IGARB.pdf 4 Community Forum on Laser Diode Arrays in SpaceBased Applications CD-ROM proceedings NASA Earth Science Technology Office 2004 5 D.M Tratt Laser remote sensing Addressing key measurement challenges in the Earth sciences Proc SPIE 5575 1-7 doi:10.1117/12.568748 2004 6 D.L Begley Free-space laser communications A historical perspective Proc 15th Annual Meeting of the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society Vol 2 391-392 doi 10.1109/LEOS.2002.1159343 2002 7 O.S Brozek M Peterseim K Danzmann I Freitag C Fallnich and H Welling The laser system for the LISA technology demonstrator in Gravitational Waves Third Edoardo Amaldi Conference American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings Volume 523,393-394 doi:10.1063/1.1291886 2000 8 C.C Liebe A Abramovici R.K Bartman R.L Bunker J Chapsky C.-C Chu D Clouse J.W Dillon B Hausmann H Hemmati R.P Komfeld C Kwa S Mobasser M Newell C Padgett W.T Roberts G Spiers Z Warfield and M Wright Laser radar for spacecraft guidance applications Proc 2003 IEEE Aerospace Conference Volume 6 2647-2662 doi 10.1109/AERO.2003.1235190 2003 9 M Nimelman J Tripp G Bailak and J Bolger Spaceborne Scanning Lidar System SSLS Proc SPIE 5798 73-82 doi:10.1 117/12.604203 2005 10 F Peri Jr and G.J Komar Active remote sensing technology development plans for NASA's Earth Science Enterprise Proc SPIE 4484 1-7 doi 10.1117/12.452767 2002 11 F Peri Jr W.S Heaps and U.N Singh Laser risk reduction technology program for NASA's Earth Science Enterprise Proc SPIE 4893 166-175 doi:10.1117/12.466071 2003 12 M.A Stephen A Vasilyev E Troupaki G.R Allan and N.B Kashem Characterization of high-power quasi-cw laser diode arrays Proc SPIE 5887 58870A doi 10.1117/12.620373 2005 13 F Amzajerdian B.L Meadows N.R Baker B.W Barnes U.N Singh and M.J Kavaya Improving lifetime of quasi-CW laser diode arrays for pumping 2-micron solid state lasers Proc SPIE 6550 655010 doi:10.1117/12.724777 2007 7

of other processes, standardizing them and linking with technology in an ES-enabled environment made those processes very rigid and inflexible. The best practice processes embedded in the software are considered truly best practices in this organization With regular updates ensuring the incorporation of latest developments in practices and technologies, it is generally believed that the requisite agility is also part of the best practices. This study results suggest the influence of integration and standardization characteristics on the firm s ability to build agility in their processes. The effects, however, vary depending upon the type of integration and the extent of that integration achieved by the organization after the implementation of enterprise system. While the technical tight-coupling of the enterprise system infrastructure may limit the firm s ability to build agile processes, both vertical and horizontal integration, and standardization of the processes and information appears to be contributing positively While demanding their IT infrastructures to be tightly integrated for control and visibility purposes with the help of enterprise systems, firms are seeking to deliver agility with loosely coupled systems and technologies simultaneously. Though it is considered difficult to achieve both agility and control simultaneously in the past, today introduction of web services and service oriented architecture are expected to deliver both. Recognizing the weaknesses of enterprise systems, ES software vendors and business organizations are expending a significant proportion of their IT investment in Web services and business process management technologies The leading enterprise systems software vendors such as SAP and Oracle are now incorporating Web services standards into their next generation software solutions. For example, SAP has so far delivered 1000 Web service components and recently released the first Web services enabled ES suite. These emergent technologies are centered on the goal of providing the requisite process agility to enterprises by offering a competent business process platform from which to dynamically compose processes [70 37  B u ild in g ag i lit y  in to b u si n e s s p r o cesses a n d  implementing them is not easy and is dependent not just on the IT infrastructure including enterprise systems, but also on other factors such as business process management maturity levels and process characteristics specific to a particular organization Further research on building and implementing agile processes in dynamic business environments is necessary   7.

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
