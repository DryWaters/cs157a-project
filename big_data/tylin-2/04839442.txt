The sea surface emissivity \(SSE\ormally considered as unity or 
constant. However, in a real case, the sea surface emissivity changes with the wind speed. In this study 1 2 we would like to check whether the wind speed had only minimal effect on the sea surface temperature, as was assumed in the prior literature. A new algorithm which included the term of SSE in the function of wind speed was established. The new algorithm was compared with the day split multichannel MCSST\algorithm. The coeffi cients of the new algorithm were retrieved by the new de rived equation with includes the term of emissivity. Th e algorithm coefficients of 
MCSST were retrieved by regression analysis with large amount of SST in-situ data. The SST data simulated by the new algorithm were compared with the SST data simulated with MCSST algorithm. The scatter plot of new derived SST algorithm coefficients was generated. The regression analysis was performed to st udy the effect of wind speed The result showed that only the high wind speed had significant effect on SST retrieval  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1

Radiometer \(AVHRR rument with three infrared IR\channels suitable for estimating sea surface temperature \(SST Many algorithms have been developed for estimating SST The most common algorithms are supplied by NOAA called CPSST the nonlinear \(NLSST\alton et.al  However these algorithm coefficients we re derived by using a large amount of in-situ SST data. The algorithm coefficients were zonal and time dependent. Besides that, the algorithms are only accurate for low wind speed In this study, we analyzed how the wind speed affects the sea surface temperature. First we derived the equation of SST as a function of sea surface emissivity \(SSE 
calculated how the SSE changes with wind speed and sensor zenith angle. Then we compared the new algorithm with the day multichannel sea surface temperature MCSST\lit algorithm The result showed that the MCSST algorithm and new algorithm are highly correlated. Overall, the SST simulated by new algorithms and MCSST is good except for the wind speed of 15 m/s 2  M ATERIAL A ND D ATA S OURCES  We require brightness temperature at 11\265m and 12\265m sensor zenith angle and wind sp eed to retrieve the surface emissivity. The data of brightness temperature and sensor 
zenith angle were from an Advanced Very High Resolution AVHRR\image captured at 05:19 UTC, 20 August, 2006 These data were obtained from website of the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System CLASS\The AVHRR radiometer includes five channels channel 1 in the visible spectral range, channel 2 in the near infrared reflective region, and three channels in the thermal infrared emission region.

The algorithm coefficients did not consider the effect of transmittance or SSE. However the new algorithm coefficients are SSE and transmittance dependent From equation \(7\we know that SSE affects the SST retrieval. Consequently, if the SSE was affected by the wind speed, then wind speed will also have effect on SST retrieval. Therefore it was important for us to study how the wind speed affects the SSE First of all, we simulated the SSE data by using the method of Kazuhi wi t h wi nd speed, from 0\260 t o 15 m  s  sensor zenith angle from 0\260 to 60\260; wavelength of 3.7\265m 11\265m and 12\265m. The simulation was made with the assumption that atmospheric transmission of wavelength 11\265m was 0.96 and transmission of wavelength 12\265m was 0.94.  Then we generate graphs and observed the interrelationship between each parameter. The data was shown in Table 2 Then, we masked the cloud and land pixels with the improved masking technique [Ng et.al The val u es of brightness temperature in unmasked pixels were used only for calculation. After that, we performed the modeling of the new SST algorithm coefficients, a ij and \(a ij b ij  image processing software, PCI 10.1 with the input file of band 4 and band 5 of AVHRR image. The graphs were then generated by statistical software, Minitab R14. By using these algorithm coefficients, we retrieved the SST data from equation \(9\mulated with new algorithm was then compared with the multichannel algorithm 4  D ATA AND R ESULT  We used the method of Kazuhi t o si m u l a t e t h e sea surface emissivity and the data was shown in table 2 Table 2 Response of SSE with wind speed, sensor zenith angle and wavelength Sea surface emissivity Wind speed Zenith angle 3.7 \265m 11 \265m 12 \265m 0 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 10 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 20 0.9743 0.9924 0.9888 30 0.9732 0.9919 0.9880 40 0.9697 0.9902 0.9853 50 0.9594 0.9846 0.9766 0 60 0.9311 0.9968 0.9506 0 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 10 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 20 0.9740 0.9924 0.9887 30 0.9730 0.9919 0.9879 40 0.9690 0.9901 0.9851 50 0.9580 0.9842 0.9761 1 60 0.9300 0.9659 0.9496 0 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 10 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 20 0.9740 0.9924 0.9887 30 0.9720 0.9918 0.9878 40 0.9690 0.9898 0.9846 50 0.9570 0.9835 0.9751 3  60 0.9280 0.9643 0.9476 0 0.9745 0.9925 0.9889 10 0.9744 0.9925 0.9889 20 0.9740 0.9923 0.9886 30 0.9720 0.9917 0.9876 40 0.9680 0.9895 0.9842 50 0.9560 0.9828 0.9741 5  60 0.9260 0.9627 0.9459 0 0.9744 0.9925 0.9889 10 0.9743 0.9924 0.9888 20 0.9730 0.9922 0.9884 30 0.9720 0.9913 0.9871 40 0.9670 0.9877 0.9830 10  50 0.9540 0.9799 0.9716  212 212  212 212 003 212 212   iijjijs T b T a T 212 212  212   1   8  The equation \(7\ also be written in the form iijijijijs T ba T T a T

Therefore the sea surface emissivity can be assumed to be constant for the nadir observation and the sea is calm. When the wi nd speed increased, the SSE decreased gradually. The d ecrease of SSE became more obvious when the zenith angle is increased. The SSE decrease abruptly at wind speed=15m/s for the zenith angle=60\272. Besides, the changing of SSE with wind speed is most obvious at the wavelength of 11\265m. However over all the SSE is in the range below 0.92 Then, we computed the values of a ij and b ij by equation \(8 and studied how the SST coeffici ents were affected by the wind speed, v and sensor zenith angle 260.

The slope and intercept of the fit linear equation was also quite consistent except the algorithm with wind speed of 15 m/s. This implied that the low wind speed had no significant effect on SST retrieval The wind speed should only be considered in retrieving the SST data when the wind speed is greater than 15 m/s 5  C ONCLUSION  The SSE is quite consistent and near to unity for low wind speed and low sensor zenith angle. However, the SSE decreases more obviously when the sensor zenith angle increases. The SST data simulated by new SST algorithm also has a similar trend. The new SST algorithms were highly correlated with the MCSST algorithm. The wind speed affected the sea surface te mperature, but the effect is not significant for the low sensor zenith angle and low wind speed. However the study was only done with the simulation without the validation of field measurement of wind speed and water vapor data. The validation will be done in a future study

With the results gathered from the operations cen ter software, an analysis was performed on the experime nt outcome characterizing the overall performance of DTN From a broad perspective, the experiment was a success in that it proved the ION software capable of space mission operation and raised the technology readiness level to that of a tested and flown software package.  The DTN concept proved capable of automatically re-transmitting missing or corrupt data without flight team intervention, specifically demonstrated during several small unplanned communications outages at DSN stations.  DTN management actions were requi red to update the ION clock aboard EPOXI on a semiweekly basis to compensate for a drifting spacecraft clock, as well as insert new routes after an unplanned power outage across the EOC network Experiment analysis yielded DTN performance benchmarks in link utilization, prioritizati on, node storage and routing For all passes with sufficient data in the transmission queue DINET maintained a link utilization rate over 90%, even when introducing artificial link errors by dropping approximately every 32 nd LTP segment.  Received data analysis confirmed that higher priority information maintained an advantage over lower priority information and also that this advantag e increased as link capacity diminished \(due to the artificial data loss on the link\.  The node storage utilization benc hmark provided proof that node storage usage stabilized over the course of the experiment, approaching steadystate.  An analysis of network traversal showed that data was efficiently moved through different paths as dictated by the ION routing algorithm when the network topology changed. This demonstrated the advantages of the routing automation afforded by the ION routing protocol 5  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper has briefly described the JPL Deep Impact Network \(DINET\ay/Disruption Networking \(DTN technology experiment, intended to increase the technical readiness DTN for space missions and supporting ground and space-based relay infrastruct ure.  This represents the first deep space implementation of DTN in flight and ground software, and paves the way for future space networks.  DINET demonstrated the Interplanetary Overlay Network \(ION\mplementation of DTN, which incorporates the Bundle Protocol and LTP retransmission protocol.  We have described the DINET Experiment Operations Center \(EOC its functions in accomplishing this experiment.  The DINET EOC starts all ION processes experiment data sources, stat us message receiver processes and display processes.  The ION-based Monitor and Control System is an innovative, intranet-based software application which receives status messages and displays live results from the DINET network.  With this Monitor and Control application, the ION software and protocol diagnostic messages issued by network nodes are collected, analyzed stored into a database in real-time.  This application also provides a web interface for viewing the data in real-time and for interactive database queries 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and the Nationa l Aeronautics and Space Administration

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
