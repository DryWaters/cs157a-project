I NTRODUCTION  The MESSENGER spacecraft is on an interplanetary cruise that will end on March 18, 2011, when MESSENGER will be the first spacecraft to or bit Mercury. MESSENGER will carry out a broad range of observations of Mercury for one Earth year including a radio science investigation to determine whether the planet has a liquid core MESSENGER’s instruments will collect data to be stored on the spacecraft’s solid-state recorder \(SSR forwarded to NASA’s Deep Space Network \(DSN received on Earth, the DSN will then forward scientific and spacecraft housekeeping data to the MESSENGER Mission   1  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00©2008 IEEE  2  IEEEAC paper 1630, Version 
5, Updated January 17, 2008  Operations Center \(MMOC\urel Maryland. The robustness of MESSENGER’s onboard data file system will help to enhance the quantity of scientific data beyond  While in Mercury orbit, MESSENGER will contact the DSN 12 times per week to downlink data to Earth, with each contact lasting approximately eight hours. The quantity and quality of scientific data that can be expected to be returned from Mercury is determined by several factors: \(1 the DSN contact schedule, which is established by agreement prior to launch, \(2\he spacecraft’s radio frequency \(RF\ telecommunication subsystem design and effective isotropic radiated power \(EIRP\, \(3\he DSN’s nominal performance including antenna and receiver 
performance, and \(4\ink margin requirements imposed by the mission team. For MESSENGER, the minimum required science data return objectives are met. The techniques outlined below show how optimization and link margin reductions allow enhanced science return without sacrifice of data quality by means of a hybrid approach to the physical and protocol layers to ensure data integrity  Link margin is required to assure that the scientific data will not be lost by deviations from the expected performance Deviations can include weather, solar noise, wind, and random antenna pointing errors \(both spacecraft and DSN In the case of MESSENGER the baseline link margin is 1.5 dB  The DSN’s nominal performance is not fixed but is often treated as such for simplicity 
Such a first-order approach with a static model of DSN performance, however, will not yield an optimum link design. Optimizing a deep space telecommunications link almost always translates into maximizing the ground-received signal-to-noise ratio. Prelaunch estimates of data return for MESSENGER were nonoptimized  The DSN’s performance is ante nna specific and varies with antenna elevation angle Recent 34m beam wideguide BWG\ntenna performance upgrades have been  completed by the DSN to DSS-26 Goldstone, California, DSS-34 Canberra, Australia and DSS-55 Madrid, Spain, which have significantly improved their overall performance. The resulting performance improvement better allows for 


2 optimization techniques to be pursued because the atmospheric noise as a function of elevation angle is a larger portion of the total noise. Atmospheric noise can be a significant challenge at low an tenna elevation angles.  The signal from the MESSENGER spacecraft passes through multiple effective layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, due to the slant angle effect, thus attenuating the signal more than if the signal passed through a single layer of the atmosphere at zenith. As an example, at a 10 degree elevation angle a 34m antenna, DSS-24 in Goldstone, California, has an atmospheric noise temperature, T atm of 15.38 K or 5.63 air masses   The receiver electronics are cr yogenically cooled to reduce the additive noise of the active device so that it can receive extremely small signals from throughout the solar system Waveguide loss, spillover, scatter and other losses are combined with th e noise temperature of the receiver electronics to form the noise temperature, T vac which is the effective noise temperature of the ground antenna in the absence of atmosphere. The gain G, of an antenna reflector changes with elevation angle due to the deformation of the main antenna reflector from the rigging point, typically a 45 degree elev erefore, the gain-to-noise temperature of a DSN antenna at a given elevation angle is     K dB T G sys 1  vac sys T T T   atm K  2  The changing gain-to-system noise temperature of an antenna, a key metric of DSN performance, makes optimization possible by changing the science return data rate to match the changing G/T sys thus maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio at the antenna  Science data return can be managed in several ways depending on the needs and risk tolerance of the individual mission.  Mission operation teams can use a “set and forget approach, meaning the science return data rate for an individual communication pass uses a single rate based on the worst G/T sys of all DSN antennas of the same size at a set elevation angle and worst case weather conditions. This approach allows mission planners to anticipate and easily accommodate last minute ante nna changes to the DSN schedule due to last minute maintenance, non-functioning antennas, mission emergencies or other local DSN issues This approach does not allow for any degree of optimization but makes data rate management simple from a planning and execution perspective. Th is paper will compare this approach to an ante nna specific optimized link design using CFDP 2.MESSENGER S L INK S TRATEGY  Optimization techniques have been previously explored to improve data return using the DSN at X-band and Ka-Band by taking advantage of changes in G/T sys over the course of a communications contact with a spacecraft a n  operational standpoint changing the data rate to match the changing G/T sys performance or lowering the link margin does impose challenges that could prove to outweigh the advantages of additional scientific data. As an example when files are transmitted fr om the spacecraft’s SSR to the MMOC, data will be missing because of changes in data rate or a negative link margin. In the absence of an automatic re-transmission protocol, the mission operations teams will have to identify th e missing pieces of the files and then, at a later track command the spacecraft to play back the missing file pieces. M eanwhile, the file on the SSR cannot be deleted until it and all other files have been examined for missing data, even though additional files are being added to the SSR. Depending on the speed and frequency of DSN contacts an SSR oversubscription can occur. Human error can also cau se files to be deleted from the SSR before the missing data can be reconciled 3.MESSENGER  F ILE BASED  SYSTEM MESSENGER’s scientific in strument and spacecraft housekeeping data are downlinked from the spacecraft’s onboard file system by a standard defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems \(CCSDS called the CCSDS File Deliver y Protocol \(CFDP\[6   CFDP is a protocol developed by CCSDS for the transmission of files from tw o entities in a space network Similar in concept to the File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\sed in terrestrial networks, it is designed to operate across space links that typically have intermittent connectivity, long delays, and high error rates. The entities in the MESSENGER architecture are: 1 the spacecraft’s on-board file system and the protocol layer; 2\ the MMOC ground software; and 3\ the MESSENGER X-band RF Telecommunications Subsystem acting as the physical layer between the two locations. JHU/APL engineers implemented the flight software and integrated a CFDP core, developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\nto the standard ground software [7 8 nfigu r ab le to  perform both reliable and unreliable transmissions MESSENGER uses reliable transmission  CFDP operates on a series of transactions, each of which constitutes the transmission of a file from one data store to another. For MESSENGER the operations team transfers files only from the spacecraft to the ground, as legacy software is used to send data in the opposite direction. A file transfer is initiated either by the on-board software or via an operations command as shown in Figure 1. To begin the transaction, a metadata protocol data unit \(PDU\s transferred to the ground. Th is PDU contains information such as the identifier for this transaction as well as the filename. Following this transmission, the CFDP software subdivides the file into multiple file data units or FDUs. The spacecraft radiates these FDUs until all data from a file have been sent. The software th en signals this event by transmitting an end of file \(EOF\is point, the 


3 CFDP software starts a timer to ensure that a reply to this EOF is received within a reasonable time    Fig. 1 CFDP transaction between the MMOC and the MESSENGER spacecrafts onboard file systems  While the flight software is sending the various PDUs, the MMOC software is collecting the pieces of the file for storage in the mirrored file system on the ground. The software is also verifying that all pieces of a file are received. Once an EOF PDU is collected on the ground and an acknowledgment \(ACK\smitted to the spacecraft to conf irm reception, the gro und software in the MMOC notifies the spacecraft what pieces of a file, if any are missing through a negative acknowledgement \(NAK PDU. When the flight softwa re receives this PDU, it retransmits the missing FDUs to the ground. Then, if the MOC CFDP determines that the file is complete, it radiates a finished indicator \(FIN to the spacecraft signifying the successful transmission of the file. The flight software completes the handshake by sending a FIN ACK to the ground, and the transaction is complete and the file is deleted from the SSR  The MESSENGER team operates CFDP in real time meaning that underlying software communicates during the pass to transport, handshake and delete files. CFDP requests only those pieces of the file that are missing sending the requests in real time or, if the pass is complete during the next available contact. Missing FDUs have priority for playback over all other files in the file systems 4.H YBRID BASED O PTIMIZATION  CFDP enables techniques for link optimization to be pursued without encumbering the mission operations team to identify and reschedule transmission of dropped or missing FDUs.  It also avoids the risk of losing highly valuable scientific data from the oversubscription of the recorder that may come if th e file deletions are delayed MESSENGER conducted several in-flight experiments incorporating the following strategies for link optimization and improved science return using CFDP  1  Reduce the science return downlink margin—from 1.5 dB to 0.5 dB 2  Implement a stepwise-variable downlink rate adjustment—change the downlink bit rate for every 0.5 dB change in G/T sys and maintain the minimum link margin of 0.5 dB over the course of the communications period 3  Select a downlink rate commensurate with the current elevation angle based on a model of individual antenna performance, with consideration of weather, solar and wind conditions instead of minimum elevation and weather worst case weather assumed in the planning phase  Both physical and protocol layers are used to ensure data integrity. If a downlink transfer frame is not correctable by the DSN using the physical layer the transfer frame is not sent to the MMOC and will be missing. The protocol layer CFDP, will recognize that downlink FDUs are missing and request a retransmission 5  S CIENCE D OWNLINK L INK M ARGIN  The variability of an X-band RF link due to weather conditions is not large as for Ka-band. Table 1 shows the weather variability of an X-band link at DSS-34 at 10 degrees and 80 degrees elevation. The column labeled Weather Conditions" refers to the percent of time that the G/T performance exceeds th  Table 1.

However, if the link was designed for 20 percent weather conditions then weather conditions could reduce the availability of the link until the antenna elevation angle increases sufficiently to overcome the margin deficit this is especially true at low elevation angles  Variability due to circumstances such as wind and antenna pointing accuracy were consider ed static conditions for the experiments outlined in this paper. The MESSENGER spacecraft was giving a 0.1 dB pointing accuracy loss and 


4 the DSN was 0.2 dB loss for wind conditions and deformation of the aperture. Any variability outside these static conditions was not considered  If the variability of the link caused by weather, wind or pointing error exceeded the 0.5dB link margin then CFDP would be required to retransmit the data that were missing  The net observed increase in da ta volume cause by lowering the link margin from 1.5dB to 0.5 dB is   log 10 1        dB  3   is the total frames minus the frame errors from all random sources divided by the total number of frames received  If the link frame error rates exceeded the net increase in data to be gained by lowering the link margin form 1.5 dB to 0.5dB, the added benefit would not be realized. Therefore careful modeling of the link is required 6  D OWNLINK R ATE A DJUSTMENTS  Table 1 demonstrates that as the antenna elevation angle rises or lowers so does the G/T sys performance of the antenna system.  To take advantage of the changing G/T sys  the downlink bit rate can be changed to mirror the changing G/T sys Due to the MESSENGER spacec raft architecture, the downlink rate cannot be changed continuously with G/T sys  therefore, can only be changed in a stepwise fashion.

In doing so, the total science volume for the mission can be increased as opposed to applying a worst case an tenna performance model to science volume calculations. Th e use of worst case antenna performance allows antennas of similar size to be swapped in the DSN schedule with little or no consequences to the expected science data return, but does not allow for optimization    Antenna  DSN  Case Worst Antenna  DSN  Targeted  90  10     012 sys sys T G T G dB   6

Also shown is the G/Tsys of DSS-26 on DOY 333 with 20% weather and 0.5 dB margin and 90% weather and 1.5 dB margin  A total science return improvement can be now calculated using a reduced link margin, stepwise downlink rate and a targeted antenna performa nce approach using   012       dB  7 8.I N F LIGHT P HYSICAL L AYER R ESULTS  Six in-flight experiments were conducted to measure the science improvement and re sulting overhead using the previously described link optimization strategy. The experiments were conducted in 2006 on DOY 324 with DSS-26, DOY 329 and 331 with DSS-14, DOY 333 with DSS-26 and DOY 334 and 345 with DSS-34 3 Figure 2 shows the data rates flown on DOY 333 and the corresponding G/T sys Also shown in Figure 2 for comparison is single rate approach if the 1.5 dB margin and 90% weather and its corresponding G/T sys   Table 2 shows the results of all experiments and the physical layer interaction with the in-flight experiment. It can be seen that a very small overhead is associated with an average overall gain of 3.357 dB over a conventional worst case fixed bit rate design with link margin 1.5 dB  To verify the techniques presented in this paper, the MESSENGER team developed a two phase approached to examine throughput.  The first phase, described below, was a proof of concept and developed to ensure minimal impact   3 Experiments conducted on DOY 333 th rough 345 were conducted using 20% planned weather conditions. A ll others were conducted at 90 planned weather conditions to current operations.  A second, longer campaign will be conducted later in 2008 Table 2.

If the overhead of the protocol layers is high, it could nullify the resulting throughput increase of the physical layer. To demonstrate that is not the 


6 case for CFDP, the results from DOY 333 will be analyzed The DOY 333 results represent measured protocol layer throughput during the test. Four transactions were active during this pass, as shown in Table 3. Playback began with the completion of a NAK for transaction 454 from a previous pass. This was followed by the playback of transactions 457, 458, and 456. Transaction 456 was also a file continuing from a previous track, but it was preempted by the higher priority 457 and 458 transactions. The computed bit rates shown in th e table are somewhat variable due to the granularity of the available telemetry and ground data  Table 3. Transactions on Day 333, 2006  ID Size bytes Playback Bit Rate \(bps Computed Bit Rate \(bps 454 142854 4167 4024 457 929291 4167 4022 458 510739 4167 4025 456 2137400 4167 4031 456 1052400 4695 4541  During this session, mission operations configured MESSENGER to use two bit rates during which playback was active: \(1\208.30 bps and \(3\ 5868.51 bps, and they also configured the spacecraft to transmit 4 file data frames to every one real-time frame. These settings provide effective science data rates of 4166.64 bps and 4694.81 bps respectively, given the ratio above. Using the observed flight data, CFDP adds approximately 1.2% to 1.4% of overhead which, together with framing overhead, gives the rates shown in Table 3. A transfer frame is 1115 bytes, of which 1095 are available for sc ience data transfer. A typical conservative setting for the downlink rate during this phase of the mission is 2422.48 bps using a 10 degree starting elevation angle on 90% weather with 1.5 dB margin Playback was active for 9319s. With the real-time/playback ratio of 4:1, the effective do wnlink rate for science data would be 1903 bps given no additional overhead burden from CFDP. With this rate and the amount of available downlink time, 2216757 bytes would have been downlinked versus the 4772684 bytes of science data downlinked during the actual playback period 10  CFDP  R ETRANSMISSION AND L ATENCY  Day 329 is an example of data retransmission by CFDP Table 4 shows the transactions active during this pass During this pass, several files required retransmission of data due to either drops in the link or switching between data rates  Figure 3 represents CFDP operations during this playback period. Transactions 35-49 are represented by bars in the figure when that particular transaction was active in the playback queue. Multiple transactions required retransmissions due to either the commanded downlink rate switches \(shown in yellow\or link dropouts \(shown in red A CFDP FDU is 1024 bytes which is slightly smaller than the available data size in a transfer frame. Hence, the majority of transfer frames contain the end of packet and the beginning of another. Therefore the loss of one downlink transfer frame results in the lo ss of two CFDP packets. This loss is recognized by the gr ound CFDP software which sends NAKs to the spacecraft listing the pieces of the file that are missing. This is represented by the NAKs shown on the right side of the graphic. Additionally, a portion of the pass was devoted to retransmission of data from a previous pass  For missions that have large round trip light times or large file sizes or both, file latency caused by CFDP retransmission could impose challenges to SSR management and SSR size requirements.  In addition missions that have time critical data such as navigation images may want to avoid the uncertainty of variable file arrival times due to retransmissions and added round trip light times  The results in Table 4 show that the 46.6 % of the files required an additional retransmission or one or two FDUs As the files are sliced into multiple FDUs, only the individual missing FDUs require retransmission as opposed to the entire file.  That equates to 2 additional round trip lights time or the next available contact for the file to be complete. 53.3% of the files were able to be complete on the first transmission from th e spacecraft to the MMOC      Table 4.

Playback Results on Day 33, 2006  11  S UMMARY  In-flight testing of the MESSENGER spacecraft demonstrated that a lowered link margin and stepwise changes in downlink data rate can significantly increase science volume without additional burden to the mission operations team using CFDP. CFDP added a small overhead to the downlink that was more than offset by the added volume obtained by the margin reduction and stepwise downlink rate changes. The above could be applied to Kaband operations where link variability is an even more substantial concern  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors thank Bob Nelson of the MESSENGER Mission Operations Team for his hard work and support to make the in-flight experiments possible, as well as Scott Burleigh of JPL for his comprehensive responses to questions on the intricacies of CFDP during software development.
