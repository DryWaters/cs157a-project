   IT Capacities Assessment Tool: A Survey of Hospitals in Canada  Mirou Jaana, Ph.D University of Ottawa jaana@telfer.uottawa.ca  Guy Paré, Ph.D HEC Montréal guy.pare@hec.ca  Claude Sicotte, Ph.D University of Montreal claude.sicotte@umontreal.ca  Abstract  This study presents an IT assessment tool that aims at capturing the level of IT sophistication in hospitals. In order to develop a measure that 
reflects IT capacities in hospitals, an IT scoring approach was proposed that incorporate eight IT dimensions related to the implementation of computerized processes and emerging technologies, and the level of internal and external systems integration. The instrument was validated through a survey of hospitals in two provinces in Canada \(Québec and Ontario\, and the psychometric properties revealed a good level of validity and reliability. Based on the results of the survey and the IT scores obtained, hospitals in 
both provinces seem to have a moderate to high level of implementation of various computerized processes; limited implementation of clinical systems was observed. Low IT scores were reported in relation to the implementation of emerging technologies. The level of systems integration was moderate with significantly higher level of integration among hospitals in Ontario limited clinical systems integration was observed   1. Introduction  
Since the release of the Institute of Medicine reports To Err is Human  d Crossing the Quality Chasm  ealt h inf o r m atio n  technologies \(IT\ have gained increasing attention and have been recognized as essential components for an improved health system. In a recent report presented by the national coordinator for health 
information technology in the ere w a s a  clear emphasis on the value of IT in achieving consumer-centered care. Similarly, efforts in Canada that encourage fast deployment of technologies are underway, as demonstrated by the national funding of projects in various IT-related areas across provinces \(e.g., electronic health records, telehealth, etc  Hospitals, which represent essential components of health care systems, are 
continuously exploring opportunities for investing in IT to improve efficiency, promote patient safety and better quality of care [5ccordin g to a recent survey by the American Hospital Association \(AHA\ hospital use of IT, around 46% of hospitals reported moderate to high use of clinical IT in 2006  w h ic h represen ts an increase compared to previous years. At present, IT priorities are mostly related to reducing medical errors, upgrading / replacing inpatient clinical 
systems, and implementing electronic medical records [9 recen t s u r v e y o f h o s p ital s in O n tario also showed that the implementation of technologies that reduce medical errors and promote patient safety was ranked as top e-health priority for hospitals [10    Despite recognizing the role of IT as a critical enabler for patient safety and quality of care and the increasing efforts invested by hospitals to 
benefit from these resources, little is known about the level of IT capacities in these settings Although scattered efforts have been made to develop measures that gauge IT in hospitals \(e.g 11 n o com p reh e ns i v e tool ex is ts th a t  captures the level of IT sophistication and allows Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


  the development of a valid IT score. Prior efforts in this area remain constrained by limitations associated with the measures and tools used. For instance, the crude nature of the indicators, the absence of a consistent scale that reflects the extent of implementation of various applications and technologies in hospitals and the lack of a welldeveloped scoring approach to gauge IT capacities in hospitals are examples  This research addresses these issues, proposes an instrument for assessing IT capacities in hospitals, and validates it through a survey of Canadian hospitals. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to build on existing evidence and  identify prior efforts to assess IT in hospitals. The results were mapped using the original conceptual framework developed by Paré and Si w h ic h defin e d IT sophistication along three dimensions \(functional technological, and integration\. The term IT sophistication is used to represent IT capacities in hospitals, including various applications and technologies as well as the integration among different systems. This paper focuses on the findings of the survey, and provides an overview of the IT scoring approach used to represent the level of IT sophistication in hospitals  2. Description of the instrument  A comprehensive literature review was conducted on Medline until September 2006 to build on the existing evidence and identify prior efforts that attempted to assess IT in hospitals. A total of 17 studies that provide indicators of clinical and administrative IT capacities were found. Six varied in their approaches to address this issue e.g., [16 h ile 11 s t u d i e s th at repres e n t t w o  more recent streams of research in this field relied on two IT measurement instruments in hospitals e.g., [12,13,19lthou gh th e rece n t l y  developed instruments presented important contributions in this area, limitations remained in relation to the absence of instrument validation, the crude nature of the measures, and the absence of a valid scoring approach \(e.g., [12  T h e len g t h  of the instrument and lack of a consistent scale to reflect the implementation of various applications and technologies represent additional issues that must be addressed \(e.g., [15,19   We mapped the results of these studies using the original conceptual framework proposed by Paré and Sicotte [15 bs equ e n t l y an IT assessment tool was developed that included 34 items exploring computerized processes in four areas \(administrative, clinical, patient management and clinical support activities\s assessing the implementation of contemporary technologies and 11 items investigating internal and external information sharing \(Appendix A\. We further incorporated a time frame in the tool to reflect current versus plans for implementation of IT; in the former, the extent of use of computerized processes and technologies was further assessed on a [1cale A g e n e ral i n f o r m ation s ect ion about the respondents and organizations was introduced at the end of the instrument  3. Methodology  3.1 Sample and data collection   In order to apply the IT assessment tool and evaluate its psychometric properties, we conducted a survey of health care organizations in two Canadian provinces \(Québec and Ontario\ween June and September 2007. All hospitals in these two provinces, which represent the largest health jurisdictions in Canada in terms of population served and health infrastructures, were invited to participate in this study. As part of the pretest, seven respondents \(three from Québec, two from Ontario and two from the United States\ompleted a first version of the questionnaire and provided feedback about the process \(e.g., administration time, clarity of directions\d the measures. Following the pretest, a number of minor changes were incorporated in order to improve the measures and the questionnaire s overall structure and clarity  The revised version of the questionnaire, with a cover letter indicating the purpose and the importance of the study, was sent to all hospitals in Québec and Ontario. As a first step, we contacted IT directors / administrators by phone, excluding those who had participated in the pretest, to present the study and solicit their participation \(Québec N=92; Ontario: N=129\ive IT directors in Québec and 12 in Ontario refused to participate due to reported time constraints; they were excluded from the survey. A hard copy of the questionnaire was then sent with a return envelope to all remaining organizations. Four weeks following the initial mailing, a reminder letter was mailed to the organizations that had not responded In total, 60 and 46 responses were received in Québec and Ontario, respectively, which represents an overall response rate of 52% \(106 hospitals  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


  3.2 Measurement issues  As indicated in Figure 1, following Paré and Sicotte s model for assessing IT sophistication 15   w h ic h  w a s v a lid ated a m o n g h o sp itals i n th e  U.S. and Canada [15,19 eig h t di m e n s io n s  provided the conceptual framework for the survey instrument used in this study. The first four dimensions refer to Functional IT sophistication  the fifth dimension relates to Technological IT sophistication and the last three dimensions refer to the Integration level   D1 = Administrative systems \(9 items D2 = Patient management systems \(8 items D3 = Clinical support systems \(4 items D4 = Clinical systems \(13 items D5 = Emerging technologies \(13 items D6 = Internal integration Administrative Enterprise Resource Planning system D7 = Internal integration Clinical \(Electronic Medical Record system D8 = External integration \(9 items  A total of 58 items were included in the questionnaire. For the first five dimensions, the respondents were asked to check the answers that best reflect the current status of various computerized processes and technologies in their organizations. They could choose between: 1 plan for implementation; 2\anning to implement; 3\ Began installation; and 4 Implemented. If they chose Implemented for questions under D1-D5, then they were also asked to identify on a [1-7 le the extent to which the systems or technologies are currently used \(1 Barely Used and 7 Extensively Used    For the internal integration dimensions \(D6 and D7\pondents were asked to check the answers that best reflect the current status of Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\d Electronic Medical Record systems \(EMR\hey could choose between: 1\plan for implementation; 2\ Planning to implement; 3 Began deployment; and 4\plementation completed. If they selected Began deployment  or Implementation completed they were also asked to choose the modules that are being deployed in the case of ERP, or the systems that are fully integrated with the EMR; a list of modules and systems was provided to them  Last, respondents were asked to identify the extent of information sharing with external entities dimension D8 L i k e rt s cale 1 Not at All and 7 Very Much The last section of the instrument included questions that provide an overview about the respondents and their respective hospitals  3.3 Scoring approach  We developed a scoring approach that assigns weights \(points\he questions in the survey and allows the calculation of an IT score for each dimension, as well as an overall IT score for hospitals  First, items measuring the status of computerized processes and technologies within hospitals \(dimensions D1 D5\ere assigned the following weights: 1\o plan for implementation 0 point; 2\anning to implement = 1 point; 3 Began installation = 3 points; 4\mplemented with weak utilization as indicated by answers within the [1terv al on t h e L i k e rt s cale = 4 points; and 5\plemented with strong utilization as indicated by answers within the [5al  on the Likert scale = 5 points. It is important the note however that four items assessing the implementation of advanced computerized processes \(clinical & support staff workload management; remote monitoring applications; online consumer health information; on-line patient appointment\were excluded from the calculation of scores due to the absence of variability in our sample and the consistently very low implementation levels  Figure 1: Conceptual model representing IT capacities in hospitals  HOSPITAL  External Entities Systems Integration with Other Entities     Technological IT Capacities  Emerging Technologies Internal Integration Clinical Administrative     Functional IT Capacities  Clinical Administrative Patient Management Clinical Su pp ort  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


  Second, the questions assessing internal integration \(dimensions D6 and D7\hich represent the extent of implementation of ERP and EMR systems, were assigned similar weights as above: 1\o plan for implementation = 0 point; 2 Planning to implement = 1 point; 3\ Began deployment = 3 points; 4\mplementation completed with \(1-3\P modules or 1-4 systems integrated with the EMR = 4 points; and 5 Implementation completed with more than 4 ERP modules or more than 5 systems integrated with the EMR = 5 points  The resulting score \(over 100\or the first seven dimensions \(D1 to D7\ equals the sum points for all items under a specific dimension divided by the total number of items in that dimension multiplied by 5 \(i.e. maximum number of points for an item\mes 100        Third, the questions measuring the external integration of systems \(Dimension D8\which was assessed on a [1cale  w e re as s i g n e d th e  following weights: 1\ternal integration \(i.e 1 on the Likert scale\t; 2\imal external integration \(i.e. 2 and 3 on the Likert scale\point; 3\derate level of integration i.e. 4 on the Likert scale\points; 4\gh level of external integration \(i.e. 5 and 6 on the Likert scale\ts; and 5\y high level of external integration \(i.e. 7 on the Likert scale points. Five items, which did not present variability and showed consistently very low information sharing levels \(with drug stores; with insurance companies; with external laboratories with governmental agencies; with patients\, were excluded. The score \(over 100\or the external integration dimension D8 equals the sum of points for the four items measuring external integration divided by the total number of items \(i.e. four multiplied by the maximum number of points for an item \(i.e. five\mes 100       Based on the answers to the questions falling under the eight IT dimensions in the survey, IT scores representing functional IT capacities technological IT capacities,  internal and external integration, and an overall IT score \(over 100 be computed for hospitals as follows             The overall IT scores can range from 0 to 100 A score of zero represents no current or plans for implementation of systems and technologies along the dimensions D1 to D7, and no external integration at all. A score of 100 is associated with strong utilization of technologies and systems, and very high systems integration. By using this formula, hospitals can assess their level of IT capacities in various areas, examine the evolution of their scores over time, and compare themselves to other hospitals. Scores falling in the following ranges are expected to represent different levels of IT capacities Scores between 0 and 25 Very low level of IT sophistication with minimal computerized processes and technologies, and limited levels of integration Scores between 26 and 50 Low to moderate level of IT sophistication; the level of IT capacities might vary according to the eight dimensions Scores between 51 and 75 Moderate to high level of IT sophistication; the level of IT capacities may vary according to the eight dimensions Scores between 76 and 100 High level of IT sophistication with implemented computerized processes and emergent technologies, and good levels of systems integration  3.4 Data analysis  First, descriptive analysis was conducted to provide an overview of the respondents and their respective organizations, and present the findings of the survey on IT capacities in hospitals along the eight IT dimensions. Specifically, the percent of hospitals in each of the categories of implementation was determined.

Results  This section presents the survey findings and is divided into three parts: 1\Sample overview; 2 Psychometric properties of the instrument; and 3 IT capacities and overall IT scores  4.1 Sample overview  As indicated in Table 1, most of the respondents in both provinces had either an undergraduate or master level education, and varied in backgrounds with the majority having an area of specialization in administration or information systems / technology. The managerial and IT tenure among the surveyed CIOs / IT directors was high; the average years of experience in IT was 17 years with more than 10 years experience in the current organization and 8 years in the current position The profile of the surveyed hospitals shows that more than half were not affiliated with a teaching university \(52%\d were characterized as rural hospitals \(62%\e average size of the hospitals was 354 beds, and the majority reported having emergency rooms \(92%\, operating rooms 85%\d intensive care units \(75 Hospitals in Québec were significantly larger and had more intensive care units and operating rooms than hospitals in Ontario    4.2 Psychometric properties of the instrument  In order to assess the reliability of the measures used to assess IT capacities in hospitals, Cronbach alpha coefficients were computed, which are good indicators of internal consistency. With the exception of the measures falling under the clinical support applications dimension, which were associated with a coefficient of 0.65, all coefficients for the other dimensions varied between 0.70 and 0.85, which indicates a good level of reliability of the measures developed  Construct validity, which refers to the ability of an instrument to measure specific constructs and traits [22 w a s al so d e ter m in ed to ex a m i n e whether the developed measures behave as expected. As Table 2 shows, the correlations on the leading diagonal \(correlations between similar measures\which represent the square root of the variance shared by the dimensions and their measures, are larger than off diagonal correlations among dimensions. This is reflective of convergent and discriminant validity Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Computerized processes  The extent of implementation of computerized processes varied according to the IT dimensions examined. The early administrative computerized systems \(e.g., material management systems accounting / financial information systems\ were implemented in the majority of hospitals, with comparable levels in the two provinces. The new generation of administrative systems however \(e.g business intelligence applications, disease costing systems\still not widely implemented, and hospitals in Québec seem to be ahead in introducing these systems as compared to hospitals in Ontario \(Table 3  As indicated in Table 4, the implementation of patient management systems varied between hospitals in Québec and Ontario. Hospitals in Québec have more advanced capacities with respect to operating room systems, emergency room systems, and ambulatory care scheduling systems. An opposite trend is observed however with respect to the implementation of the Master Patient Index \(MPI\ith the majority of hospitals in Ontario \(87%\aving these systems in place Interestingly, critical care systems were only implemented in a small number of hospitals in both provinces and only hospitals in Ontario reported considering future implementation of these systems  Computerized clinical support processes including laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology information systems were widely implemented with more than 80% of hospitals in both provinces reporting these systems in place.  The only difference between the two provinces was related to the implementation of Picture Archiving and 76% in Ontario vs. 55% in Québec\ough 31% of the hospitals in Québec had plans for implementing these systems   Last, the implementation of the majority of computerized clinical processes was limited, with the exception of electronic discharge summary, online access to knowledge database, and continuous quality improvement / risk management systems Table 5\ically, advanced systems \(e.g Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6

Hospitals in Québec are leading on some of technologies \(e.g., bar coding for material and medications management, robots for medication preparation and dispensing biometry, administrative data warehouse\. On the other hand, more hospitals in Ontario reported having technologies such as single sign-on, voice recognition, medical record scanning, bar coding for patient identification, and bedside terminals in place. Although most technologies were not widely used, a large number of hospitals reported plans for their implementation, with the exception of advanced technologies \(e.g., RFID, biometry, voice recognition and bedside terminals   4.3.3. Internal and external integration   The level of internal integration for administrative systems, as reflected by the implementation of ERP modules was high in both provinces. The majority of hospitals reported ERP in place \(85% in Québec and 78% in Ontario\he Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7

IT scores  We further computed IT scores for hospitals which revealed information about their IT capacities \(overall and along the eight dimensions As indicated in Table 8, hospitals in Québec and Ontario did not differ significantly on their overall IT sophistication; the overall IT sophistication score for the sample was moderate \(score = 56.3 A closer examination of the results shows that functional and technological IT sophistication were not significantly different between the two provinces. The overall functional IT score was moderate to high \(score = 66.3\hile the technological IT score that was low \(score = 30.1 The two provinces differed significantly on the scores for the integration level \(Ontario: 56.8 Québec: 46.3\hich was moderate in both cases  In general, the lowest IT scores were observed for clinical systems, emerging technologies, and external integration, which indicate limited capacities with respect to these dimensions; the scores for emerging technologies were particularly low in both provinces. The highest scores however were observed for clinical support systems and internal integration of administrative systems which were moderate to high  Significant differences were observed between the two provinces for administrative and patient management systems; hospitals in Québec had significantly higher scores on these two dimensions. On the other hand, significantly higher levels of internal integration of clinical systems were reported in Ontario \(Table 8   5. Discussion  Although progress has been made over the past years in relation to assessing IT capacities in hospitals \(e.g., [13-15, 24 prio r m e asu r es have been constrained by conceptual and methodological issues, which precluded the development of an IT scoring approach that reflects the level of IT capacities in hospitals.  This research addresses these issues and proposes an IT capacities assessment tool and a comprehensive IT scoring approach that captures various dimensions of IT sophistication in hospitals  The instrument was validated through a survey of hospitals in two provinces in Canada, and the psychometric properties demonstrated a good level of validity and reliability of the measures. The findings show a moderate level of IT sophistication among hospitals in Québec and Ontario  With respect to functional IT sophistication hospitals in Québec and Ontario reported moderate to high levels of implementation of computerized processes, with the exception of computerized clinical systems that were not widely available in these settings. Although these systems have the potential to reduce errors and support clinical decision making \(e.g., nursing and clinical documentation, CPOE, and clinical decision support systems\, they were still not widely used among the surveyed hospitals. Nevertheless, the high percent of hospitals reporting plans to implement these systems highlights current efforts undergone to address this issue  A closer examination of the other dimensions along functional IT sophistication reveals that hospitals in Québec have a higher level of implementation of administrative and patient management systems \(e.g., operating room and emergency room systems\, which might be explained by the differences in hospitals  characteristics; surveyed hospitals in Québec were larger and had more intensive care units and operating rooms than hospitals in Ontario.

  addition, the organization of the health care delivery system in Québec, which is based on the Health and Social Service Centers that provide a range of specialized and general services necessitates having certain administrative and patient management systems in place in order to function effectively. On the other hand, the province of Ontario is leading in terms of the implementation of MPI, PACS, and telemedicine This is not surprising in light of the recent efforts toward integrating services in various geographic areas in Ontario, and the increasing support of the government for telemedicine initiatives through the creation of the Ontario Telemedicine Network in 2006  Technological IT sophistication scores in both provinces revealed a significant gap in relation to the implementation of technologies that have the potential of reducing errors, improving efficiency and addressing security issues \(e.g., bar coding for patient identification and materials management bedside terminals, single sign-on, RFID, biometry And surprisingly, most of the surveyed hospitals did not report plans for implementing several of these technologies \(e.g., RFID, biometry, and bedside terminals\, which underscores the greater emphasis of hospitals on implementing computerized processes than technologies  The IT integration level was relatively low in our sample, with the exception of the internal integration of administrative systems \(ERP Hospitals in Ontario had significantly higher level of implementation of EMR, and more external systems integration with other organizations. This might be explained by the creation of Local Health Integration Networks by the Ontario government in 2006, which support the integration of services in the province  It is important to note that the exclusion of the 9 items, which showed no variability and had consistently low scores in our sample, does not undermine the importance and relevance of these computerized processes and external integration approaches. However, they seem too advanced at present and practically not available in hospitals Thus, incorporating them in the calculation of IT scores will not differentiate between hospitals on these items. Nevertheless, we expect that as these processes and approaches gain more attention in the future, they can further be incorporated in the IT sophistication scores  Although the response rate in this study appears to be highly satisfactory in comparison with most mail surveys w e ac k n o w l ed g e t h at th e  absence of data on non-responding hospitals precluded a comparison between responding and non-responding hospitals to confirm the representativeness of our sample. Finally, given the fact that the instrument was validated among hospitals in two specific provinces in Canada replicating the survey in other settings outside Canada and in other provinces can further support the instrument generalizability  Finally, the development of a valid and reliable tool for assessing the level of IT sophistication in hospitals, which can produce IT scores that reflect IT capacities in these settings, presents an important contribution to managers and researchers. This instrument can be a useful tool for hospitals to exercise benchmarking and assess their positions in the market in relation to IT capacities. In addition, it can also be used to further examine the relationship between IT and organizational / contextual variables, as well as the process and outcomes of care  6. Conclusion  The development of IT scores is a critical step forward towards addressing important research questions involving the determinants of IT sophistication in hospitals and the relationship between IT capacities and outcomes measures. By developing and validating an IT capacities assessment tool in hospitals, we unified prior literature in this area and proposed an IT scoring approach along eight dimensions representing computerized processes and technologies in administrative and clinical areas, as well as internal and external systems integration  The survey of hospitals in Québec and Ontario revealed a moderate level of IT sophistication Nevertheless, the IT capacities varied between the two provinces, although limited implementation of emerging technologies and clinical systems, and minimal internal integration of clinical systems was observed in both provinces.  This might raise concerns in light of the increasing focus on patient safety, especially that many of these systems and technologies have potential of reducing errors Future efforts are necessary to optimize on the available solutions on the market, and improve the level of systems integration, to ensure better continuity and integration of care Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9

  13  Use of Web Technologies The web development effort involved a long learning curve for some of the RDE Upgrade development team HTML We used HyperText Markup Language \(HTML\o layout the web framework and page structures AJAX/JSON  The AJAX \(asynchronous JavaScri pt and XML\tern was introduced to support a responsive web GUI.  An implementation of JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation provides the data service inte rface from the web client to a tomcat-maintained servlet. We have run into very few issues with this technology 10 11 12  CSS Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\provide a straightforward way to manage web page styles. The language is well supported through the open-source FireBug Edito 14  JavaScript We used JavaScript to provide a rich interactive web interface, however our experien ce with JavaScript was not entirely favorable.   The Java Script \(JS approach to APIs including widgets led to our implementing more JS code than we might otherwise have.  We found the 223typeless\224 language occasionally caused confusion.  We did find that it could be \223made to provide\224 a rich web interface though probably a heavier interface than it needs to be.  One real positive for JS is the huge volume of sample code available on the Internet, saving time when dealing with the many implementation problems that spring up JasperReport  We used a toolkit called JasperReport to build a database report we could execute from our web interface.  A JasperReport is edited using the iReport tool. When the report is opened, the JasperSoft library is executed which updates each field from the database and presents the updated report The next section describes some of the \223analysis views\224 that can be generated from data in the RDE store 5  R ELAY A CCOUNTABILITY A NALYSIS  From the start of the Phoenix mission through the current day the RDE tool has been us ed primarily to extract pass statistics for reporting.  The key primary tracked statistic is the total volume of data delivered by each relay spacecraft Typically the \223Export Volumes\224 web view is used for a 223quick\224 export of these data, though the \223General Query\224 view can also be used for this purpose.  Raw tabular data are exported in Comma Separated Value \(CSV\at and then normally imported into an Excel spreadsheet for charting Figure 6 shows the total volume over time from the start of Phoenix mission \(Sol 0\o Sol 120, about a month past the end of prime mission Cumulative Return Link Data Volume 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 0 30 60 90 120 Sol MRO Cumulative Ret Fill DV MRO Cumulative Ret PHX DV ODY Cumulative Ret Fill DV ODY Cumulative Ret PHX DV   Figure 6 \226 Cumulative Return Link Volume Figure 7 shows the same data values, but charted to show the total data volume transmitted per Sol  Return Link Data Volume by Sol PHX Lander Data + Fill Data 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 30 60 90 120 Sol ODY Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits MRO Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits  Figure 7 \226 Data Volume By Sol  On Figure 6 and Figure 7, the Phoenix Data Volume \(DV shown represents actual telemetry data and science product delivered.  The Fill DV on both figures represents \223fill\224 frames that are transmitted when a relay link is open but no actual lander data is available to transmit.  This chart shows that the Odyssey mission has carried the most part of 


  14 Phoenix relay data over MRO.  The low MRO volumes at the very early end of the chart are due to early MRO communications issues with Phoenix that were not resolved until later in the mission.  The volume discrepancies are clearly visible from both charts Figure 8 shows the data volumes for the 128K overflights as a function of Mars LMST \(Local Mean Solar Time 128 kbps Return Link Data Rate 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0:00:00 6:00:00 12:00:00 18:00:00 0:00:00 Local Mean Solar Time ODY MRO PHX Re q uirement:  30 Mb p ass  Figure 8 \226 Data Volume By Sol  Figure 9 shows a comparison of data volume predicts vs pass performance values  Figure 9 \226 Volume Predicts vs. Performance  6  C ONCLUSIONS  For ASC, the next step is to achieve a level of database independence.  We look to take advantage of emerging best practices technologies and patterns \(e.g. Hibernate  t o  upgrade our core server function to database independence and our Agent Framework to take advantage of a workflow execution function or language such as the Business Process execution Language \(BPEL  RDE is planned for update with the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\ission.  This will include any required updates to the planning input s \(MSL will utilize a wider range of relay parameters, including higher data rates multiple frequency channels and possibly new modulation and coding schemes and adaptive data rate functionality and a likely major change in the handling of predicts One significant additional RDE improvement proposed is to develop a web-based tactical interface supporting pass utilization requests and tacti cal updates.  Currently, all tactical relay coordination is accomplished via email and phone.  This process could be greatly improved with the upgrade to of a web-based system.  However, if adopted this upgrade would have a large impact on the current operational tactical process and thus must be carefully engineered across a broad user base  Overall we found we were able to accomplish our primary relay accountability goals using our chosen architecture The ASC server held up as a useful way to manage objectrelational transactions over a distributed network, and our event-driven client mechan isms were assembled in a straightforward manner using the existing ASC Agent Framework as well as the DOM message reactor function Our ability to accomplish this broad integration at a consistently low level of funding tells us that these technologies and patterns are worth pursuing as part of further accountability prototype pilot, and deployment activities A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  The work described in this paper was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Californi a Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The authors wish to further acknowledge other individuals who made key contributions to research and development including Marti DeMore, Lloyd DeForrest, Derek Kiang Ashley Shamilian, Lori Nakamura, Mark Palm, Priscilla Parrish and Mike Tankenson
