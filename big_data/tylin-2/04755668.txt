The Effect of Using a Semantic Wiki for Metadata Management A Controlled Experiment   Kai M. H¸ner University of St  Gallen Institute of Information Management kai.huener@unisg.ch Boris Otto University of St  Gallen Institute of Information Management boris.otto@unisg.ch   Abstract A coherent and consistent understanding of corporate data is an important factor for effective management of 
diversified companies and implies a need for companywide unambiguous data definitions. Inspired by the success of Wikipedia, wiki software has become a broadly discussed alternative for corporate metadata management. However, in contrast to the performance and sustainability of wikis in general, benefits of using semantic wikis have not been investigated sufficiently The paper at hand presents results of a controlled experiment that investigates effects of using a semantic wiki for metadata management in comparison to a classical wiki. Considering threats to validity, the analysis \(i.e. 74 subjects using both a classical and a 
semantic wiki\hows that the semantic wiki is superior to the classical variant regarding information retrieval tasks. At the same time, the results indicate that more effort is needed to build up the semantically annotated wiki content in the semantic wiki   1. Introduction  1.1. Corporate metadata management  Effective management of diversified companies implies coherent and consistent understanding of corporate data. Logistics processe s harmonized on a global 
level, global procureme nt s t rateg ies, integrated service management, and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements needs company-w ide unambiguous data definitions Being able to work with high-quality data is pivotal to enable service-oriented bu siness applications [24, p  p increas e the validity of s t rategic decis i ons  29  pp. 23 nd al l o w for hi g h regul at or y compl i a nce  8, p. 5 Metadata of high qu ality are the basis for retrieving, managing, evaluating, and using appropriate information through precise queries, as they increase

Business scenario  In cooperation with a chemical company, we are conducting a Design Research project [10 for developing a central metadata repository. The company is running a global process harmonization project and is planning to establish a central single point of truth for 
master data. In this project, the company needs harmonized and comprehensible data definitions in order to provide guidance for users \(i.e. users of SAP systems maintaining materials, ven dor, and customer master data\rk in newly harmonized business processes. The repository is intended to be used worldwide by about 6.000 users for support purposes A central metadata repository is already in place providing information on company-specific SAP data fields and transactions. This repository is supposed to be used by SAP users for clarifying the usage of par 
ticular SAP data fields, forms, and transactions. However, acceptance and usability of this tool are low Some problems of the current solution were identified in focus group interviews [3, pp. 153Ö1   information retrieval is too time consuming  search and navigation functionality is poor  information is not up to date  metadata is not integrated with business processes Considering the interview results, the company decided to use a wiki for a new ve

These expected effects are supposed to improve timeliness of information and increase the number of users. However, the evaluation of this assumption is part of ongoing research.

Section 2.2 tainty about the impact of functionality that is only provided by a semantic wiki we decided to conduct a controlled experiment to investigate positive or negative effects of the use of a semantic wiki. This experiment was not intended to evaluate the above mentioned wiki-based metadata repository but to indicate whether or not a semantic wiki is able to overcome supposed drawbacks of a common wiki in general. The intended contribution is to empiri cally confirm supposed effects in order to provide decision support for wiki development projects. An empiri cal evaluation of the mentioned Design Research project and a comparison with the findings presented in this paper is part of future work Considering the interview results mentioned above we decided to focus on information maintenance and information retrieval. Research to date has tended to focus on effects of using classical wikis in corporate context [20, 23, 26, 33, 35 S o far howe v er, t h ere has  been little empirical research on effects of using semantic wikis for metadata management The paper at hand presents the results of a controlled experiment on the ef fect of using a semantic wiki for metadata management In particular, we investigated how enhanced wiki functionality affects 1\ time needed to accomplish certain tasks and 2\ubjects assessments regarding effort and usability. In Section 2, we outline our understanding of metadata and give some background information on \(semantic\ki technology used for the experiment. Section 3 explains the rationale behind the chosen experiment design and gives information on the experimentês implementation and progression. In Section 4, we present the main results of the statistical analysis and we discuss possible threats to validity of the results. Section 5 provides a summary and discusses future work  2. Background  2.1. Definition of metadata  Metadata can be defined in general as data that describe the meaning and the properties of other data demarcating them from other data types, such as transaction and mas recis e ly, we  use the term to determine important characteristics that need to be known for both database and application engineering [7, p. 482 o r general, s e mantically  unambiguous understanding of data within an organization. Metadata, accordi ngly, facilitate identification detection, use, and management of data as they allow an organization to better understand its data sources and definitions. Tozer [31, p  u mmarizes their function by èseeing metadata as the means by which the structure and behavior of data is recorded, controlled, and published across an organizationê. The most comprehensive definition is provided by Marco 22, p. 5 cribes meta data as èall physical data and knowledge from inside and outside an organization, including information about the physical data technical and business processe s, rules and constraints of the data, and structures of the data used by a corporation From a data management perspective, metadata is any information that supports effective use of data including information that can facilitate data management \(e.g. data authenti cation, data sequence, data type, or key field indicators\s and data analysis \(e.g. format for data mi ning, visualization\[2 p. 12   2.2. Wikis and semantic wikis  Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit web page content using any web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has simple text syntax \(wiki markup or wikitext\reating new pages and cross-links between in ternal wiki pages on the fly [5 u rther t ypical feat ures are version control \(history management\ as well as search and navigation functionality. It has to be mentioned that the term wiki does not refer to specific so ftware or technology but to the concept of web based, collaborative collection organization, and provision of information Wikis have become popular tools for collaboration on the web, and many online communities employ wikis to exchange knowledge. For a majority of wikis public or not, primary goals are to organize and to share the knowledge collected [17, p. 2  One of the best known examples of a wiki is the multilingual, free encyclopedia Wikipedia 1 which every user can edit. Due to rather primitiv e features for searching information provided by the Wikipedia software, Krˆtzsch et al pr opos ed a mo re s t ructu red  approach and started an open-source software project to develop an enhanced wiki engine \(i.e. an extension of the wiki engine MediaWiki 2 that is used for Wikipedia called Semantic MediaWiki 3  SMW\sified as a semantic wiki. Both MediaWiki and SMW are mentioned here as they are used for our experiment \(i.e. the classical wikis are provided by installations of MediaWiki, while the se  1 http://www.wikipedia.org 2 http://www.mediawiki.org 3 http://www.semantic-mediawiki.org Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


mantic wikis are provided by installations of MediaWiki and the SMW extension Unlike classical wikis semantic wikis provide a structured representation of their content, mostly encoded in RDF based languages [26, 30, p a s e d on this additional information structure, enhanced search and navigation functionality is provided. As there is no comprehensive classification of semantic wiki functionality, we just provide information on SMW as a representative of semantic wikis. Please note that there are more semantically enhanced wiki engines \(e.g. MaknaWi  n d  IkeW rovidi ng furt her features e.g., f o r collaborative ontology editing or document publishing However, such features are not in the focus of the business scenario mentioned in Section 1.2\or more information, Buffa et al. [1 pres ent a s t ate-of -the-a rt of semantic wikis. A case study on the management of corporate manufacturing metadat a is presented by Muljadi et al. [23, pp. 271. ff  Figure 1 shows a page with information about Gorgonzola cheese that was used in the experiment \(i.e. in the semantic wikis\MW uses additional markup to annotate the content of a wiki page [17, pp. 254 n  the classical wiki, a link from the Gorgonzola page to the page about Piedmont looks like this Piedmont   MediaWiki markup\ith SMW, one can add a meaning to this link by adding some additional markup Production Region::Piedmont  The enhanced wiki engine parses the annotated wikitext and builds a data structure based on the additional information \(i.e a directed graph with a labe led relation \(Production Region\m Gorgonzola to Piedmont Figure 2 shows an SMW special page that is available for all semantically annotated pages. It provides information already available on the content page \(i.e in the Facts about box, cf. Figure 1\ed representation. This extracted information is intended to increase the wikiês usability regarding navigation and information retrieval  3. Research methodology  3.1. Research objective  We conducted a controlled experiment with an AB/BA cross-over design. Background information on this design is given in Section 3.3. Regarding the underlying Design Research project mentioned in Section 1.2 we identified the following two research questions  How is a wikiês usability affected by functionality which is enabled by semantically annotated wiki content  What additional effort is needed to semantically annotate wiki content  3.2. Scenario  As already mentioned, we focus on real-world metadata management scenarios where users are familiar with the underlying data model. One example of such a scenario is company-specific support for an SAP system, where the wiki contains information on how to use specific SAP data fields \(e.g. the sales tax ID as part of supplier master data\ For that reason, we tried to minimize the effort necessary to understand given tasks by using a simple, plain scenario. We chose an ontology about pizzas, which is also used for education and training purposes in the context of ontology editing software [13 o re precis e ly we us ed a s ubs et o f this  ontology: We only selected information about pizzas their toppings, and the spiciness of pizza toppings. We mapped this information to an appropriate wiki representation. The wikis contain pages for several pizzas e.g Pizza Capricciosa e.g Gorgonzola cheese cf. Figure 1\. Relations \(e.g. between pizzas and their toppings\ determined by the page content \(classical wiki\by semantic annotations semantic wiki\pectively  Figure 2.

3.3. Experiment design  Regarding our research questions, we needed to take measurements on comparable s ubjects under different conditions: a classical wiki on the one hand, and a semantic wiki on the other ha nd. To control the treatment of subjects, we designed a co ntrolled experiment [4, p 181 f following p a rameters more detailed information on the tasks T Find T Collect and T Link is given in Section 3.4  Independent variables For two tasks \(T Find T Collect  we controlled the wikiês functionality. Subjects had to accomplish the same tasks with both a classical and a semantic wiki. For another task \(T Link  controlled the scope of the task \(adding classical links vs. semantic annotations  Dependent variables We measured the subjects assessments regarding effort and usability in trying to accomplish the given tasks by taking ratings on an interval scale \(1Ö9\ermore, we measured the time needed for each task to be accomplished We consider these variables to serve as proper indicators of the shortcomings identified with regard to the metadata repository currently in use \(cf. interview results mentioned in Section 1.2 Given three tasks and three dependent variables, we can formulate nine null hypotheses for our controlled experiment  No difference in time needed to accomplish T Find  T Collect and T Link   No difference in effort ratings for T Find T Collect and T Link   No difference in usability ratings for T Find T Collect  and T Link  To achieve higher statistical power [19, p. 80 o  ensure internal validity [28, pp. 35 ff  use a repeated-measures design for our controlled experiment. In a repeated-measures design, subjects receive two or more treatments modification of controlled variables\Even with high subject variability there will be almost always a positive correlation [14 p. 18  A shortcoming of repeated-measures design is the occurrence of carry-over effects [9, p. 31 a rr y-o ver effects can occur in two ways: practice effects and sequence effects. In our context, practice effects can occur because subjects might not have used a wiki in the past. Therefore, it is plausible that in the second run subjects will exhibit better performance than in the first run because they had some practice with a wiki, regardless of the wiki type When confronted with a sequence effect, the effect of the first treatment persists and thus contaminates the measurements on the second treatment. Results of our analysis to identify carry-over effects are given in Section 4.2 To err on the conservative side, we used a counterbalanced repeated-measures design \(i.e. an AB/BA cross-over design [28, pp. 46Ö50 i t h count er balancing, all possible orders of treatments are considered and subject groups are randomly assigned to one of the treatment sequences. The effect of counterbalancing is to spread the unwanted variance arising from interference through practice or sequence effects [4, p 212Ö228 u rthermo re, an explicit tes t for carry-o ver  effects is conducted during our analysis to check if any such effects persisted despite the counterbalancing  3.4. Experiment implementation  Participants were members of an applied research program as well as employees and consultants that are involved in data quality management. All subjects could be classified as interested in the context of data quality. We had a set of 279 potential participants from more than 80 different companies, which were randomly assigned to two groups \(GA, GB\Random assignment can be regarded as a method of experimental control because it is assumed that over large numbers of subjects uncontrolled fact ors are distributed evenly over the treatment conditions [34, pp. 261Ö262  The experiment was conducted in April 2008. Each subject received an email containing a short introduction, the URLs of two wikis \(i.e. a classical and a semantic wiki\n online survey. As we used an address repository that was built up during the last two years, the address data was not free of errors Since 31 emails could not be delivered, the size of the sample was reduced to 248 \(128 in GA and 120 in GB\ome technical problems during the first two days, 13 data sets could not be considered in the analysis. Finally, we received 74 analyzable results \(39 in GA and 35 in GB\ch corresponds to a response rate of 29  It has to be noted that there are smaller sample sizes in some cases as not all subjects accomplished each task. For some statistical calculations, it is also necessary to consider only those subjects that have accomplished a task in both the classical and the semantic wiki For each participant, we prepared two wikis: a classical wiki and a semantic wi ki. We used the wiki engine MediaWiki for both wikis. For the semantic wiki we also installed the SMW extension \(cf. Section 2.2 Copies of the wikis used \(i.e. the classical wiki 4 and the semantic wiki 5 vailable online. Furthermore, we asked all participants to assess the wikisê usability and the effort needed to accomplish certain tasks. \(cf. dependent variables in Section 3.3\ Besides the ratings we implemented a logging ex tension for the wikis that   4 http://wiki.iwi.unisg.ch/experiment/ClassicalWiki 5 http://wiki.iwi.unisg.ch/experiment/SemanticWiki Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


saves timestamps for several wiki actions \(i.e. view edit, and save actions\ these timestamps, we could estimate the time necessary to accomplish the given tasks. The following subsections describe the three tasks each subject had to accomplish in both the classical and the semantic wiki  3.4.1. èFind Contentê Task \(T Find  We asked the subjects to go to five wiki pages. For this task, the classical wikis only provide indexed search functionality and links between wiki pages. Besides search and link functionality, the semantic wikis also provide a factbox that summarizes semantica lly annotated data of a page cf. Figure 1\ further navigation support mentioned in Section 2.2 \(cf. Figure 2\In order to simulate corporate scenarios, we asked to visit semantically related pages \(e.g. a specific pizza and afterwards a pizza with a similar topping  3.4.2. èCollect Informationê Task \(T Collect  We asked the subjects to collect all wiki pages about pizzas that have at least one hot topping \(referred to as hot pizzas The spiciness information was only given in the page text of a pizza topping. In the classical wikis, the subjects had to read all pizza topping pages for identifying hot pizzas. In the semantic wi kis, we additionally provided a GUI based interface fo r intuitive assembly of ask queries  3.4.3. èLink Informationê Task \(T Link  We asked the subjects to add missing links into a specific wiki page The text without links was already included. In the semantic wikis, subjects also were asked to semantically annotate the added links  4. Results and analysis  4.1. Statistical background  For this paper, we have visualized some of the most important results by means of box plots [32, p. 39 ff The box of a certain plot contains 50  of the data points. The lower / upper border of the box marks the 25  75  quantile. The lower / upper t-bar marks the most extreme data point which is not more than 1.5 times the length of the box away from the lower / upper edge of the box. Outliers from the above scheme are visualized by circles. The median is marked with a thick line We used the non-parametric one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test [12, pp. 10 o r eval uat i o n  as we did not assume a cert ain distribution \(e.g. a normal distribution for both data sets\n general. Besides the tolerance for different distributions, this test is also recommended for both ordinal and interval scaled data despite introductions to assume constant spacing for the rating scale, we cannot assume homogenous interval scaled data\ The statistical power of the Wilcoxon test is in the worst case 13.6  smaller than the power of the corresponding t-test [12, p. 13 red uction  factor is considered for all power calculations in this section. However, all statistical power calculations result in values close to è1ê. The reason for these high statistical power values can be found in very small pvalues \(cf. Section 4.3 We only conducted statistical analysis for T Find and T Link because we did not receive enough comparable data sets for T Collect cf. Section 4.4  4.2. Cross-over analysis  We applied the Hills-Armitage approach [11, p. 12Ö15 to analyze carry-over effects of the experiment. This regression method is recommended to analyze data from cross-over experiments [28, p. 47 roach  is based on treating the experimental sequence order as a dummy variable that, in our case, takes the value è<1 for data points of GA and è1ê for data points of GB The test is legitimate regardless of whether just one or both of the effects \(i.e. practice and sequence effect\ is present. However, the test is incapable of discriminating between the two effects [18, p. 4 After a re gression analysis, the gradient coefficient of the regression line can be seen as an indicator of a carry-over effect. More precisely, one can determine the significance of the effect by calculating the distance of the coefficient from zero. Table 1 shows the cross-over analysis results \(abbr.: RC \(regression coefficient standard error\, t \(t-value P \(probability > |t|\E treatment effect\, CE \(carry-over effect\ Significance level: 5   Results of the regression analysis presented in Table 1 indicate that the mean difference between values of GA and GB \(i.e. the values for TE in column RC significantly different from zero for all dependent variables \(i.e. p < 0.001 for effort, usability, and time This suggests that the semantic wiki is superior to the Table 1.

classical wiki regarding T Find and T Link A more detailed analysis of the treatment effect is given in the following subsections. A signi ficant carry-over effect could not be determined: All p-val ues \(cf. values for CE in column P\ are greater than the chosen significance level of 0.05  4.3. Analysis of T Find and T Link   For the analysis, we considered 61 subjects \(32 in GA and 29 in GB\rding T Find and 62 subjects \(32 in GA and 30 in GB\rding T Link Table 2 summarizes mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficients, and results of a significance analysis regarding T Find and T Link abbr.: CW \(common wiki\W \(semantic wiki SD \(standard deviation\orr \(Spearmanês rank correlation coefficient\. P-values calculated by the Wilcoxon test all are smaller than 0.001 Figure 3 and Figure 4 show box plots of the subjectsê ratings regarding usability and effort for T Find  The box plots show that subjects using a semantic wiki gave higher ratings regarding usability and lower ratings regarding effort than su bjects using the classical wiki. These results are cons istent with th e time measurements: Almost all subjects accomplished T Find faster in the semantic wiki than in the classical wiki \(cf. Figure 5\e results are strongly significant \(p 0.001 for effort, usability, and time Results for T Link are also significant \(p < 0.001 for effort, usability, and time\, yet this time it is the other way round. The box plots in Figure 3 and Figure 4 and the scatter plot in Figure 6 show that subjects using a semantic wiki gave lower ratings and needed more time to accomplish T Link than subjects using a classical wiki. Besides a signifi cant distance, there is a significant positive correlation between each pair of data sets Values of the Spearmanês rank correlation coefficient for all data set pairs are given in Table 2 In summary, all null hypotheses regarding T Find and T Link have to be rejected. Regarding any threats to validity \(cf. Section 4.5\emantic wiki performs better for T Find while it shows lower performance for T Link   4.4. Analysis of T Collect   Regarding T Collect we have too few comparable data sets for significant statistical anal ysis. Obviously, the given task was too hard to accomplish. Only six subjects tried to accomplish T Collect in the classical wiki. Any of these subjects achieved an acceptable result. With the semantic wiki, 61 subjects \(31 in GA and 30 in GB tried to accomplish the task. It is interesting to note that all seven subjects of GA \(remember: classical wiki before semantic wiki aborted the experiment were lost while trying to accomplish T Collect in the classical wiki. Subjects of GB also aborted T Collect in the classical wiki but continued with trying to accomplish T Link    classical wiki semantic wiki classical wiki semantic wiki 02468 Find Task                                   Link Task low\                                usability rating                                \(excellent Figure 4.

Another interesting finding is the number of 42 correct results for T Collect in the semantic wiki. It has to be noted that the task had to be accomplished by creating an ask statement. Though the se mantic wiki provides a query interface to support subjects \(cf. Figure 7\ it is remarkable that 61 subjects tried to use this interface and 42 of them \(24 in GA and 18 in GB\ucceeded in doing so. Despite this interesting observation, we cannot draw any significant conc lusion whether or not to reject the null hypotheses regarding T Collect   4.5. Threats to validity  It is the nature of any empiri cal study that assumptions are made which later on restrict the validity of the results. In this subsection, we discuss these assumptions that impose threats to internal and external validity  4.5.1. Internal Validity Threats to internal validity are those factors that may affect the value of the dependent variables apart fr om the independent variable 15, p. 7 Effects re gardi ng s e lection, maturation instrumentation, and presentation can be considered as not relevant when using a crossover design with random allocation to sequence which is designed to avoid these problems [28, pp. 35 us ing a cross-over design is problema tic if there is an interaction between sequence and treat ment. Considering this threat, we conducted a cross-over analysis that is discussed in Section 4.2. Results of this analysis do not indicate significant cross-over effects  4.5.2. External Validity Threats to external validity are those factors that may limit the applicability of the experimental results to indus try practice [4, p. 360  Our experiment considered three threats to external validity: participant representativeness, scenario representativeness, and task representativeness Participant representativeness is an issue, because all participants are more or less interested in the topic of data quality management. This characteristic cannot be assumed in general for users of wiki based metadata management software. Nevertheless, the familiarity with \(semantic\is was low: All subjects stated to read on Wikipedia, but nobody had ever written some content. Only twelve subjects \(16  knew the MediaWiki software before the experiment, only one stated to use it. Regarding SMW, only three subjects 4  stated to know the software Of course, the scenario cannot be generalized to industrial practice except to pizzeria businesses. Regarding this threat, we need to discuss whether or not the complexity of the scenario can be viewed as a valid representation for a real-world scenario. One important factor at this point is th e knowledge of real-world employees about their specific tasks. For our experiment we tried to compensate the missing knowledge about the arbitrary scenar io with lower co mplexity. However one valid argument threatens the results regarding T Find  The semantic wiki can only expedite a userês work process, if the information needed is semantically con 150 200 250 100 150 200 250 classical  wiki \(seconds semantic wiki \(seconds Group A Group B Figure 5.

nected \(due to the search and navigation support that is based on semantic annotations When discussing the representativeness of the experimentês results, we must admit that the effects identified are certainly dependent on the software that was used. All tasks defined addressed specific features of SMW \(i.e. extracted information to enhance navigation, the query interface, or the SMW markup  4.6. Discussion  We identified a signi ficant difference between the performance of the classical wikis and the performance of the semantic wikis, while certain threats to validity have been taken into consideration. As the experiment was intended to provide decision support as to whether or not using a semantic wiki \(i.e. the SMW extension for a MediaWiki based wiki is beneficial for metadata management, we discuss the results in the context of the Design Research project mentioned in Section 1.2 The experimentês results indicate that information retrieval is faster and easier when extending MediaWiki with SMW. At the same time, the effort for information maintenance increases due to additionally needed semantic annotations in the wiki content. When trying to draw conclusions from these findings, one has to consider specific characteristics of the corporate scenario focused. If the intended effect is to facilitate content creation, a classical wiki would be the better choice. If the wiki is supposed to facilitate information retrieval and the utilization of contained information, a semantic wiki is preferable. Besides th is consideration, technical aspects \(e.g. integration of wi ki content into further applications [23, 26 ve to be taken into accou nt  In the business scenario mentioned in Section 1.2 the clear focus is on information retrieval as the number of content users exceeds the number of intended content authors \(i.e. 6.000 vs. 90\. For that reason, the identified effects concerning T Find are regarded to be more important than increasing effort for content authors. However, the evaluation of these expectations is part of future work. At this point, we just want to outline how the experimentês findings can contribute to given wiki development projects  5. Conclusion and future work  The paper at hand presents the results of a controlled experiment on the effect of usi ng a semantic wiki for metadata management. Taking into consideration threats to validity, we have come to the conclusion that the semantically enhanced wiki engine SMW is superior to the classical variant \(i.e. a classical MediaWiki installation\ regarding information retrieval tasks. At the same time, the results indicate that in the semantic wiki more effort is needed to build up the semantically annotated knowledge base, which is a precondition for semantically enhanced functionality. These results are being discussed with referenc e to a real-world metadata management scenario in order to disclose how to draw conclusions for practice Further work needs to be done to assess whether the findings are representative for real-world scenarios The Design Research project mentioned is intended to observe comparable effects for the specific use case of a metadata repository with SAP support information Besides the effects investigated in our experiment, the effects of deep metadata integration into business processes have to be examined. The possibility to provide a machine processable representation of collaboratively created wiki content that can be easily integrated into enterprise systems \(i.e. a SAP system supposed to have a positive effect on process performance \(i.e. process fide lity, process cycle time  7.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
