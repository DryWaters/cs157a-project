We suggest a security protocol for IP-WSN based on Secure Sockets Layer SSL\ We have developed IP-WSN sensor node hardware with 16-bit MSP430 MCU including 116 KB Flash and 8 KB RAM and implemented IP-WSN software stack and lightweight SSL components. The resource consumption is around 64 KB of Flash and 7 KB of RAM when it is used that ECC for key-exchange and authentication, RC4 for data encryption, and MD5 for hashing. And it takes total 2 s for a full SSL handshake and a 127 bytes packet transfer. It can make IP-WSN secure and be used for the public and private services such as military observation healthcare, and home-network  Keywords6LoWPAN; IP-WSN; SSL; Sensor Networks Security I  I NTRODUCTION  In the last several years, a lthough many WSN technologies have been developed in the world, they were based on local networks. Therefore it is hard to merge and reuse those preconstructed sensor networks for various services with different protocols as a larger scale network due to its heterogeneity. IP-WSN is popularly recognized as a global sensor networks infrastructure by combining IPv6 technology with WSN so that all the sensor nodes, equipped with IPv6 address and TCP/IP stack, ca n communicate with any peer through the Internet and take advantages of IPv6 technology like security, mobility, and so force. Also it shares a basic network stack and can be used irrespective of applications for services and is interoperable with other IP-WSN However, for the majority of public and private services of WSN such as military, home-netw ork, and healthcare, security is important and should be supported. The global accessibility of IP-WSN through the Internet causes additional security issues, so IP-WSN needs a more reliable security protocol to prevent it from potential threats using more powerful devices having abundant resources like PC, laptop, and PDA. IETF 6LoWPAN working  group  16 also  recognizes the importance of security and actively discu sses based on a draft for the security consideration [3 u t still n o  so lu tion h a s been  suggested We suggest lightweight Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\[1  for IP-WSN security using ECC [5  i n st e a d of  R S A fo r  key exchange and authentication RC4 for data encryption, and SHA1 and MD5 hashing algorithms and present it in this paper. This lightweight SSL is small enough to be operated in the highly restricted device re sources including 16-bit MCU 116 KB Flash memory, and 8 KB RAM with embedded OS IEEE 802.15.4 PHY/MAC, light weight TCP/IP stacks and 6LoWPAN adaptation layer. It also provides basic security functions like privacy, integrity authentication, access control and non-repudiation; it can be interoperable with existing SSL protocol used in the Internet SSL is the most commonly used and verified security protocol on the Internet today. It is used for many popular services and applications including all kinds of well-known web browsers, e-mail, on-line banking, stock trading, and ecommerce h ybr id cr yp tog r aph y co m b in ing public-key cryptography for key-exchange and authentication with symmetric-key cryptograp hy for data encryption and integrity. Public-key cryptography is widely believed to be beyond the capabilities of WSN devices. However, we have implemented IP-WSN and lightweight SSL software using around 64 KB Flash and 7 KB of RAM. And it takes total 2 s for a full SSL handshake and a 127 bytes packet transfer In this paper, we describe the results of our IP-WSN project named Sensor Networks for All-IP worLd \(SNAIL\ and present the Security of SNAIL \(SSNAIL\ using lightweight SSL. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section  001\012 reviews related work. Section  001\013 introduces SNAIL Section  001\014 particularly describes SSNAIL. In Section  001\015\000\017  we measure the resource consumption and evaluate the performance.

It has a around 50-70 KB footprint, but still is not small enough to be adapted into IP-WSN devices; targets 32bit and 64-bit CPUs, for inst ance, ARM processor family MIPS, PowerPC, i386, and x86-64.

However, it only supports RSA and targets somewhat powerful platforms which can operate Windows  XP  Windows CE, Linux, and other popular OS. In addition, 60 KB memory footprint is still quite large to run in IP-WSN devices E  Sizzle  d e n dto-end security architecture for the embedded Internet.

It is a small footprint implementation of a HTTPS stack that brings the well-established security properties of SSL and a relativel y small set of cryptographic algorithms to the embedded Internet. It uses MD5 and SHA1 hashing algorithms which is mandatory for SSL; RC4 for bulk encryption because of its high speed, compact code size widespread support in existing SSL deployments; and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman \(ECDH\r key exchange [6 and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm \(DCDSA 7 e idea u s ing ECC with ECDH-ECDSA-RC4-MD5 is similar to this paper.

In addition, a new working group, ROLL Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks\7 is making efforts to provide an independent IP-based routing solution for low-power and lo ssy networks. Recently, many researchers and companies incl uding ArchRock, Cisco, Dust  Network  and  other  organizations  are  actively  participating in standardization activities. Those working groups’ efforts are based on the fact that the size of a network stack, compressed packet length, and energy overh ead are reasonable compared to ZigBee [21 Howev e r, those wo rk ing grou p s still h a v e  n o t  solved the remaining security issues III   SNAIL Sensor Networks for All-IP world \(SNAIL\s a project to implement IP-WSN platform, ma ke a widespread test-bed and build real services in th e planet. SNAIL includes compact IP-WSN software which can be used in highly constrained sensor node hardware with 16-bit MCU, 8 KB RAM, and 116 KB Flash. In this section, we describe our SNAIL platform in detail A  SNAIL sensor node Our SNAIL sensor node runs on two different platforms which are OSAL \(Operating System Abstraction Layer\ [2  of TI solution and ANTS EO SL \(Real-tim e and Embedded Systems Laboratory\n ICU. This paper handles implementation on the former platform 1\  Software SNIAL sensor node software meets RFC4944 whose subjects are "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks   As s h o w n i n t h e \(a  f Fi gu re 1 a 6LoWPAN adaptation layer locates between a network manager and a lightweight TCP/IP stack.

We have designed our own

 F IGURE 2  B OOTSTRAPPING AND ROUTE ADVERTISEMENT  bootstrapping and network prefix advertisement mechanism As shown in Figure 2, auto-configuration is performed just after an association process between two nodes and the joining node then registers itself to a PAN Coordinator so that the PAN coordinator can manage all the registered nodes in a PAN and advertise the network prefix periodically. From this method, the overhead of multicast messages of ND can be considerably reduced since only unicast messages are utilized in the process The components of our embe dded TCP/IP stack support a lightweight IPv6  ICMPv6  TCP and UDP which are in gray in the \(a\ of Figure 1. Especially, ICMPv6 supports echo request/reply messages and neighbor discovery messages For the security of SNAIL platform, we implemented a lightweight SSL protocol which supports MD5 and SHA1 hashing algorithms \(those are mandatory in SSL standard RC4 for data encryption because of its high speed, compact code size, and widespread support in existing SSL deployments; and ECDH-ECDSA for key-exchange Lightweight SSL is located between TCP/IP stack and an application layer as can be seen in the \(a\ of Figure 1 2\  Hardware   We have developed SNAIL sensor node hardware shown in the \(a\of Figure 3. The sensor node hardware includes MSP430FG4618 MCU, 8KB RAM, 116KB Flash memory and CC2420 RF. It is powered by two AA-sized batteries and contains one USB port for communication between coordinator and gateway, and debugging B  SNAIL gateway The implemented gateway was designed to handle basic requirements of IP-WSN and further research topics with rich resources. We describe the details as follows 1 Software  The SNAIL gateway has three major roles: 1\v6 packet delivery from the Internet to the corresponding sensor node and vice versa; 2\ network prefix handling; 3\ network management  For  the  first  role  the  gateway  supports  an IPv6 stack at least as well as IPv4 stack since IP-WSN is based on IPv6. Because IPv6 networks are not fully deployed throughout the world  IPv6  packets should also pass through  F IGURE 3  SNAIL SENSOR NODE  A  AND GATEWAY  B  HARDWARE  T ABLE 1  SNAIL HARDWARE SPECIFICATION  Type Sensor node Gateway Processor 8MHz TI MSP430 Embedded Intel Pentium M/Celeron M RAM 8 KB 512 MB Storage 116 KB Flash 8 GB Memory Network IEEE 802.15.4 RF TI CC2420, 250 Kbps 2 022 10/100 Mbps Ethernet I/O RS232C RS232C, LPT USB USB 2.0 compliant Port 2 022 USB 2.0 compliant Port Power AA size battery APM1.2, ACPI support  the IPv4 networks. For this purpose, the gateway network stack is equipped with both IPv4 and IPv6 stack and facilitates 6to4 tunneling to support an IPv6 packet delivery via IPv4 networks. In addition, the gateway uses the same adaptation layer as the sensor node as shown in the \(b\of Figure 1. Its objective is to compress and decompress the incoming and outgoing packets for transparent packet delivery The gateway helps the resource limited PAN coordinator node to manage the entire PAN in performing the second and third role. The coordinator is connected to the gateway with a serial cable to communi cate each other so that it can request the gateway to handle work on behalf of it. The gateway as a first device retrieving a network prefix in both cases of IPv6 networks and 6to4 tunneling shares the network prefix with the PAN coordinator and periodically advertises a network prefix a nd notifies all the sensor nodes of its aliveness by using unicast messages. Likewise maintaining all information of sensor nodes in the gateway makes it much easier to cope with network management works. For instance, development of network management applications and tools is far more convenient than retrieving node information from the PAN coordinator and information residing in the gateway is useful for numerous applications such as commissioning, neighbor discovery time synchronization, SNMP, security, and other research subjects  2\  Hardware   The developed SNAIL gateway hardware is shown in the b\of Figure 3. The gateway hardware includes Embedded Intel Pentium processor, 512MB RAM, and 8GB CF memory to run Fedora core 7 and two USB ports for a serial communication between the gateway and the PAN coordinator and WLAN interf ace. The PAN coordinator is stacked on the gateway board to reduce volume

IV  SSNAIL The security technology for IP-WSN should be small and operated in the highly restricted device resources including 8 or 16-bit MCU, around 100 KB Flash memory, and less than 10 KB RAM with embedded OS, IEEE 802.15.4 PHY/MAC lightweight TCP/IP stacks and 6LoWPAN adaptation layer. It also must provide basic functions like privacy, integrity authentication, access control and non-repudiation; and it can be interoperable with existing security technologies used in the Internet As shown in Table 1, SNAIL sensor node hardware has 16bit MCU, 8 KB RAM, and 116 KB Flash. The size of SNAIL software is 48 KB and it uses around 7 KB RAM with 1280 bytes full TCP/IP fragment and reassembly. We have tried to implement lightweight SSL whose code size is under 30 KB and memory occupation is under 500 bytes to be operated in this SNAIL platform because SSL is the most commonly used and verified security protocol in the Internet today and used for many popular services and applications including all kinds of well-known web browsers, e-mail, on-line banking, stock trading, and e-commerce. SSL is a hybrid cryptography combining public-key cryptography for key-exchange and authentication with symmetric-key cryptography for data encryption and integrity. Public-key cryptography is widely believed to be beyond the capabilities of WSN devices However, we have designed lightweight SSL using ECC instead of RSA for key-exchange and authentication, RC4 for data encryption, and SHA1 and MD5 hashing algorithms A  SSNAIL architecture While SSL has been verified and identified as a good security solution in the Internet, it has been recognized as being too "heavy-weight" for highly restricted sensor networks devices due to its public-key cryptography IP WSN, by contrast, is designed to make global sensor networks equipped with IPv6, so that it has more load by the technology to harness IPv6 to WSN. SSNAIL is a part of SNAIL project to implement lightweight SSL which can be operated in the highly constrained devices with 30 KB Flash and 500 bytes RAM usage Figure 4 shows the SSNAIL architecture we have implemented. It is an IP-WSN which provides end-to-end secure communication to any peer in the Internet. The sensor node has a globally unique IPv6 address and IP-WSN stacks including ECC based lightweight SSL which can be worked as both server and client side SSL. Therefore, sensor node can securely communicate with others in the intra-PAN \(Personal Area Network\ and inter-P AN through the Internet The gateway plays the same role as the SNAIL gateway described in Section  001\013 It delivers IPv6 packets including SSL protocol messages from the Internet to the corresponding sensor node and vice versa The PAN coordinator is connected to the gateway with a serial cable to communicate with each other so that all the peers in the IP-WSN and Inte rnet can securely communicate via the gateway using TCP/IP and SSL The host and monitoring syst em are in the Internet, but usually applications used in the Internet like well-known web browsers  do  not  support  ECC  based  SSL today, so that we  F IGURE 4  SSNAIL ARCHITECTURE  have developed a simple monitoring program on which ECC based SSL is enabled B  ECC-based Lightweight SSL SSL allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. SSL provides endpoint authentication and communications privacy over the Internet using cryptography It is flexible enough to accommodate different cryptographic algorithms for key-exchange, encryption and hashing We  have  implemented  a  relatively  small  set  of  cryptographic algorithms. We chose the ECDH-ECDSA based ECC for keyexchange and authentication due to its resource efficiency and speed. We selected RC4 for data encryption due to its compact code size and speed. The MD5 and SHA1 hashing algorithms which are mandatory for SSL are implemented for the derivation  of  the  master  secret and symmetric keys. In addition, we implemented RSA, DES, and 3DES cipher suits for the code  size, memory usage, and performance comparison It can be chosen and built at the compile time. Our lightweight SSL meets SSL 3.0 standard  1\  Lightweight SSL components Figure  5  shows  the  software components of our lightweight SSL included in the SNAIL stack. Its record protocol involves using SSL in a secure manner and with message integrity ensured. To this end it is used by upper layer protocols. The purpose of the record protocol is to take an application message to be transmitted, fragment the data which needs to be sent, encapsulate it with appropriate headers and create an object ju st called a record, which is encrypted and can be forwarded for sending under the TCP protocol. It takes intensive time and power to encrypt and hash messages so that we selected RC4 for encryption and MD5 for hashing The alert and cipher change protocol are simple message handling protocols meeting SSL standard. The first one is to convey session messages related with data exchange and functioning of the protocol. And second one is to cause the pending session state to be established as a fixed state These messages and any other  SSL  messages are transferred 
1115 


 F IGURE 5  SNAIL  lw SSL COMPONENTS  using the record protocol The handshake protocol constitutes the most complex part of the SSL protocol. It is used to initiate a session between the server and the client, authenticate the parties to each other, and negotiate cryptographic algorithms and keys. For the key-exchange and authen tication, we chose ECDHECDSA  operation  of  ECC  using  the  160-bit  curve secp160rl which provides the same level of security as the RSA using 1024-bit key for the faster computations and lower memory and power consumption. According to Gura et al. [9 bit ECC key-exchange operati ons are 13 times faster than 1024-bit RSA decryption operations on the "mote  2\  ECC-based full handshake The \(a\f Figure 6 shows the full handshake operation based on ECDH-ECDSA, as speci fied in h e cli e nt sends the server a ClientHello \(a-1\essage containing cipher suite including ECDH-ECDSA, RC4, and MD5 as well as version, random, and session ID. The server, in response to the ClientHello message sends a ServerHello a-2\essage, containing the same set of fields as the ClientHello message so that the parties negotiate a cipher suite. The server’s Certificate \(a-3\essage contains the server’s ECDH public-key si gned by a certificate authority using ECDSA. If the server’s certificate is correctly verified with the ECDSA signature validation the server is considered authenticated, and then the client sends the server ECDH public-key using the ClientKeyExchange \(a4\essage. Next, the client sends a ChangeCipherSpec \(a5\essage to confirm the messages so far received and to verify whether the pending data is correct, and then sets up the pending set of algorithm parameters and keys into the current set of the same. Then the client sends the finished message, which is first protected with just negotiated algorithms, keys and secrets This is to confirm that the negotiated parameters and data are correct. The server in response to the client sends the same  message  sequence. If the finished message is correctly read by either party this confirms that the transmitted data, negotiated algorithms and the session key are correct. After that, each party uses its own ECDH private-key and the other’s public-key to perform an ECDH operation and arrive at a shared premaster secret. Both entities then use the premaster secret to create a master secret which is used to derive cipher keys initial vector, and Message Authentication Code \(MAC keys for data encryption and authentication by the record protocol 3\  Abbreviated handshake As shown in \(b\of Figure 6, the client sends a ClientHello  F IGURE 6 ECDH _ ECDSA BASED FULL HANDSHAKE  A  AND ABBREVIATED HANDSHAKE  B  MESSAGES MARKED WITH AN ASTERISK ARE OPTIONAL  b-1\ message including the non-zero session ID of the session to be resumed. If the server then has that session information cached and is willing to re-establish the connection under the specified session state, it will send a ServerHello \(b-2\essage with the same Session ID value If a session ID match is not found, the server generates a new session ID and a full handshake is performed V  E VALUATION  The SSNAIL test-bed has been built in the KOREN which is a non-profit research network providing development environment for IPv6 research. To evaluate the feasibility of deployment both in IPv4/IPv6 networks, we located a remote test host in IPv4 networks outside the KOREN and IP-WSN in IPv6 networks of KOREN. 30 sensor nodes were deployed at intervals of more than 5 mete rs in an open area with no obstacles A  Memory Usage We used IAR Embedded Workbench IDE to debug and determine memory usage of SSNAIL software. IAR shows the code memory and static data memory at the build time We also calculated allocated h eap at the code level without considering dynamic situations caused by packet  sizes  and  frequencies  of  applications. We experimented with just SNAIL sensor nodes. And we fixed static RAM size as 7 KB and heap size as 1KB for SNAIL implementation SNAIL basically uses around 7 KB static RAM with 1280 full TCP/IP fragment and reassembly and 422 bytes of heap Table 2 presents memory usage measurements for our SSNAIL sensor node software depending on the cipher suites enabled. These numbers include memory consumed by OSAL, IEEE 802.15.4 PHY/MAC, and IP-WSN software stack; and also include cryptographic algorithms and lightweight SSL components excepting the numbers in the first and second rows for SNAIL. The maximum code size with RSA-3DES-MD5-SHA1 is roughly 64 KB, so

However, the maximum heap usage with same cipher suite is over 1 KB Therefore, we changed TCP/IP fragmentation and reassembly buffer size to 512 bytes and reduced static RAM limit to 6.5 KB and extended heap size to  1.5  KB. It is sure that the TCP/IP fragmentation and reassembly with reduced buffer decreases the packet processing capability ECC-RC4-MD5-SHA1 cipher suite takes the least RAM consumption, which is 6,936 bytes. If the TCP/IP buffer size is set to 1280 bytes, it takes a total 7,704 bytes B  Performance test of SNAIL The performance of SNAIL is m easured by taking average round-trip time in hops for 100 ICMPv6 and UDP echo request/reply packets with which full test data is filled up to 127 bytes; i.e. the maximum frame size of IEEE 802.15.4 As shown in the \(a\re 7, the average round-trip time in hops for both ICMPv6 and UDP slightly increases as the number of hops grows. According to our analysis, two major factors affecting the av erage round-trip time were an asynchronized I/O operation to multiplex both serial and virtual tunneling interface inputs and the sum of transmission rate between the KOREN and a 6to4 relay server and between the remote host and the relay server C  Performance test of SSNAIL The performance of SSNAIL is measured by taking average time in hops for a SSL handshake and 100 roundtrip TCP packets with which full test data is filled up to 127 bytes. As shown in the \(b\ure 7, the average time for an ECC based full handshake and 127 bytes packet roundtrip is 2 s. The experiment using an abbreviated handshake takes around 1 s. And, as expected, an RSA case takes highest time, 8.5 s  VI  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK  We have presented a lightweight security protocol for IPWSN. We have developed ECC based lightweight SSL for the security of IP-WSN in addition to SNAIL platform with OSAL, IEEE 802.15.4 PHY/MAC, lightweight TCP/IP, and 6LoWPAN    adaptation    layer.    The    minimum    resource consumption is around 64 KB of Flash and 7 KB of RAM when it uses ECC for key-exchange and authentication, RC4  F IGURE 7  P ACKET TRANSFER SPEED OF SNAIL   A  AND SSNAIL   B  for data encryption, and MD5 for hashing. In addition, it takes 2 s for a SSL full handshake and 127 bytes packet round-trip This paper contributes to the 6LoWPAN and IP-WSN related research and extends IP-WSN service areas to more critical ones such as military, health care, home-network. For the future work, we will design a low-power mechanism for our SNAIL platform and analyze the result when the lightweight SSL is operated over UDP becau se TCP increases the traffic and the power consumption and UDP is enough for the majority of WSN services R EFERENCES    G.

6.2 Results  Figure 2 shows the overall average results of the BIA maturity assessments of the Belgium and Dutch participants. From this graph, some differences are immediately clear, specifically for skills  governance and scope and architecture Figure 3 shows the results on a deeper level. Based upon these differences, the following analysis can be made  Communications maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.0 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants do not show a lot of difference, also on the level of the individual assessment items shown in Figure 3. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Value measurement maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.7 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable show some difference. On the more detailed level, a substantial difference is shown on the item Formal assessments reviews The direction of the difference, however, is opposite to the expectation. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Governance maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.4 On this variable of BIA maturity, the results show the expected difference that the Belgium participants score higher than the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that especially the prioritization process is scored significantly different The expected difference is therefore confirmed  Partnership maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.2 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable are equal. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Scope & Architecture maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.3 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.8 For this variable the expectation was undecided. The results show a remarkably higher score of the Belgium participants than of the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level this difference shows on all items  Skills maturity Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 For this variable, the results show the expected difference that the Dutch participants score a higher maturity than the Belgium participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that this difference shows on all items, but most strongly on Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness The expected difference is confirmed  Table 5 shows the summary of the results of this exploratory study    0,00 0,50 1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00 3,50 4,00 4,50 5,00 Und e rstand i ng of b u sines s by IT Und ers tand ing of I T b y bu si n e ss Inte r/I ntraorg aniz ati onal lea rn ing K now led ge S ha rin g I T Metr i cs Business Metric s Bal a nc ed M et ric s Formal Assessments/Revie ws Conti n uous Im proveme n Budgetar y Cont r o l IT inves tm ent m a nage m en P riorit iz ation pr oces s Busin e ss per c eption o f IT val ue S hared  goals r isk, re w ards p e nalt i e s Re lat ions hip trus t st yl e Sta nd a rds Ar t iculatio n Ar chit ectu ral inte grat io n D isr upti on from Ch ang es Inn o vation  Entre p reneu rs hip Loc us of Po w er Cha n ge rea d ines s Ab i lity to attract a n d reta i n Netherlands Belgium Communications maturity Value measurement maturity Governance maturity Partnership maturity Scope & Architecture maturity Skills maturity  Figure 3.

Conclusions and limitations  The conceptual analysis of the potential influence of national cultures on BIA maturity provides indications that this influence is indeed more than likely and that its influence is consistent over the different dimensions of culture. Our first empirical exploration provided support for the existence of differences in BIA maturity between countries. More specifically, the differences in scores regarding the alignment domains governance maturity and skills maturity could be explained by Hofstede s cultural differences studies, with governance maturity scoring higher in Belgium and skills maturity scoring better in the Netherlands. One a more detailed level, it was expected and confirmed that the portfolio management process received better in Belgium and that Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness clearly received better scores in the Netherlands Our study did not, however, confirm all expected results. The domains communications maturity  value measurement maturity and partnership maturity did not show the difference in scores that were expected. In fact, the scores showed no clear substantial at all. A potential explanation for this result could be the small sample size. Therefore, further study should be made, based on larger samples, to further explore and study the impact of cultural differences on business and IT alignment scores. Such studies can expand the comparison between Belgian and Dutch results, but could also address cultural differences between other nations worldwide  References  1  A VOLIO   B  K AHAI   S    D ODGE   G. \(2000 E-leadership Implications for theory, research, and practice Leadership Quarterly, 11 \(4\, 615-668 2] B ATENBURG R. \(2007 E-procurement adoption by European Firms: A quantative analysis Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 13, 182-192 3  B IRGELEN   M VAN   R UYTER   K.D  J ONG   A.D    W TZELS M 2002 Customer evaluations of after-sale service contact modes An empirical analysis of national culture's consequences  International Journal of Research in Marketing, 19, 43-64 4  B OND M.H. \(1984 Hofstede's Culture Dimensions ; An Independent Validation Using Rokeach's Value Survey Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, Vol. 15, No. 4, 417-433 5  C HAN   Y.E  H UFF   S.L  B ARCLAY   D.W AND C OPELAND D.G 1997 Business Strategy Orientation, Information Systems Orientation and Strategic Alignment Information Systems Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 125-150 6  C HAN   Y.E. \(2002 Why Haven t we Mastered Alignment?

Automated Windowed Coefficient Trending Earlier we attempted to find explanatory models whose coefficients changed over time in a predictable way This would then let us predict future coefficient values for these models and apply these trended models towards future estimates The problem was that we were not able to find such stable models at least manually We automated our search for stable models by building a system we refer to as the Automated Coefficient Trend Search ACTS tool A patent is currently pending for the method implemented in this software Against the Far Out data set ACTS is designed to automatically permute fields run chronologically-windowed regressions with the chosen fields establish linear and nonlinear trends for the resulting coefficients and then use these trended coefficients to estimate a future set of data ACTS also automatically tries up to seven different transformations on any given dependant or independent variable The length of calibration windows and the increment between them are automatically varied ACTS establishes most promising coefficient trends and also rates the performance of predictions done using trended-coefficient models With so many parameters transformations windows length and intervals to evaluate ACTS needed to search a huge problem space Despite assembling a cluster of 8 computers to run ACTS if necessary for months the problem still required pruning Each run of ACTS was therefore restricted to producing models with a different number of variables between 3 and 15 We quickly found that the best models contained very few parameters due to over-fitting on wider models permitting us to pare down the problem Neural Netv 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 I  M The system produced literally thousands of forecasts for each project If the distribution of project costs and project costs estimates were known a confidence interval could be computed using the cost estimates and a method such as Bayesian model averaging used to integrate them 5 Not having a priori knowledge of this distribution we chose instead to use the inter-quartile range of the estimates that is we looked at whether the estimate fell between the first and third quartile of the estimates The top and bottom 25 were disregarded because there are always outliers and it was presumed the system could work well even when many of the individual estimates were not very good Given the very large number of estimates produced by the system literally thousands or tens of thousands depending on the settings we could afford to squander a few Results were best with only three variables per equation In eight out of 31 projects 26 of the projects the project's actual costs fell within the inter-quartile range of the forecasts of costs for that project produced by the ACTS models For 30 out of 31 projects the inter-quartile range of estimates was made up of over a thousand estimates while for the 3 1st project only 446 estimates were part of the inter-quartile range The significance of these numbers is revealed in the next paragraph When equations with four variables were used only one of the true project costs fell within the inter-quartile range of forecasts produced by ACTS When more than 4 variables were used none of the true project costs fell within the interquartile range From this we concluded that ACTS performed best when only 3 variables were included in each model Using more variables appears to produce over-fitted models Aork MRE By Lauch Month Chronologic 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Launch Month Since 1960 Figure 10 Neural network magnitude of relative error sorted chronologically 11 space 


incapable of accurate forecasts Of course the wider the inter-quartile range of forecasts the more likely it is that the true forecast will fit within that range But how parsimonious is the range As figure 11 shows in about 55\2600 of the inter-quartile ranges created by ACTS the 3rd quartile of estimates is 50%0 larger than the Ist quartile of estimates For about 90\2600 of the ranges created the difference between the I't and 3rd quartile is less than 75\2600 and for 97\2600 of the projects the top of the range is 100 or less than the bottom of the range 45\2600 of the true project costs falling into the new range When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 50\2600 the range estimates encompassed 77\2600 of the true project costs In the end however we felt that the adjusted ranges were too wide for practical use Adaboosting using binomial logit classifiers Short for adaptive boosting the Adaboost algorithm 6 is a type of machine learning algorithm where a set of classifiers are adjusted to favor previous misclassifications These classifiers are actually other estimating algorithms Percentage of Time 3rd Quartile no more than XO/o Greater than 1st Quartile 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 25 50 75 100 Figure 11 Variation in ACTS-produced estimates measured between 3rd and 1st quartile Percentage of time True Cost Falls in Range Produced by ACTS 3 variable ersion 90 8070 60 5040 30 20 10 l 0 Interquartile  or10  or25  or50  or75 Figure 12 The effect of widening the estimating range measured by  of estimates now lying within Of the eight projects that fell within the average percentage difference between the 1st and 3rd quartile was 55 with median of 52 This indicated that the inter-quartile range might be too restrictive We therefore proceeded to widen the range of cost estimates for each project multiplying the ISt quartile estimate by 1 X%0 and the 3rd quartile estimate by 1  X using various Xs In each instance we compared actual project costs to estimates produced and determined how frequently the actual fell into the range of estimates Results are summarized in figure 12 When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 10 32 of the actual estimates fell within the new range Extending each of the range boundaries by 25 resulted in Adaboost works by iteratively weighting observations so that poorly classified ones are given more weight during the next iteration With the algorithm focused on improving estimates for exceptional cases it is somewhat more sensitive to noisy data and outliers though less likely to over fit We chose to test this approach due to the latter property The boosting algorithm seemed structured particularly for binary decisions though we are seeking to estimate a continuous variable cost We therefore staged the method by estimating cost bands so that the estimate for each band reverted to a binary decision The algorithm would separately estimate whether an observation was 12

This exercise required a number of decisions about how many classifiers to use how many bands to estimate and how many variables should be used in the models All these choices were made empirically Models with 3 variables were marginally more accurate than those with 4 More models seemed generally better to a point so we used 99 models We also used 22 cost bands checking whether an estimate was above or below 12M 35M 44M and so on through 519M It is interesting to note that there was no data scarcity-induced limit on the number of bands we could have used since each was estimated using all observations lying above and below and not just between bands As with the neural network training was carried out using 52 missions from the 1960s through 1996 and testing occurred on 58 missions from 1996 through 2007 The trend in estimate deviation would again permit us to gauge whether predictive accuracy decayed over time Results are shown sorted by cost in figure 13 and chronologically in figure 14 Figure 13 shows that MREs are large and negative for missions at 56M actual mission cost and below Above this point results are mixed although not as poor as at the very low range There seems to be no degradation in predictive accuracy as projects increase in scale The correlation between estimates and actual values is approximately 0.66 Sorted chronologically in figure 14 no trend can be seen as estimates go farther out up to 11 years as was seen with the neural network Again this may have been due to the normalization process in which we mapped each variable to its percentage ranking based on future and past minimum and maximum values basically embedding the effect of time within the factors being input to the model It also may be due to a relatively stable era Weighted combinations of simple models A persistent problem in multivariate estimation methods which has been mentioned is that a model may be produced that over fits the observations used for calibration It would thus not be adequately generalized to estimate out of that sample Techniques such as jack-knifing and outlier removal can mitigate this We chose another approach developing models that were little more than simple rules of thumb and then combining these in a weighted manner so each would have a say in the estimate The weightings were formulated using Excel's Solver to minimize estimation error on a set observations lying 15 to 25 years before the test set We refer to this method as continuous boosting because as with the Adaboost method it too involves a mix of classifiers that are combined according to their performance against a set of test observations Unlike Adaboost which solves a binary problem the algorithms are here estimating on a continuous scale Also unlike Adaboost the models are re-weighted rather than the observations to maximize prediction Before presenting results it is worth noting that we ran a control test where all variables from the simple rules of thumb were combined into a single model and run on the same windows performance was nowhere near as good We chose the models by hand guided by the criteria that they should be relatively orthogonal rely on differing parameters so they could each contribute a unique influence to the combined result Figure 15 shows that MREs are mostly positive though for lower cost missions errors are regularly negative and large Continuous Boost MRE By COST M M 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Cost Figure 15 Continuous boosting magnitude of relative error sorted by actual cost 14 


CONCLUSIONS Given that this project was intended to estimate missions lying 10-15 years out we structured it differently than one intended to estimate contemporary projects A variety of conventional techniques were not used as we felt they would over fit training observations and thus not be suitable for prediction We also were not sure which approach would work so we tried many We heavily favored ensemble methods where models are combined because we surmised that any one model could not be guaranteed to have the best view of the future However a single neural network ultimately yielded the most competitive results Another finding was that methods built upon simple models such as with three variables generally did work best not surprisingly because they were less likely to over fit calibration data A graph of the three best methods is shown in figure 18 with estimates for the same missions sorted by cost For the neural network calibration occurred until just before the results shown for continuous boosting calibration occurred no more recently than 15 years prior to the results and for Adaboost calibration also occurred up until the results shown A graph sorted by year is not shown we think it instructive that no results seemed to degrade over time As mentioned but obvious from figure 17 the neural network performs best followed by Adaboost and then continuous boosting It is interesting to note that the three cases in which the neural network goes haywire and predicts too low also correspond to worst performances for the Adaboost method pointing to exceptional data points We will be further investigating these regularly errant results and other outliers which may result in estimating improvements ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was carried out under Small Business Innovation Research contract FS9453-05-C-0023 with the Air Force Research Lab The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge Judy Fennelly and later Ross Wainwright our technical points of contact at AFRL for their continuous support and encouragement Our contract officer Timothy Provencio also provided invaluable assistance Our critical seed stock of data was provided by Joseph Hamaker who previously was Director of NASA Headquarters Cost Analysis Division and now is Senior Cost Analyst with SAIC Ainsley Chong and Dale Martin USAF Ret also lent considerable assistance with data gathering APPENDIX A MISSIONS COLLECTED Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Satellite Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer Adeos Advanced Communications Technology Satellite Advanced Composition Explorer Alexis Amos-I AMSC-1 Anik El Anik E2 Applications Technology Satellite-I Applications Technology Satellite-2 Applications Technology Satellite-5 All MREs Lu 1.00 0.75 l 0.50l 0.25 l 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75-2.00oi v 1   Cost o N X  X~~~~~Cl Figure 16 Comparison of estimating error for three best methods 15
