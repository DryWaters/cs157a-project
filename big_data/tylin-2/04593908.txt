The Research of Parameters Automatic  selection Reduction Tikhonov Regularized SVM Yongqi Chen 1,2 Qijun Chen 1  1  Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University , Shanghai 201804  E-mail:ziliu7781@163.com   2  College of Science and Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211 Abstract Tikhonov regularized SVM is a kind of new SVM which can convert multi-class problems to be single optimized problems. Since SVM has some limitations in disposition of big data collection, this paper puts forward a new reduction Tikhono v regularized SVM by utilizing pruning algorithm to gain reduction data collection. Meanwhile, the paper applies genetic algorith m to make automatic selection from the balance parameter and kernel function parameter of Tikhonov regularized SVM. The experiment proves this newly improved Tikhonov Regularized SVM is more advantageous for classifying precision and train rate   Keywords SVM, pruning algorithm, genetic algorithm  Tikhonov 012\015   1,2   1  1 012\015\015   201804 2 015\015\015   315211     Tikhonov 0123 -.456!"#$%789 ABC4-.DEFGHIJKLMNO>DPQR'\(NO Tikhonov ST'UVDWX Tikhonov  4YZ   4_ a bR  cd De f E F g h R i j k K 9 N O 4 Tikhonov 4YZ   l mn o_ D pq Gr st ul 4 Tikhonov vwxd\\+,cdUVyz{43|}7   DIJKDijkK   1   015Ä&'\(ÅÇÉÑÖÜEáàâ%ä\015 4çéD V Va p n i k 4  SVM sñQ{*3XózUK4 1-3 Def Rûü†h 4 7íE!"#$%&89 4D 0R SVM z¢£†h D SVM kK7≠ÆDpØ†h 4!"#$%*+,kK∞¨z  1 9 svm  9 SVM 4≤aU k   2   k  SVM  D 1 0',D k-1 0',Dn  k  k 2°+,π-.D+,@\∫ªÜE 0yzº+,^<4Ω,S 2 9 svm  9'4≤aUK k lmææøHD      06DZ11202   2   1    k k 2+,äD û9∫ªÜElm+,7 stDÀæ\(kKÃÕ;ëÜ4 SVM mDvw\\+,4kµ$ôD Dxd{◊èŒœ7ÿŸCD'⁄\015 u!"#$%≠·^<D 0≤a123 -.D„‰ïÂ13 k  D 2005 D Oladunni gh Tikhonov  SVM yzÁ\0124ËqÈÍÎÏGîÌ0cO4ÓœD Tikhonov hXîï13 k  5,6 D WX13 k Az,4<=D D 012@:UK\íE SVM 4 0èıˆ‘Def˜¯R°–64˘≤.Dyz”‘GîO1D˙˚Öè3œD¸zz˝˛4 h  7ÏWX'–}ÔçAzÜED      E  hÌ4   012 Def  vwÜE 978-1-4244-2114-5/08/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE 9338 Proceedings of the 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation June 25 - 27, 2008, Chongqing, China

 The citation semantic similarity S cise of documents A and B can be summarized in the following formula    6  1  1 1    2 1      M i B N A N L i S cise S   7   2  2 2 2 2  1 1 1 2    iN R rtiN N rciN N i R rti N rci N i R rti N rci N Max L i S       where M Min N A  N B d  N = Max N A  N B each citation cluster has only one label S i L could only be 0 or 1; However, if we allow a citation cluster to have multiple labels, then S i L could be a fraction. For example, if one cluster C a1 in A has labels L a L b L c  and another cluster in C b1 in B has labels L a L b L d  then S i L will be 2/3 R ij   i=1 M; j=1 N is defined as follows  8        rj R ri R Max rj R ri R Min ij R    Assuming  A B N N  for every citation cluster in B we try to find a corresponding citation cluster in A which has the highest similarity using Formula \(7\, and calculate the meta-ratio using Formula \(8\hen we use Formula \(6\et the overall similarity of citation semantics of documents A and B see Fig. 3  4. Experimental results and discussion We downloaded Pubmed Central \(PMC access articles from e ch os e t w el v e cate g ories  corresponding to topical j ournals as our original clusters as shown in Table 2. We evaluated our results according to these clusters  Table 2.

This data set was used to develop our citation semantics approach of document clustering and also to obtain appropriate weights for Formulas \(5\d \(3\or \(4\The document sets involved in each combination were used as the ground truth for evaluating our clustering results. Note that the combinations in Table 3 are only from the first eight categories of Table 2. The remaining four categories were held back to test the robustness of our approach  Table 3.

In other words, we performed K-Medoids clustering using the similarity measure specified in Formulas \(3\d \(4\with W 1 0 and W 2 1. Before clustering using different combinations of strategies, we did clustering by using title only, citation clustering only, and co-citations only. The average F-Measures are 29.9%, 59.3%, and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


 35.8%, respectively. Intuitively, we expect to find a higher F-Measure on combining the three approaches Also, since using citation clustering results in the highest individual F-Measure among these three, a higher weight on citation clustering is likely to give better results The average F-Measures in Fig. 4 show that when the weights W 3 W 5 W 6 are biased towards citation clustering \(note high values of W 5 e get the highest values of the F-Measure, which coincides with our expectation. In other words, when we assign more weight to the semantic similarity between reference clusterings, we get better results of document clustering. Assigining more weight to the similarity between titles or to number of co-citations does not improve document clustering.  For example, the FMeasures of 10:1:1, 1:1:10 and 10:1:10 are all less than that of 1:1:1; the F-Measure of 1:10:10 is better than that of 1:1:1, but less than that of 1:10:1      Fig. 4. Citonomy Clustering F-Measure  Among the weight ratios 1:5:1, 1:10:1, 1:15:1 1:20:1, 1:25:1, 1:30:1, the first two settings work the best as shown in the following tables. From Table 4 and Fig. 4 we can see the F-Measures of 1:15:1, 1:20:1 1:25:1, and 1:30:1 are all the same. At this point, the values 15, 20, 25, and 30 for W5 are so large that the similarities based on titles and co-citations have been rendered inconsequential. To summarize, the contribution of similarity of titles and similarity based co-citations is small, but significant    Table 4.

This can be seen by the clustering result using either one alone - 75.9% versus 63.8% for this training data set. Another reason is that W 3 W 5 W 6 1:5:1 or 1:10:1 implies a high value for the Citonomy measure.

 Fig. 5 F-Measure of clustering using combination of vector space and Citonomy with W 3 W 5 W 6 1:15:1   It is clear that the more weight we assign to vector space measure, the closer the result is to that of using vector space measure only; the more weight we assign to the Citonomy measure, the closer the result is that of using the Citonomy measure only. Fig. 5 confirms this by plotting the average F-Measure of different W 1 W 2 ratios with W 3 W 5 W 6 1:15:1 To test the weights we get from the training data we generated another set of corpora with same categories shown in Table 3 but with different papers and sizes.

Conclusion and future work  We have presented a new approach to document clustering in this paper that utilizes citation semantics as a similarity measure. Using experimental analysis we have demonstrated that the accuracy of clustering on incorporation of citation semantics is improved by 5-10  compared to using only the vector space measure An important consideration in machine learning applications is the cost benef it ratio. Ideally, the gain in performance should be worth the complexity of the approach. The non-optimized Citonomy pipeline used in this paper took about twice the time that the use of VSM alone takes. Though the use of Citonomy entails the use of several additional steps, these operate on a small subset of the data space, can be fully automated and several of the steps can be executed in parallel Therefore, running time can be potentially improved especially with removal of the combinatorial steps that were included for comparative validation. Further since this is an independent modular addition to the process of clustering, and essentially a pre-processing step for generating a pair-wise distance measure for documents with citations, it can be combined with essentially any clustering approach. Given that the resulting improvement is substantial and the extra cost is a linear addition that can potentially be minimized we feel the cost benefit ratio is high enough for this approach to be useful in practice While the degree of improvement may depend on the choice of documents to be clustered,  we speculate that the present report represents a lower bound and the contribution of Citonomy is likely to be higher in differentiating between subsets of closely related documents, in contrast to the coarse problem of journal-wise classification evaluated here. This is because Citonomy may be seen as an attempt to include semantics that stem from a consideration of spatial locality of terms, and from explicit links specificied by the authors of documents. Both these factors should lend themselves to a higher degree of discernment, as they go beyond considering only the independent occurrence of terms in a pure VSM approach. Further, the approach may be used as a distance measure not just for research papers, but essentially any documents that embed citations to other documents Future work may include the use of this approach on diverse types of document sets to establish its robustness. It may also be refined by using underlying domain ontologies for systematic recognition of matching terms, rather than performing only string matching as in the present work. Running time can also be improved by automating connections between the various steps and by judicious use of the values for the parameters that yield the best performance for the training sets   6.
