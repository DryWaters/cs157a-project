 Varying Load Big Electric Current Rectifier Autocontrol Method Study  Qin Xiaoli, Guo Yanqing, Qi Zaikang, Wang Rui, Liang Sheng Beijing Institute of Technology Nanyang Technological University Email: pg22917073@ntu.edu.sg   Abstract  In this paper, a novel control scheme of the application of PWM method in the rectifier power source control is proposed. The proposed method is to control the rise or fall in current and some switch signals, which are affected by the varying load. Although the PWM is used broadly, the 
method how to determine the PWM pulse width in the rectifier galvanization production line is seldom to be concerned. The computer + PLC control mode is also used in the control process and it is the most popular control mode until now. It is called SCADA system \(supervisory control and data acquisition system\. The improved performance of the control strategy is illustrated by the experiment, and the result curve is presented in this paper I  I NTRODUCTION The selenium rectifier is the most important equipment in the plating production line. It is known that the control quality of the rectifier current influences the quality of galvanization 
product directly. As we know, the traditional way to control the current is mainly by hand, which may cause the great current fluctuation phenomenon. In this case, the rate of eligibility may drop to 50% or even lower. It is urgent for us to consider a more practical way to control the rectifier\222s current automatically. In order to improve the product quality in this paper, we propose a new way to control the rectifier\222s current based on PWM [1   The rectifier power source what we used is made in Switzerland. The main body of the device is soaked in a cylinder, so it is impossible to view clearly the interior structure. Many process variables need to be controlled such as temperature, liquid position, pressure, current, voltage 
cargos signal and so on. The rectifier provides a control interface for us, and we can not change the rotational speed of the rectifier motor in the process of the current adjustment. If only the PID controller is used, it is impossible to control all the parameters in the process. That is the reason that we didn\222t choose the overshoot control. In another hand, we once tried to use the DSP to control the process. But the main drawback of this method is that the control cycle is too long, which can not satisfy the adjustments\222 flexibility request So in this paper, we develop a method to control the current rise, fall and switch signals automatically. And we use the computer + PLC control mode, which is the most popular 
control mode until now [4   In this way, by monitoring the change of the load, it is realized to control the whole process As the load usually varies, the determinate of the pulse width becomes a key part in the control process To determine the pulse width, the first step is to analyze the characteristic of the rectifier power source. The adding electricity process is assumed to be linear for convenience Secondly, the mathematical model of the current adjustment is obtained. Lastly, the WINCC software is used to control the pulse width based on the obtained model [2    There are certain relationships between the current of the power source and the size of the plates, the ingredient and temperature of the liquor, the distance from the pole to the 
anode and so on. So the whole process is explained as follows: when the size of the plates increases, its resistance decreases, which will lead to the current to increase very fast In addition, after a long time, conductivity of liquor may change remarkably, which also affect the value of current What\222s more, the phenomenon of ebullition caused by the plating process also influences the conductivity of liquor. So the varying current can be considered as the varying load [5   The main contribution of this paper is that the theoretical method is realized in a real practical system. Our method can determine the pulse width based on the varying load, which makes it easy to real-time control. The experiments 
demonstrate a good performance of our proposed control scheme II OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF R ECTIFIER POWER SOURCE  The type of the rectifier power source of the galvanization production line is IDS Z1-01 12000/12, the rated voltage is 380V, the rated current is ~380A, the rated frequency is 50HZ, the output voltage is 0-12V and the output current is 12000A. In order to adjust the current, the output voltage is changed by dragging glide rheostat. When the current of the rectifier is adjusted by hand, we usually directly use the rectifier switch knob, the rectifier rise knob and fall knob. The switch knob of the rectifier is used to control the opening and 
closing of the rectifier. The rise knob of the rectifier is used to control the dynamo running clockwise, which makes the output voltage increase. The fall knob of the rectifier is used to control the dynamo running anticlockwise, which makes the output voltage reduce The ascent part of the current is quite important when the current is adjusted. The rise and the drop part are driven by the same electrical machinery, so they should have the same characteristic. Therefore the characteristic of the ascent part is 978-1-4244-1718-6/08/$25.00 2008 IEEE 


 mainly considered. The rise knob of the rectifier is driven by a square-wave \(square-wave represents the open and closure of the knob\. The bestirring time of the square-wave is the transient time that the current rises from zero to maximum in the production. In order to ensure sufficient electric motor movement, the rise knob is closed when the current achieves 10000A. The experimental results are shown in Figure 1 a b  Fig.1. Rectifier square-wave drive result As seen from Figure 1, after the rectifier turns on the electrical source, the rise knob of the rectifier is opened for h seconds and it is closed until the current achieve 10000 A There are four stages in the whole process. At the beginning the current increases slowly. Then, it begins to increase very fast after the electric motor runs steadily. The third stage is the inertia increase-stage in t  The switch of the rectifier is connected with the PLC DO block, and the output current is transmitted to the configuration software WINCC by the PLC AI block Considering the control algorithm may be complex, the whole system's control strategy is programmed and compiled under WINCC C-SCRIPT, which is capable to speed up the development progress. The desired value of the current is set directly through the configuration software. To the different work pieces or different production situations of one work piece, the desired value of   the current can be revised In the practical control, the PLC is connected with the rise and the fall knobs of the rectifier power source, as well as the current gathering input end.  The computer loaded with the WINCC system is connected with the PLC. When it works the desired current is obtained by the computer and compared with the actual current, and the pulse width of PWM can be figured out by the computer. Then the WINCC controls the PLC work by using the proposed algorithm. The PLC turns on the relay. Then the relay turns on the scene switch, which drives the scene power source to work In the computer, configuration software includes internal variable and external variable. The internal variable is used in calculation and the external variable is used in the PLC connection, the external variable has DO, DI, AI and AO and so on, which are the correspond parts of the PLC Configuration software is installed in the computer. The PLC is connected with the computer by the communication cable. The configuration software itself has communication function with the PLC. Therefore, it is very easy to transmit the calculated result to the PLC PLC DO block is directly connected to the switch of the rectifier, and the DO block equates to a switch. When the control command in DO block is one, DO block opens the corresponding rectifier 2\ The questions should be considered in the control process a. The influence of the varying load on the control system The products that the entire production line produces are various, which results in the final loads are also various WINCC PLC DO Rectifier PLC AI Output Setting  t=0.7s h      002 the fast ascent-stage which has the slope tan 003 the inertia run-stage which has the slope tan 004 and the steady stage  III. R ECTIFIER E LECTRICAL SOURCE AUTOCONTROL DESIGN  1\ The Control Scheme Ascertain To realize the control of the rectifier current precisely, the strategy of the closed loop control is adopted into the whole system. The block diagram of the automatic control system is shown in Figure 2    Fig.2. the Schematics of Control System 001 after the rise knob of the rectifier is closed. The last stage is the steady stage. The slow increase-stage is according to approximately small slope straight line, and the time of which consumes is about 2 seconds. The fast ascent-stage can be approximately seen as a big slope straight line, and the time of which consumes is decided by the current finally. Because the tests are carried on under the biggest load t 001 0.7 second basically indicates the time that the motor needs to run after the rise knob of rectifier turnoff. Considering the influence of the temperature to motor and the control reliability, in practical, we need maintain surplus, so we take t 001 1 second. When the current is in the steady stage, it fluctuates near to the stable value, and still has the increasing tendency. The reason of the fluctuation is that the solution is in the state of circulate mix when the plating piece works in the solution, and the non-uniform of the solution causes the load to have the small fluctuation, which brings to the current fluctuation. But the reason of current\222s increasing tendency is that the galvanization process will heat up the plating solution, which will promote the activeness of the plating solution, result in the impedance decreasing and cause the current to ascend gradually. Based on technological requirement, in the practical control, the range of the current fluctuation should be within the stable state value \26150 ampere It is clearly from figure 1 a, each section of the rectifier's response is approximately a straight line. Therefore we carry on the subsection linearization to the non linear curve of Figure 1 a. After linearization, rectifier response includes the slow increase-stage which has the slope tan 


 4 1  40 20  tf 1   re fftf  When the method of realizing the current adjustment by the voltage adjustment is used in the rectifier, to the same desired current, the ascending velocity of the big load product is faster than the small load product b. The influence of the steady state current fluctuation to control system As it can be seen from work characteristic of the rectifier the current well adjusted still has the fluctuation phenomenon In order to stabilize the operating current of the products, the rectifier should be monitored at every moment in the practical control c. The requirements of control rapidity and control precision In the galvanization process, the power supply time of the product is longer, so in the longer power supply period, the transient current fluctuation has no great influence on the product quality. Therefore at the premise of the guarantee control precision, it is the basic principle of this control to raise the speed as fast as possibly 3\Control strategy design The mathematical model of the current adjustment value is shown by formula \(1  nTtftfTtftftf 212\006 40 we need to adjust 2 T which is shown in the formula \(6  327\001+\006\212\006 Ifftff re r  4 Where I 005\005\001\261\327\001+\212\005\001+\001\327 31 3 1 2 1 7.0\\(\2\(\\(\\(2  1 The first item of the formula \(1\ is the current adjustment quantity in the slow increase-stage 001 is the slope of the section namely 212 T  is the time of this section. The third item is the current adjustment quantity which is caused by the inertia of the rectifier electrical machinery  3 tf 004 tg tg If i 004 tg tg is a constant and determined by the system structure, which is near to 0.3 through calculating the gathering data. The actual current examination value r f is the difference value between the desired value e f and the inertia adjustment value i f which is shown in the formula 3  ier fff 212  3  The least scanning period of the configuration software WinCC is 250ms.The actual gathering current can not satisfy the critical condition absolutely, so the remainder of the procedure scanning period is kept, by which the pulse width time 1 T is ascertained, as formula \(4\ shows 001 is the slope of the section namely 261 A.  To ensure the current control precision, the current is adjusted when it surpasses the desired value 20 261 A. The upper limit of the exact adjustment is 40 261 A. In order that the current value will not surpass the precision scope in the fine adjustment process 3 T is determined by the formula \(5  005\001\327 7.0  2  In the formula \(2 i f is the current adjustment quantity caused by the electrical machinery inertia, and I 212  2  6    4\ Program flow The entire control procedure is programmed and compiled by using the C-Script under WINCC, and the execution time of each loop is 250ms. The flowchart of the procedure is shown in Figure 3 001 is the slope of the section namely 006\212\006 e ftf  5  After the current fast adjustment, if the current value is not in the fine balance scope, namely 002 tg calculated by the gathering datum, and the time of the current adjustment is 2s in this section.

Therefore, it is necessary to control the pulse width time 1 T accurately. Firstly we compute the current adjustment quantity which is caused by the inertia of the rectifier electrical machinery. It is shown in the formula 2 003 001 is increase quantity of each second of the current fast adjustment stage which can be obtained by the actual gathering datum The 003 001 is the increase quality in each second of the current fast adjustment stage, therefore the current increase quality in 250ms is 1/4 of the I 001  Fine adjustment time 3 T is related with craft. The current precision of the galvanization craft is 50 002 tg ftf T r

The experimental result is shown in the Figure 4     Fig.4. a     Fig.4. b Fig.4.a is the manual adjustment curve, and Fig.4.b is the automatic control curve. From two charts, it is obvious that the automatic control process is stable, and has more advantages than the manual adjustment, which proves the feasibility of the control strategy V  CONCLUSION Although the PWM is used broadly, as far as the method how to determine the PWM pulse width in the rectifier galvanization production line is seldom to be concerned. In this paper we have applied the method into a real practical system. Our method can determine the pulse width based on the varying load, which makes it easy for real-time control in the rectifier galvanization production line The computer + PLC control mode is also used in the control process The experiment results indicate the good performance of our proposed control scheme For practical application, this method may have some problems, as it control the system mainly based on the referenced value and the measurement value in the scene which may be not accurate. When we use this method in practical system, there may be the situation that the error between the measured value \(gathered by PLC\ and the real electric current value \(displayed by the rectifier power source\ is large and even nearly a few hundred amperes. This case brings on some mistakes in the control. One of method to solve this problem is to use two parallel PLC AI ports to measure the signal in scene. If the values of both ports are different, there may be some faults in the system, and then the system should be stopped and checked This method can be used in such situation that the process variables are controlled by an on-off variable. For example the liquid position controlled by electromagnetism valve, the automatic adjustment of hydraulic vehicle and the heat preservation box and so on A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors are thankful to Nanyang Technological University, in particular Pro Wen Chang yun for his support to this project.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
