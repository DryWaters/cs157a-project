and range scene data with excellent resolution in both dimensions Each 2-D range slice image contains the de\255 tected photo-electrons at each pixel for a particular range The photo-electron counts are directly proportional to the re\255 turn signal intensities incident upon the detector Range estimation errors of a scene can occur in a 3-D LADAR due to several system factors including the optical spatial impulse response photon noise and atmospheric dis\255 tortion These factors cause the scene's intensity to spread or blur across pixels The intensity spreading corrupts the cor\255 rect pixel intensities at each 
range gate by mixing intensities with neighboring pixels thereby providing false intensity val\255 ues to the range estimator Without blur compensation the range estimates would then be inaccurate to a degree depend\255 ing on the blur severity The focus of this paper is to improve 3-D LADAR range esti\255 mation by implementing 2-D image restoration filters to de\255 blur each detected 2-D range slice image Due to simplicity and quickness this research effort implements two linear im\255 age restoration filters Wiener and inverse filters Considering the blur due to the optical system impulse re\255

1 INTRODUCTION There will be errors within the 3-D LADAR system from the receiver noise and atmosphere that degrade the ability to per\255 form post-processing to include parameter estimation and im\255 age formation The most common errors are due to the optical system's impulse response photon noise  and atmospheric distortion The goal of this research is to improve range es\255 timation and image quality by applying image restoration fil\255 ters e.g spatial filters Section II describes the

system model and Section III devel\255 ops the range estimator for a general waveform and imaging scenario Following Section IV defines the deblurring filters Finally results are presented in Section V with concluding remarks in Section VI 2 SYSTEM MODEL This section describes the physical 3-D LADAR model Fig\255 ure 1 shows the sensor operation resulting in a data cube of spatial and range information In simple terms the LADAR detector array transmits a pulse and receives an attenuated time-delayed version of the transmitted pulse Each detector in the array transmits 
and receives a version of the waveform shape sampled per the range gate Thus models can take ad\255 vantage of this fact and perform range estimation on a per pixel basis The LADAR target is a scene with bar targets at one range and the remainder of the scene at a different range The true bar target range is 1000 m with the rest of the scene at 998.8 m Figure 2 shows an image of the scene with the white areas corresponding to 1000 m and the dark areas to 998.8 m

  10 is the availability of the ver tical feed line system. As was already mentioned there were severe problems with manufacturing this key element Therefore, it was decided to investigate separately the performances of the other key elements of the breadboard antenna, and to manufacture two test antennas without vertical feed line system The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Ku-ba nd stacked patches. The objective of this test antenna is to measure separately the performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements \(see Figure 25 terminate at the edge of substr ate, so that 8 connectors can be attached. In combination with the prototype 8x1 OBFN a Ku-band phased array antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured perform  Figure 25 Breadboard Ku-band antenna array with 8x8 feed network Dual-frequency test antenna The first test antenna consists of a multilayer stack with Lband slots and 8x8 Ku-band st acked patches. The bottom side of this test antenna is shown in Figure 26. The properties of L-band antenna elements are measured via connectors at the edge of the multilayer stack \(see also Figure 26\e Ku-band antenna elements are measured via sl ots in the feed substrate  Figure 26 Bottom view of test antenna one, with feeds for L-band slots at edges of multilayer stack Figure 27 shows the measured return losses of two ports of the L-band slots. The observed resonance frequency is about 1.55 GHz, and the measured bandwidth is approximately at 1 Ghz. These measured performance almost satisfies the requirement s for the receive band of the L-band antenna  Figure 27 Reflection coefficient of L-band slots in dualfrequency antenna stack The properties of a Ku-band antenna element in the dualfrequency test antenna stack were measured as follows. An artificial slot was made in the f eed substrate in order to have access to the ground plane of Ku-band antenna elements Then, a small semi-rigid cable wa s attached to the feed of the Ku-band element and to the ground plane via that artificial slot. Some pre liminary results of these measurements are given below Figure 28 shows preliminary measured data of the return loss of a Ku-band antenna element where all L-band connectors were terminated with appropriate 50 loads. It can be observed that the return loss is rather high in the frequency band from 10.7 to 12 7 GHz. However, it should be noticed that the surrounding Ku-band elements were not terminated. Furthermore, it appeared that the return loss 


  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
