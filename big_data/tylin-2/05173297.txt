I n du c e dV o i d i n g b e l o w and i n c o p p e r  V I A 222 s w i t h a di a m e t e r of  80nm integrated in a k=2.5 material was studied. The focus was on the early phase of the voiding process. To accelerate the degradation, test structures with big metal plates below and/or above the VIA were used. We found two degradation mechanisms in which one dominated below and the other dominated above a certain temperature. The first mechanism has an activation energy of 0.9eV and is the result of interface-diffusion driven by a stress-gradient. This mechanism was more pronounced below the VIA, but was significant in the VIA as well. The second mechanism has an activation energy of 1.2eV, which is argued to be driven by grain boundary diffusion due to a vacancy gradient 
in and above the VIA. To explain both mechanisms, an addition to the traditional stress-creep model is proposed and fits our data well. Additionally, it is discussed that VIA\222s connected to the center of big metal plates above and below the VIA are less susceptible to SIV compared to VIA\222s connected to line ends either below or on top of the VIA. We support our argumentation and analytical modeling with Finite Element Modeling Keywords- BEOL, Copper, Stress-Induced-Voiding, Voiding Below VIA, Voiding In VIA, FEM I   I NTRODUCTION  Stress-Induced-Voiding \(SIV\ is one of the predominant failure mechanisms of multi-layer on-chip interconnects. SIV is the result of vacancy movement driven by stress-gradients in 
and around VIA\222s that connect different metal layers. These gradients are the consequence of a thermal mismatch between the metal and the surrounding materials. Stress relaxation leads to vacancy movement, formation of micro-voids and void growth, potentially resulting in non-operational devices [1   SIV can happen both below and in a VIA. To get voiding below a VIA, the main diffusion path of vacancies is the copper/cap interface and a reservoir of vacancies needs to be present in the metal layer under the VIA [1   To g e t v o i d in g  in  a VIA, the main diffusion path is the copper/barrier interface and a reservoir of vacancies needs to be present in the VIA 
itself [3,4 L ite ratu re r e p o r tin g o n  d a t a w ith SiO 2 as intermetal dielectric \(IMD\ mainly describe voiding below the VIA as the main cause for failure and voids in the VIA were mainly attributed to non-optimized VIA-processes [5 R ecen t s t u d i es  however show that more severe stress gradients are present in/above the VIA when integrated in porous low-k materials making the voiding in the VIA more apparent [4,6,7 SIV is the result of vacancy movement driven by a stress gradient. At low temperatures, this stress gradient is high, but the thermal activation is low, while the opposite holds at higher temperatures. As such, unlike other BEOL degradation mechanisms, SIV cannot be accelerated by the application of higher temperatures. Degradation data at different temperatures 
are needed to understand the complex balance between stress gradient and thermal activation of vacancies A common way to accelerate SIV is in the design of the test structures. Typical SIV structures consist of big metal plates below or above a VIA [1,5,6 or  of l o n g m e t a l l i n es w i t h V IA 222 s  connected to the center of these lines [8  C a re m u s t be tak en  when extrapolating the result of such symmetrical structures to the real \(asymmetrical\e where VIA\222s are connected to line ends This paper summarizes a detailed study of the temperature dependence of SIV both below and in copper VIA\222s with a diameter of 80nm integrated in a low-k material \(k=2.5\. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical test structures were studied. The 
focus in this study was on the degradation mechanism of SIV in these materials. Hence, the early phase of the voiding process was studied, i.e where the VIA-resistance increases by a few up to about 10 percent II  E XPERIMENTAL  A  Test material Dual damascene copper structures were integrated on 300mm wafers in a SiOCH CVD low-k dielectric \(k-value 2.5, porosity ~25%, E-modulus ~9GPa\. A 5/25nm SiCN/SiCO etch stop layer \(E-modulus ~100 GPa\ was used between M1 and VIA/M2-level. A 3/3nm TaN/Ta barrier was used between copper and dielectric.

This was done by cutting up the wafer in 24 different pieces that were divided into 6 groups in such a way that within-wafer effects were avoided \(figure 2\. Each group contained ~20-25 die\222s and was stressed at 150, 175, 200, 225, 250 and 275 \260C respectively. Measurements were taken after 4, 9 and 16 days of storage. An absolute shift in the resistance per VIA has been used as drift criterion D  Finite Element Modeling A 3D finite element model of the three structures shown in figure 1 was created in ANSYS Multi-Physics. All materials were considered to be isotropic linear elastic solids. The material properties of each material were determined using internal data III  R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  Figure 3 shows the absolute drift/VIA for the three different structures annealed at temperatures between 150 and 275\260C for 9 days. Two different regions are observed for all three structures. The drift/VIA in region I \(< 225\260C\ shows a peak while region II \(>225\260C\hows a steady increase of the degradation as a function of temperature. The peak in region I is highest for the M1-plane structure, but is significant for the M2-plane and the Kelvin structure as well.  Also, the location of the peak in this region is different for the different structures The steady increase of the drift in region II is more significant for M2-planes and Kelvins compared to M1-planes. It is also remarkable that there is no temperature at which the drift is zero, indicating that a true stress free temperature might not be present or a mechanism which is not stress-driven plays a role in the degradation process A  M1-plane structure shows a higher drift in region I compared to M2-plane structure It is expected that voiding will happen below the VIA for the M1-planes as the M1-plane acts as a vacancy source and a stress-gradient under the VIA accumulates these vacancies under the VIA [1  F o r th e M2p lan es  v o i d s a r e ex p ect e d t o  happen by vacancy accumulation in the VIA. Vacancy sources here are expected to be in the copper/barrier interface and/or vacancies in the copper itself [3,4  Earlier publications argue that the voiding in a VIA is due to non-optimized VIA processes [5  M o r e r ec en t  lit er atu r e  on  the other hand, argues that the introduction of materials with a low E-modulus introduce a bigger stress gradient in the VIA making the structures more vulnerable to voiding in the VIA 4,6  O ur si m ul a t i o ns suppor t  t hi s  a r gum e nt  Fi gure  4 sh ow s  225\260C 200\260C 275\260C 150\260C 150\260C 200\260C 225\260C 250\260C 250\260C 225\260C 275\260C 250\260C 200\260C 225\260C 250\260C 175\260C 200\260C 150\260C 275\260C 150\260C 175\260C 175\260C 275\260C 175\260C                                              Figure 2.

the hydrostatic stress gradient in the VIA for the Kelvin structure. The gradient is shown from the VIA center to the top of the M2-layer. Simulations were done at room temperature both for SiO 2 and our low-k material as IMD. Higher stress gradients are present in the VIA when using low-k materials making them more vulnerable to voiding in the VIA compared to SiO 2  In summary, M1-planes lead to void formation below a VIA requiring vacancy diffusion along the copper/cap interface, while M2-planes results in void formation in a VIA driven by vacancies that diffuse along the Cu/barrier interface It is well-known that the copper/cap interface is the preferred diffusion path [1  m a ki ng st r uc t u r e s w i t h M 1 pl a ne s m o re vulnerable to SIV compared to structures with M2-planes. Still due to higher stress gradients in the VIA when integrated in low-k materials, SIV in structures with M2-planes is found to be significant as well B  The steady increase of the drift as function of temperature in region II The steady increase of the drift in region II shown in figure 3 is more significant for structures with M2-planes compared to M1-plane structures Above 275\260C, oxidation of the barrier underneath the VIA has been reported for unpassivated samples h o xi d at i o n  leads to a resistance increase. On different wafers from the same process, we performed an electron energy-loss spectroscopy \(EELS\ analysis of the barrier underneath the VIA of samples stressed at 350\260C for 4 weeks. This analysis did not show a sign of oxidation \(figure 5\, so it can be excluded that the drift in region II is due to this mechanism Void formation in either of the two metal layers, which is not related to the presence of VIA\222s, can be another possible explanation for the drift increase as a function of temperature in region II. Figure 6 shows the percentage drift of the resistance of narrow M1- and M2-structures without the presence of VIA\222s annealed at temperatures between 150 and 275\260C for 16 days. Also, the percentage drift of the sheet resistance of wide M1- and M2-layers is depicted. No resistance increase is observed, making the upward shift in region II caused by the presence of VIA\222s We further investigated the mechanism behind the drift in region II by comparing the time dependence of the degradation processes present in regions I and II. Figure 7 shows the time dependence of the drift/VIA for the structures with M1- and M2-planes for selected temperatures in region I and II.

mechanisms are the cause of both failure mechanisms in regions I and II C  Two co-existing mechanisms operating on Region I and Region II For both structures with an M1- or M2-plane, there is no temperature with a drift of 0 Ohm per VIA \(figure 3\This supports the hypothesis that two diffusion mechanisms are active. The degradation mechanism dominant in region I has received more attention in literature and was linked to stress gradients [1  I f t h e d e grad a t i o n  m e c h a n i s m  do m i na nt  i n  region II would be driven by a stress gradient as well, one would expect a temperature with zero drift, i.e. at the true stress free temperature which is the temperature point where the copper turns from tensile to compressive stress. As a temperature with zero drift was not observed, the drift in region II cannot be due to a stress gradient alone Our FE simulations in figure 8 depict the hydrostatic stress in the copper in the VIA-region at different temperatures Around the stress free temperature T 0 the stress gradients are very small. This supports the argument that stress gradients cannot be the only driving force for the shifts we observe in region II.  We argue that the diffusion mechanism dominating in region II is driven by the vacancy gradients present in the VIA-region. The additional vacancies generated during the complex low-k trench patterning redistribute through the grains into the VIA, making the VIA resistance increase This also explains why this effect is more dominant in structures with M2-planes: M1 does have a vacancy gradient component, but we M2 patterning in our low-k materials is the main source of vacancies.  Hence, the mechanism is more apparent in the M2-plane structures, where there is a larger vacancy volume.  Voiding was not observed during failure                                                                        0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 012345 t 1/2 days 1/2  Drift/VIA \(Ohm M1-plane - 200\260C M2-plane - 200\260C M1-plane - 275\260C M2p lane - 275\260C  Figure 7.

The fit of this model to the data presented in figure 3 is shown in figure 9 for the structure with the M1-plane \(top\nd for the structure with the M2-plane \(bottom The activation energies in region I and II resulting from this fit are 0.9eV and 1.2eV, respectively. These values are in good agreement with literature values for interface and grain boundary diffusion [12 A l s o t h e f i t t e d v a l u es  of N   2  n d  T 0 225\260C\ are in good agreement with literature values [1   The obtained activation energies support our hypotheses that the degradation mechanism dominating in region I is due to interface diffusion \(section A\, while the diffusion processes causing the drifts in region II are driven by grain boundary diffusion \(section C The different peak locations for the M1- and M2-plane structures in region I are fitted well using our model. The peak is due to the interaction of the two co-existing mechanisms stress gradient driven- & vacancy gradient driven-vacancy diffusion\.  The peak occurs at different positions due to their interaction and can change position as one is more dominant in a given structure. Besides this, small differences in thermal treatments \(M1 undergoes post-plating anneal of M2\ and structural layouts \(such as height, presence of VIA,\205 between M1- and M2-layers can result in different stress- and vacancy gradients in these two layers resulting in different peak locations E  Kelvin structure Compared to the structure with the M1-plane, the drift/VIA of the Kelvin structure \(figure 3\ shows slower degradation in region I. The drift/VIA of this Kelvin is similar to the M2-plane structure in region II Based on our reasoning in section C, the behavior of the Kelvin structure in region II is to be expected: the drift in this region is due to vacancy movement in and above the VIAregion. For bigger M2-planes, more vacancies are present leading to faster drifts The slower drift in region I of the Kelvin compared to the structure with the M1-plane is however a bit surprising: one would expect the drift of the Kelvin to be driven by M1- and                                         0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 100 150 200 250 300 Temp \(\260C Drift/VIA \(Ohm 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Drift/VIA \(Ohm Diffusion-Creep model Arrhenius model Full model M1-plane M2-plane Region I 0.9eV Region II 1.2eV  Figure 9.

M2-plane effects, resulting in a faster drift than any of the other two structures. We argue that this is due to the symmetry of the structure \(figure 10\: the VIA in the Kelvin is both below and on top surrounded by big metal planes. This implies a stress on the VIA that is equal in all directions. This is different for the other two structures used in this study \(figure 1\: for these structures, the VIA\222s are, at one end, connected to a metal line This metal line is in tensile stress and pulls the VIA to a certain extend in one preferred direction. This leads to higher stresses on the VIA compared to a symmetrical Kelvin structure which than leads to higher stress gradients, resulting in faster degradation This idea is further supported by our FE simulations Figure 11 shows the hydrostatic gradient under a VIA for symmetrical and asymmetrical structures. The symmetrical structure shows significantly smaller stress gradients compared to the asymmetrical structure IV  C ONCLUSIONS  The early stages of the stress-induced-voiding mechanism below and in VIA\222s have been studied for interconnects integrated in a porous low-k material, using structures with M1- or M2-planes, respectively.  It was observed that below 225\260C, a peak was present for both voiding mechanisms. The voiding below the VIA was more pronounced, but the voiding in the VIA was significant as well. FEM showed  much higher stress gradients present in the VIA for our materials compared to SiO 2 based dielectrics. We attribute the significant voiding in the VIA to this gradient.  Above 225\260C, we found a significant increase of the drift that was more pronounced for the M2-plane structures. By observing the lack of a temperature at which no drift occurred and using FEM, we argued that stress gradients alone could not be responsible for this shift. We attributed this shift to a vacancy gradient present in the VIA We proposed an addition to the model of McPherson and Dunn [10  w he r e w e a d d a n A r r he ni us t e r m t o t he  d i ffusi oncreep model enabling the appropriate description of porous low-k integration schemes. We find a good match between the modified model and the data. A fitted activation energy of 0.9eV below 225\260C supports interface diffusion in this region while a fitted activation energy of 1.2eV supports the hypothesis of grain boundary diffusion in the temperature region above 225\260C. We believe that performing SIV in this region do not allow a true study of the SIV-effect and that tests at lower temperatures are required when qualifying processes with respect to SIV Additionally, it is argued that VIA\222s connected to the center of big metal plates above and below are less susceptible to SIV compared to VIA\222s connected to line ends. Higher stress gradients are present in VIA\222s asymmetrically connected to line ends making them more susceptible to SIV. We believe this need to be taken into account when qualifying processes with respect to SIV A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank the IST project  pullnano n o 026828 for financial support.

enterprises, the researchers do not however claim that the categories of IT adoption or of development outcomes are exhaustive. The applicability of the constructs is constrained by the sample size available and the inductive process used to evaluate the sample Despite this limitation, it is also important to note that the methodology used in this study is qualitative in nature and bottom up. In other words, the results and analysis is very strongly tied to the data and the conclusions have been derived bottom-up from the data. As per Straus e coding proces s us ed  in the study allows the researchers to apply their theoretical sensitivity to make sense of the data. Future focus groups may reveal other adoption categories. But as for the IT adoption categories discovered and developed in this current study, they are heavily rooted in the data and represent the actual context from which they were extracted   8. Conclusion  Micro-enterprises are crucial contributors to the economy, both in developed as well as in developing countries. Nonetheless, research has shown that they are often ill-adapted to the technological demands of the modern economy. In this study we used inductive reasoning, coding and classification to expand upon earlier research by Qureshi et al. [2 at pu t m i croentrepreneurs into technology attitude groups. We tied these attitude groups into a conceptual model of development outcome expectations, concluding that most of the entrepreneurs had limited and specific expectations concordant with their previous limited and specific technology exposure. Finally, we made some conjectures about the kinds of interventions that would be most suitable for these entrepreneurs. Future research will focus on testing and clarifying both the aforementioned technology attitude groups and the model tying the groups to specific outcome expectations. The hope is that a robust model will facilitate successful and sustained technology interventions in the future  9.
