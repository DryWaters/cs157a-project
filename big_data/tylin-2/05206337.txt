Long-term Performance Observation of a Free Space Optics Link  M. Löschnigg*, P. Mandl*, E. Leitgeb  Institute of Broadband Communication, TU Graz, Austria markus.loeschnigg@student.tugraz.at, peter.mandl@student.tugraz.at, erich.leitgeb@tugraz.at   Abstract New bandwidth demanding services for our data networks, especially the Internet, require higher data rates This ongoing certainty will be an issue accompanying the development of future networks and a certain focus will be 
kept on this in the next couple of decades. The already available high data rates in the backbone of the Internet have to be made accessible for the end-user. Free Space Optics \(FSO\ very fast and reliable endorsement to radio links using light to transmit data. Different FSOsystems have been developed at TU Graz in the past years ranging from cheap devices, built with components available on the mass market, to expert systems using components from space technology. Besides other 
influences, weather and in particular fog has a big impact on the reliability of a FSO link. One of these systems was used in a project to collect long-term performance data over a period of almost three years. This paper shows the results in terms of availability of the optical link used in the conducted project and the influence of fog I  I NTRODUCTION  In the last three decades the use of data networks has increased enormously. In the beginning the Internet mainly provided text-oriented services like websites or 
emailing, whereas nowadays multimedia services, like Internet Protocol Television \(IPTV\ or application service providing \(ASP\as come to the fore. All these modern services offered require higher data rates for the end customers. Optical networks are networks based on optical components providing high data rates and high capacities. Fibre-to-the-home delivers these high data rates to the consumer unfortunately fibre is not comprehensively available or the cabling costs are simply too high Free Space Optics \(FSO\ a wireless technology for 
the last mile access capable to overcome the lack of fibre cables. FSO systems can be operated in a point-to-point mode to interconnect two locations or in a point-tomultipoint mode. In the past years different types of FSO systems have been developed at TU Graz. To undermine the high availability of FSO links, very short term observations have been conducted. Availability in general defines the proportion of time a system is in full operational condition. It is usually expressed in percentage. In terms of FSO systems the availability gives the percentage of time a link is available for 
communication. The results of these observations have revealed that atmospheric disturbances, especially fog have an impact on the reliability of a FSO link Therefore a project was initiated in April 2006 to collect long-term data. In the municipality of Dobl, close to Graz, Austria, a deactivated antenna mast of a broadcast station is used by public institutions to collect weather data and is therefore equipped with a broadband Internet connection. Dobl was interested to interlink its elementary school close to the antenna mast with the broadcast station to provide an Internet connection for the students [2 T h e 
air-distance between the school building and the broadcast station is approximately 300 meters. Considering all these circumstances the location is ideal for measurements   Figure 1.Visualization of the project area with the FSO link  II  FSO  S YSTEMS   P ROJECT  A free space optics system \(FSO\ a very flexible broadband access solution providing high data rates without long cabling to access backbone networks. In 
comparison to other wireless access technologies \(e.g point-to-point radio systems\ a FSO system has outstanding advantages like higher bandwidth, better ability to concentrate beams, simpler assembling and disassembling, better beam bundling, no license fees for the usage of radio channels, better security against wiretapping. Disadvantages are atmospheric influences like rain, snow, fog and direct sun beams. Today FSO 


point-to-point links are used for the quick setup of low range inner city links, broadband links between motorways, rail tracks or rivers, for the wiretap-proof connection between company buildings and corresponding institutions and to connect mobile sanitary and other equipment of executive authorities, the fire brigade, and armed forces to a backbone network during crisis operations. For these reasons FSO is the optimal technology to operate within the numerated and many more cases A FSO system which offers a bidirectional point-topoint function consists of two separated optical sending and receiving units \(OSE\with integrated receiving and transmitting devices. The receiving part is realised with PIN diodes whereas the transmitting one is made up with LED or laser diodes The FSO devices used in the present \(Fig. 2\ject where built with components available on the mass market. The possible functional range of these devices is declared for a distance ranging from 30 m to 600 m with clear sky conditions. The recommended distance of operation is defined for an air-line of slightly less than 300 m    Figure 2. FSO system developed by TU Graz and used in the project mounted onto the antenna mast with a detailed front-view of the system in the right hand corner  The optical transmitter consists of eight high power LEDs operating at 850nm with a total transmission power of 28mW and a beam divergence of 42mrad \(2.5°\. This complies with Laser Class 1M \(IEC 60 825-1: 2001\The optical receiver is equipped with a Si-PIN diode with a sensitivity of 45µW/m 2 and an additional optical band pass filter. The data and management interfaces are realised with a fibre connection, the data transfer rate is given by 10Mbit/s with a protocol transparent Ethernet interface  To adjust the system, both OSE units are equipped with LED indicators and an analogue measurement instrument to display the received power One OSE device was mounted onto the antenna mast Fig. 2\he corresponding device onto a stable massive suspension arrangement outside a window of the school building. A clear line of sight is of course necessary and available between the locations \(Fig. 3\. Data collecting started in April 2006 and ended at the end of November 2008. All necessary power supplies were redundantly available not to lose data because of lack of power   Figure 3. Line of sight from the school building to the antenna mast III  A TMOSPHERIC I NFLUENCES  Short term observations of other installations have shown that atmospheric influences affect the reliability of a FSO link on Earth. Different influences, like rainfall snow, direct sunlight or fog cause diverse disturbances to the connection. FSO links used in space for inter-satellite communications are not confronted with this kind of atmospheric influences and are therefore not hindered by weather. Our atmosphere is divided into different layers with different characteristics. The Troposphere is the layer we live in and is also the layer where the entire weather pattern is happening. It is known from other investigations that dense fog can have the major impact on the reliability of a FSO link Everything falling down from the sky in terms of weather is referred to as atmospheric fallout. The continuous movement of water below, above and on the surface of the Earth is called hydrologic cycle. During this movement water changes from one aggregate state to another, always repeating the movement T h ere are  different processes during this movement, one of them is condensation. Condensation is responsible for producing clouds and fog through transformation of water vapour to liquid water droplets in the air. Fog is distinguished from clouds through the contact with the ground. Basically, fog is a cloud bank contacting the ground and causing the visibility to drop to a value less than 1000 m. Fog itself is again subdivided into many types, depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred    Figure 4. Fog covering the valley, seen from a mountain at 2000 m 


For the formation of fog it is fundamental for the water to condense upon something. This could be dust, aerosols or anything else like pollutants. So environmental pollution can have an effect on the forming of fog which indirectly affects the availability of an optical link It is also very important to understand that there is a difference between maritime and continental fog  the average dense fog in the project area the attenuation can be defined with up to 100 db/km. The state of fog is very stable for a long time, like an hour, not causing fast changes in the attenuation. Figure 5 shows typical results found in earlier investigations for the area of Graz  Figure 5. Specific attenuation for 850 & 950 nm at Graz   Dense maritime fog on the contrary is different and can be defined with up to 400 db/km. Fast changes are very common because of the sea-side winds moving the air-masses quickly \(Fig. 6\e results in figure 6 were collected in La Turbie, near Nice \(France\ng with the data show in figu   T h ere is als o a s i g n i f i cant  difference in the particle size. Particles of continental fog usually have a diameter of 4 µm whereas particles of maritime fog have an average size of 20 µm ll i n all  the assumption can be made that the availability of a FSO link will mainly depend on the geographic location Different locations on Earth will bear different availability data for FSO links  Figure 6. Specific attenuation for 550 nm and 850 & 950 nm near Nice   IV  M EASUREMENT   D ATA C OLLECTION  Data about the availability of the link was gathered through permanently sending small Internet Protocol packets from one end and requiring the receiving side to reply to the sent packet. The measurements were conducted under real life conditions. The whole network of the school with about twenty personal computers was connected to the Internet using the broadband connection in the broadcast station accessed through the FSO link The broadband connection is limited to 4 Mbit/s, so even under full load the optical crosslink still provides sufficient resources to handle the measurement packets At both locations dedicated servers for collecting data were installed and used to initiate traffic over the optical wireless connection every 10 ms. The results of the measurements were stored into a remotely accessible database. Additionally every full hour a regular file download via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(http\was initiated over the FSO link to protocol the data rate. The size of the transferred file was exactly 200 megabytes. A high layer protocol was chosen to fulfil the requirements of a real life test As stated before visibility drops enormously when fog comes into play. The project area is very close to an airport and so Austro Control, the official agency overseeing the Austrian Airspace, is also collecting visibility data for the area around the antenna mast. As fog is very stable in that area visibility is only measured once an hour, giving twenty four values a day.  Having two different sources of data made it necessary to correlate this information V  R ESULTS AND I NTERPRETATION  The already available statistic data from Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Austria concerning the project area shows that there are approximately 140 days of fog every year, usually in the period between October and March. So we expect mainly failures in the optical wireless connection during the winter months. The availability for the present link is shown for every single year in the following diagram based on the raw data. The raw data reflects the correlated values from the sources without considering known breakdowns of the system     Figure 7. Availability of the FSO link from 4/2006 to 11/2008 per year 


In the year 2006 the overall availability based on the raw data is 94.79%, which is still a high value but low compared to the other two years. During December 2006 there was a scheduled renovation work going on for seven days demanding to shutdown the optical link Excluding the collected values during the intended shutdown gives the real availability \(Fig. 8    Figure 8. Availability of the FSO link from 4/2006 to 11/2008 per year with corrected data of intended shutdowns  The availability of the link calculated with the corrected values increases to 97.35% which is very close to the values of the years 2007 and 2008. This allows the conclusion that the yearly cyclic weather pattern over the observation period behaved stable. Averaging the data of the almost three years gives the total availability of the FSO link for the present project \(Fig. 9    Figure 9. Average yearly FSO link availability based on the corrected data from 4/2006 until 11/2008  The average availability of 97.80% is a very good result for an optical wireless communication path. In comparison to a wired connection with availability of around or even more than 99.99% the investigated value seems to be low. Assuming a non leap year with 365 days gives a break-down time of the FSO link for slightly greater than 8 days \(8.03 d\ FSO links deliver a very high performance in terms of speed but the case study shows a downtime of eight days. So further projects should be conducted to couple FSO links with other wireless links to enhance the overall availability However, the question arises, taking all available data into account, if the assumption is correct and the FSO link mainly fails in the winter months from October to March due to the worse weather conditions compared to the summer months. Again, it has to be stated that this is only true for the project area. In the area of Graz, Austria dense fog mainly appears in the colder months due to low temperature. Fog is usually produced when the difference between temperature and dew point is less than 2.5 degrees Celsius    Figure 10. Average FSO link availability  a comparison of winter and summer months from 4/2006 until 11/2008  Figure 10 clearly shows the correctness of the assumption made prior. During the summer months the availability is exceptionally high whereas in the winter months the percentage of 95.61% reduces the overall performance to 97.80%. As we know that fog in the project area mainly occurs in the winter time we need to find a relation between the breakdown of the link and the decrease of the visibility caused by atmospheric influences. Only the winter months are of interest because no breakdowns occurred during the summer months. Due to the fact that the huge amount of data points cannot all be show in one diagram, a representative day was chosen    Figure 11. Availability of the FSO link and corresponding visibility on the 26 th of December 2006  Figure 11 shows the availability in an hourly resolution in blue colour and its ordinate is on the left hand side whereas the visibility has its ordinate on the right hand side and is shown in red colour. Values of the visibility higher than 350 m have been scaled to 350 m to fit into the diagram nicely. The documented maximum value of the visibility on the 26 th of December is 20 km. Any visibility value greater than 350 m has no importance for 


this setup. Analyzing all the available data reveals that the availability of the FSO link and the corresponding visibility relate to each other in a simple way. For the used FSO systems in the present project a threshold can be set. As soon as the visibility drops to a value less than 200 m the optical link is heavily disturbed by atmospheric influences and the crosslink dies. The components used to build the devices were chosen to overcome distances of up to 600 m with perfectly clear sky conditions and of about 300 m with light atmospheric disturbances However, dense fog definitely is a massive atmospheric influence and has therefore an impact on the availability of this very FSO link In contrary to radio communication in Free Space Optics the data rate does not drop to a smaller value under atmospheric influence. The optical link is either operational with the high data rate promised or completely lacks service. This is a great difference to other wireless technologies like Wireless Local Area Network \(WLAN\r satellite communication. The reason for this can be found in the way of communication. The pin photo diode at the receivi ng end tries to detect the incoming data from the sending site. Either the detection is successful, meaning sufficient information made its way into the receiving end with the full available data rate or the detection fails causing the communication to break down completely. The observations made during this project also undermine the very binary operation mode of FSO links. If a significant amount of photons can be detected by the photo diode then the full data rate is available. On the contrary if the threshold of detection is undercut no communication whatsoever is possible Deep analysis of the daily data and confirms this performance Furthermore not only the availability of the link is very high, also the devices themselves obviously provide great service over a long period of time. The initial installation of the FSO link including mounting the devices alignment of the systems and testing the connection, took one and an half hours. Since then no maintenance work had to be accomplished VI  C ONCLUSION  Free Space Optics is an excellent wireless communication technology, especially as last mile access and nomadic use technology [9 T h e in s t allat i on proces s  is very easy and quick, the high data rates available are definitive a great advantage. This field study has shown that a standalone FSO link can provide a very reliable connection with a total availability of 97.80% over thirty two months. In any case FSO systems should not be seen in competition with WLAN or other radio technologies it should rather be seen as a widening to the wireless world Future work should concentrate on increasing the availability and reliability of FSO links Current researches at TU Graz deal with a topic called switch-over. Links based on microwaves and FSO connections are differently influenced by atmospheric incidents. Microwave links are mainly disturbed by rain whereas FSO connections principally interfere with dense fog. The switch-over technology tries to combine both existing technologies to increase the overall reliability [4  of a link. Basically a FSO link is used for communication to provide a high data rate. However, parallel to the FSO connection a microwave link is installed to function as a backup channel. Whenever the atmospheric disturbances are too heavy for the optical link to work, a switch-over to the fallback microwave link is issued. As soon as the optical link comes available again the communication channel switches back to the more powerful FSO link in terms of data rates. The combined system is often called hybrid system d a real  f a s t s w i t cho v e r is  v ita l f o r it to work Another idea to increase the availability could be a change in the setup of the receiver side. In a very new approach someone could try to use greater areas like house walls as a receiver. The walls need to be coated with a special material collecting the information Finally, the collected data by the successfully conducted project has undermined the importance of fog for the FSO technology once more. The long-term observation of this link has shown that the availability of the optical connection in the summer months is better than in the winter months in the latitudes of Austria A CKNOWLEDGMENT  Regarding the excellent outcome of results the research group for Optical Communications \(OptiKom\TU Graz thanks all their cooperation partners for their support mainly the national cooperation partner Telekom Austria AG, the government of Styria, ML11  EDVDienstleistungen GmbH and the international cooperation partners within COST 270, SatNEx and COST 291 R EFERENCES  1 L e itg e b E., Br e g e n z e r J., F a sse r P G e bhar t M  Free Space Optics Extension to Fiber-Networks for the Last Mile Proceedings and Presentation at IEEE / LEOS 2002 Annual Meeting, 10 th 14 th  of November 2002, Glasgow, Scotland  2  L e i t g e b E  S h e i kh Muham m ad S Ch lesti l Ch G e bha r t M  Birnbacher U Reliability of FSO Links in Next Generation Optical Networks Proceedings and Invited Presentation at the IEEEconference ICTON 2005, 3 rd 7 th of Juliy2005, Barcelona  3 L e itg e b E G e bhar t  M B i r n ba che r U S c hr o tte r P   Me r d o n ig  A  Truppe A Hybrid wireless networks for civil-militarycooperation \(CIMIC\ and disaster management Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE's European Symposium on Optics and Photonics for Defence and Security, Vol. 5614, pp. 139-150, 25 th  28 th October 2004, London  4 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M  Bir n b a c h e r U K o gle r W S c hr o t te r P    High availability of hybrid wireless networks Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE's International Symposium Photonics Europe Vol. 5465, pp. 238-249, 26 th 30 th April 2004, Straßburg  5 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M  Bir n b a c h e r U  Optical Networks, Last Mile Access and Applications Book-Chapter of Free-Space Laser Communications: Principles and Advances, \(accepted 2004 published 2008\, Springer Verlag, ISBN: 978-0-387-28652-5  6 L e itg e b E., G e bhar t  M F a sse r P   Br e g e n z e r J., T a n c z o s J., I m pact of atmospheric effects in Free Space Optics transmission systems Proceedings and Presentation at SPIE Photonics West, LASE 2003, 25 th 31 st of January 2003, San Jose, CA, USA

6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
