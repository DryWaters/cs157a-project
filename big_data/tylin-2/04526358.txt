such as amplitude-to-amplitude modulation and amplitude-to-phase modulation models These models are based on single-tone measurements and do not accurately predict the amplifier performance for wider bandwidth modulations This paper presents measured comparisons of single-tone characteristics and spectrally-confined waveform performance in solid-state amplifiers at millimeter-wave frequencies Measurements are performed over a range of data rates with PSK and QAM modulations with comparison of devices with and without nonlinear memory TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 TESTING METHOD 2 3 COMPRESSION CHARACTERISTICS 2

these cases planning is done based on simulated or measured single-tone data This data is incomplete when trying to determine the maximum achievable power out of an amplifier with a waveform The primary application of this work focuses on small mobile terminals that have limited size weight and power For these terminals it is important to understand the maximum linear power that may be achieved from an amplifier since the maximum data rate for a terminal is primary limited by the transmitter power For non-constant modulus waveforms the traditional behavioral model is 
based on single-tone measurements and used for predicting the growth of spectrum outside the user channel which may cause adjacent channel interference ACI as well as in-channel distortion that would lead to an increase in error-vector magnitude EVM 1 This model assumes amplitude dependent amplitude AM-AM and amplitude dependent phase AM-PM changes measured at a single frequency as constant across the band These memory-less non-linear models MNLM are typically adequate for narrow bandwidth modulations however they do not consider the linear memory resulting from frequency 
dependent amplitude and phase variation as well as nonlinear memory often caused by bias circuits and thermal changes 2 This paper shows that without careful accounting of these distortions the maximum linear power of an amplifier may be significantly different than predicted by MNLM Presented in this work are sets of model and waveform measurements that highlight different non-linear phenomenon occurring in solid-state Q-band 43.5 GHz to 45.5 GHz amplifiers with non-constant modulus waveforms The measurements are performed using binary phase-shift keying BPSK 
and 12-4 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM constellations with root-raised cosine filter 3 The objectives are to estimate the maximum linear power expected from an amplifier for planning purposes and give an example of how design choices based on singletone measurements can result in a reduction in linear power The study is divided into two segments The first segment shows how the compression characteristics of the amplifier differ between single-tone and waveform measurements The second shows the differences in spectral re-growth 1 


l IT;z between amplifiers with and without strong memory effects and the shortcomings of using memory-less models such as AM-AM and AM-PM to predict the ACI 2 TESTING METHOD The Lincoln Laboratory amplifier testbed LLAT is a measurement platform developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to quantify the effects of solid-state power amplifiers SSPAs and traveling-wave tube amplifiers TWTAs on spectrally confined waveforms specifically ACI and EVM LLAT is capable of measuring amplifiers above 30 GHz with saturated output powers ranging from a few Watts to hundreds of Watts and waveforms with up to 100 MHz of bandwidth LLAT uses virtual modems running on a multi-processor grid to allow maximum flexibility in modem design LLAT is also capable of single-tone and multi-tone characterizations of the device for system identification of non-linear models with memory 4 During an experiment LLAT captures the amplifier input and output RF power DC input power spectrum EVM symbol error rate SER and bit error rate BER An Agilent HP8566B spectrum analyzer captures the spectrum of the amplifier output With no amplifier in the LLAT the spectrum analyzer noise limits the dynamic range to 60 dB at the frequency spans required for 3.75 mega symbols per second Msym/s and 52 dB at spans required at 15 Msym/s For the SSPAs presented in this study LLAT operates at a center frequency of 44.6 GHz SSPA A Power Compression u 2 t _I u z C C 4 6 8 BP 12 BP 12-14 12 Si 16L 5 SK 3.75Msym/s SK 15Msym/s 4 QAM 3.75Msym/s 4 QAM 15Msym/s igle Tone 0 5 10 15 20 Pin dBm Figure 1 Power compression characteristics of SSPA A which has little memory effect SSPA B Power Compression U 2 1-1 4 P 6  8 It 10  12 r 14  160BPSK 3.75MsymIs BPSK 15Msym/s 12-4 QAM 3.75MVsym/s 12-4 QAM 15MsymIsSigle Tone 5 10 Pin dBm 15 20 3 COMPRESSION CHARACTERISTICS Power compression curves of power amplifiers characterize the AM-AM distortion of the device and are measured using a single tone input power sweep while monitoring output power These measurements identify the linear region of operation and maximum saturated power Saturated power is the starting point for calculating the maximum effective isotropic radiated power EIRP for a transmitting platform This paper presents two example SSPAs The first is a device that displays very little memory and the second is a device with strong memory Both SSPAs are multi-stage gallium arsenide GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors pHEMT Output powers are normalized to the 1-dB gain compression point P1dB Both amplifiers are measured with a single tone and four waveforms consisting of combinations of BPSK and 12-4 QAM constellations at 3.75 Msym/s and 15 Msym/s Figure 2 Power compression characteristics of SSPA B which has gain expansion and strong memory effects SSPA A has minimal memory Figure 1 shows the compression characteristics of SSPA A This device has constant gain until it approaches saturation at which point it has slight gain expansion before rolling off to its saturated output power which is a good approximation of a ideal power limited amplifier When excited by the waveforms the output power follows the same trajectory as the singletone excitation in the linear region of the amplifier However as the amplifier approaches saturation the waveform excitation rolls off faster than the single tone The difference increases up to saturation where the waveform excitations have 1 dB less output power than the single tone curve SSPA B has larger memory and gain expansion than SSPA A shown in Figure 2 The waveform excitations follow a less pronounced gain-expansion trajectory but exhibit spreading between the two constellations and data rates as the amplifier approaches saturation In this device the waveform excitations are also 1 dB lower than the single tone curve and have 0.25 dB of spreading between the data 2 


rates The reduction in gain for the modulated signals is believed to be a result of the memory induced by a feedback in the bias network and was corrected in a later design Due to power limitations in the testbed at the time LLAT was unable to drive this amplifier fully into saturation 4 SPECTRAL RE-GROWTH As an amplifier approaches its saturated power level outof-band power in the adjacent channels increases The characteristics of the device determine the magnitude and symmetry of the adjacent channel power and the characteristics of the modulation scheme determine the spectral shape For most SATCOM systems an ACI mask is defined to prevent users from interfering with each other This mask defines how linear the amplifiers must be in order to operate with the system and is usually the dominate requirement that limits the maximum linear output power of the amplifier Therefore the linear EIRP for the terminal is the saturated EIRP presented in section 3 reduced by a factor that accounts for the loss of power when operating with a waveform of non-constant modulus This factor depends on the waveform and the amplifier These effects are shown in three cases an ideal power-limited amplifier memory-less non-linear models of both SSPAs and measured performance of the SSPAs on LLAT The results are normalized to the 1-dB compression point P1dB and indexed by output back-off OBO OBO is traditionally defined for single-tone measurements but not for waveforms This work defines OBO such that the average input power of a waveform has an equal average input power as single tone at the same OBO Though this is a working definition it is also useful for system level analysis which assumes that the amplifier operates similarly for single tones and waveforms in terms of power This assumption is a good approximation for certain regions of operation as shown in Section 3 The peak-to-average power ratio PAPR of the waveforms is estimated from the sampled baseband modulation generated using sixteen samples per symbol For BPSK the PAPR based on the maximum power sample is 4.23 dB however this maximum power sample is an unlikely statistical event 9900 of the time the waveform has an instantaneous PAPR IPAPR99 of 3.77 dB or less and a ratio of 3.12 dB or less 95 00 of the time These numbers are less than the absolute PAPR and give a better impression on how often the amplifier is driven to peak power The 12-4 QAM waveform has PAPR of 4.98 dB with IPAPR99 of 3.75 dB and IPAPR95 of 3.00 dB These numbers are very similar to the BPSK modulation showing the strong effect the pulse shaping filter has on the waveform envelope L 0 0.5 1 1.5 freq Symbols 2 Figure 3 An ideal power-limited amplifier with BPSK modulation A 3 dB OBO is required to meet at 30 dBc spectral mask on the first lobe 10 r 10 20 P 30 40 50 60 _ o Ideal Amplifier 12-4QAM OBO=O OBO=1 OBO=2 OBO=3 OBO=4 OBO=5 OBO=6 OBO=7 OBO=8 OBO=9 OBO=10 OBO 15 2 0.5 1 1.5 freq Symbols Figure 4 An ideal power-limited amplifier with 12-4 QAM modulation A 3 dB OBO is required to meet a 30 dBc spectral mask on the first lobe To form an upper bound estimate for the expectations of an amplifier simulations were performed on an ideal powerlimited amplifier An ideal power-limited amplifier has constant gain until reaching saturation at which point the output power is constant This amplifier has no AM-PM distortion or memory effects Shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 both BPSK and 12-4 QAM waveforms show no spectral re-growth for OBOs greater than 3 dB At these OBOs the peak amplitudes of the waveforms do not interact with the knee of the compression curve However spectral regrowth increases rapidly for OBOs 3 dB or less For comparison purposes an ACI mask of 30 dBc for the first lobe determines the minimum OBO that satisfies the linear power requirement 3 10 Ideal Amplifier BPSK o 0 10 20 P 30 40 OBO=0 OBO=1 OBO=2 OBO=3 OBO=4 OBO=5 OBO=6 OBO=7 OBO=8 OBO=9 OBO=10 OBO 15 50 60

In the ideal amplifier case both the BPSK and 12-4 QAM meet the ACI mask with OBO=3 dB The hump in the BPSK lobe is the result of it being statistically more likely to have a zero-crossing in BPSK modulation than 12-4 QAM In addition an OBO of 3 dB is similar to IPAPR95 implying that IPAPR95 may be a reasonable offset factor between linear and saturated EIRP The second case of study is simulation of memory-less nonlinear models such as AM-AM and AM-PM The manufacturers provided large-signal measurement-based AM-AM and AM-PM models of SSPAs A and B to simulate using the LLAT software The spectral re-growth of these models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a shows the onset of spectral re-growth much earlier than the ideal amplifier case Since SSPAs A and B have different AM-AM characteristics shown as power compression curves in Figure 1 and Figure 2 the re-growth characteristics are also different between the two models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a for SSPA A and Figure 7\(a and Figure 8\(a for SSPA B Although the memory-less non-linear models show larger re-growth than the ideal amplifier model for both BPSK and 12-4 QAM they provide an optimistic expectation of only a few dB OBO requirement for most spectral masks The third case of study is a measurement of the two SSPA devices using LLAT Each device is characterized using BPSK and 12-4 QAM waveforms at 3.75 and 15 Msps In the case of SSPA A the device without significant memory effects BPSK modulation at the two data rates shown in Figure 5\(b and Figure 5\(c match closely with the model simulation in Figure 5\(a A degradation of a few dB in spectral re-growth is observed when comparing the measured data and the model The measurements also match closely with the model for 12-4 QAM shown in Figure 6\(b and Figure 6\(c 5 CONCLUSION During the early planning and design phase of a SATCOM terminal it is important to predict the expected radiated power from a transmitting amplifier This is especially true for small mobile terminals where size weight and power are at a premium Under these conditions the transmitting amplifiers must be optimized for power efficiency and linearity Understanding how the non-linear effects of an amplifier distort a waveform is a difficult task especially when limited to single-tone data Simulations show that a few dB of OBO is required to meet an ACI mask of 30 dBc even with in an ideal power-limited amplifier IPAPR95 of a waveform is a reasonable estimate for required OBO Measurements indicate that it is possible to realize Q-band solid-state amplifiers that approximate an ideal power-limited amplifier however care must be taken not to add memory into the device when optimizing it for high-power and high-efficiency performance Future work will investigate the limitations of two-tone measurements in predicting distortion since two-tone waveforms have a limited PAPR 5 LLAT is capable of fully interrogating an amplifier in order to develop highfidelity behavioral models 6 7 Ongoing work aims to understand how millimeter-wave solid-state and travelingwave tube amplifier distortions relate to ACI EVM and BER as data rate increases However SSPA B which has strong memory presents two effects The first is degradation in spectral re-growth in the first side-band region of 5 to 10 dB for the lower data rate shown in Figure 7\(b for BPSK and Figure 8\(b for 12-4 QAM The higher data rate has 10 to 15 dB degradation in the first side band shown in Figure 7\(c and Figure 8\(c The second effect is the asymmetry in the re-growth between the highand low-side bands The memory-less non-linear model based on single-tone measurements of SSPA B does not make any predictions of side-band asymmetry The strong memory in SSPA B was determined to be the result of bias circuitry originally designed for maximum power and efficiency using single-tone measurements Modifications to the bias network improved the performance and significantly reduced the memory effects 6

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
