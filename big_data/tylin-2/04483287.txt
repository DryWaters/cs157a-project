Following a different approach da Silva and Craizer 7 s h o w ed that successive approximation of vectors under certain conditions is guara nteed to converge in a 002nite amount of time Formally a vector v is said to be successively approximated by a sequence of codewords u l if the summation v  1 X l 0 013 l u l  3 u l 2 C  f c 0  c 1   c K g converges where C is the codebook c k are the codewords and 013 is a scaling factor to account for the fact that after each interaction the residua l error is bound by a smaller N dimensional hypersphere For every codebook and codewor d dimension there is a choice often empiric of 013 that proves to be optimal i.e that provides the best representation results Since in lossy coding we are interested only in obtaining a cl ose enough approximation of the original data that is with a limited amount of error a 002nite summation is used instead of the in\002nite one resulting in v L  L X l 0 013 l u l  4 In the proposed vector version of the SPECK algorithm the abo ve approximation is done by choosing at each encoding pass the one codeword tha t best represents the residual error between the original data and its current rec onstructed version For the experiments reported herein the codebooks were de\002ned base d on the 1 s t and 2 n d shells of the D 4 lattice with the codewords being properly normalized to un it length Henceforth we will refer to those codebooks as D 4 shell-1 and D 4 shell-2 III LVQ-SPECK The proposed encoding method is based on the SPECK algorithm  4  a n d c o n s i s t s o f a vector extension of its principles to account for the need to work with multi-dimensional samples We will now present a description of the algorithm pointing out the main differences between the vector and scalar case For more det ails about the original scalar method the reader is referred to 4  LVQ-SPECK applies a DWT to each of the scalar bands generating a group of adjacent data sets containing transform coef\002cients We de\002ne a Group Of Images GOI as this set of adjacent transformed spectral bands b i being encoded Figure 1 shows how a vector sample v  x y  is de\002ned for a given GOI of dimension 4 Hence for each spati al coordinate we have v  x y    b n  x y   b n 1  x y   b n 2  x y   b n 3  x y   5 where each component belongs to a distinct spectral band Si nce we are now dealing with vector quantities the signi\002cance measure used will b e de\002ned by comparing the vector's norm against the current encoding threshold T n  that is 000 n  T    1  if max x  y 2T k v x  y k\025 T n 0  otherwise  6

reproduction distortion It is also worth noticing that as in the original scalar SPECK codec the generated bit stream is still an embedded one Comparison with 3D transform coding As discussed in 8  t h e p e r f o r m a n c e o f a n i m a g e c o m p r e s s i o n algorithm based on successive approximation of vectors is not only dependent o n how well distributed in space the codewords are but also on how well-matched those a re to the source ndimensional statistics in terms of correlation For each vector to be quantized the better the 002rst approxim ation step the least amount of residue will remain and therefore a smaller number of re\002n ing steps will be needed resulting in better overall performance As such in the pre sent case it is of paramount importance that the quantizer used during the sorting pass p ossesses characteristics that are similar to those of the source being compressed During t he remaining re\002nement steps this requirement becomes less stringent since the re sidue's statistics tend to be more uniformly distributed over the n-dimensional space m aking the packing properties of the lattice more important When one applies a unitary transform A across the spectral dimension thereby inducing an orthonormal basis rotation there generally is a reducti on in the correlation among the components of the source vectors but the euclidean distanc es are maintained due to the norm preserving property Therefore as far as the 002rst appr oximation pass is concerned matching the transformed by A  source vectors to a codebook is equivalent to matching the original source vectors to an appropriately transforme d by A 003 T  codebook In subsequent passes since the residuals tend to have orien tations evenly distributed over an hypersphere what matters is just the relative orien tation of the vectors in the codebooks 8  a n d t h e r e f o r e a l l c o d e b o o k r o t a t i o n s h a v e e q uivalent performance from the second pass on This implies that the codebook of choice s hould be the one whose vectors best match the spectral features of the source In th e next section we validate the above assumption by comparing the performance of LVQ-SP ECK with and without a transform a 4-point DCT in the spectral dimension using di fferent rotated versions of a codebook IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The LVQ-SPECK algorithm was used to compress scenes of the AVI RIS hyperspectral images Moffet Field and Jasper Ridge obtained from http aviris.jpl.nasa.gov both cropped to 512 002 512 002 224 A pre-processing step was added to remove all the zero-e nergy spectral bands from the hyperspectral block with the indic es of those bands being sent as negligible overhead The spectral bands were then groupe d into 4-dimensional blocks to be encoded The DWT kernel used was the 9/7 wavelet 10  a n d a 5 s t a g e t r a n sform was applied to each spectral band Bit allocation across sub-bands is don e implicitly based on the signi\002cance of each vector being encoded Each signi\002cance test accounts for one bit in the 002nal bit-stream and since both 4-dimensional codebook s used contain 24 vectors in the worst case vector index transmission will demand log 2 24  4  59 bits during the sorting pass and log 2 25  4  64 bits during the re\002nement ones to account for the zero codeword

4 in our case It also shows that in the early phases of the app roximation process LVQSPECK does a better job of representing the transformed data As encoding rates go up however 3D-based codecs generally present better resu lts given the high degree of energy compaction provided by the additional transform On e possible way of improving the performance of LVQ-SPECK would be to process a larger numb er of adjacent spectral bands together and use higher dimensional lattices with be tter packing properties such as the 003 24 lattice 12  T h a t i s q u i t e i m p o r t a n t  s i n c e d u r i n g t h e r e 002 n ement steps the residues to be encoded are of a highly uncorrelated nature a s discussed in Section III It is also clear from Table I that simultaneously encoding a g roup of spectral bands using LVQ-SPECK provides much better results than the indivi dual compression of each one of them For instance for a rate of 1.0 bpp there is an app roximate gain of 10dB in SNR for all the images tested It is worth mentioning that for all studied images the codebook based on the D4 shell-2 lattice was the one that prov ided the best performance However we may also say based on the presented results tha t the chosen rotation of the lattice codebook was suitable for the Moffet image but p erhaps not so suitable for Jasper which shows us that this method is quite promising p rovided one uses the proper lattice rotation Figure 3 presents a visual comparison between the original d ata and a reconstructed version at 0.2 bpppb for spectral band 48 of the Moffet Field image Scene 03 with the points from D 4 shell-2 lattice serving as codebook V C ONCLUSIONS We presented a new multidimensional image codec based on the SPECK state-ofthe-art algorithm that makes use of a lattice vector quanti zer codebook suited to the encoding of hyperspectral images We showed that the propos ed algorithm using a 2D DWT kernel applied independently to each spectral band atta ins performance comparable to those methods that employ a 3D transform and clearly outpe rforms the alternative of separately encoding each spectral band Moreover for lo w bit rates LVQ-SPECK produces reproduction results that are in some cases over whelmingly better than those of 3D encoding methods The importance of choosing the right codebook was discussed by comparing equivalent codebooks where one is a rotated version of the other It was veri\002ed that the version of the codebook which more closely matches the source characte ristics over the sorting pass is the one yielding best performance results This properly rotated codebook produced performance comparable to 3D wavelet coders Further improvements are expected with the simultaneous en coding of a larger number of spectral bands and the use of higher-dimensional lattice s e.g E 8  003 16 and 003 24  as the basis for the codebook and methods of fast computation to de termine the best rotation angle to de\002ne the codebook

  13  Use of Web Technologies The web development effort involved a long learning curve for some of the RDE Upgrade development team HTML We used HyperText Markup Language \(HTML\o layout the web framework and page structures AJAX/JSON  The AJAX \(asynchronous JavaScri pt and XML\tern was introduced to support a responsive web GUI.  An implementation of JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation provides the data service inte rface from the web client to a tomcat-maintained servlet. We have run into very few issues with this technology 10 11 12  CSS Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\provide a straightforward way to manage web page styles. The language is well supported through the open-source FireBug Edito 14  JavaScript We used JavaScript to provide a rich interactive web interface, however our experien ce with JavaScript was not entirely favorable.   The Java Script \(JS approach to APIs including widgets led to our implementing more JS code than we might otherwise have.  We found the 223typeless\224 language occasionally caused confusion.  We did find that it could be \223made to provide\224 a rich web interface though probably a heavier interface than it needs to be.  One real positive for JS is the huge volume of sample code available on the Internet, saving time when dealing with the many implementation problems that spring up JasperReport  We used a toolkit called JasperReport to build a database report we could execute from our web interface.  A JasperReport is edited using the iReport tool. When the report is opened, the JasperSoft library is executed which updates each field from the database and presents the updated report The next section describes some of the \223analysis views\224 that can be generated from data in the RDE store 5  R ELAY A CCOUNTABILITY A NALYSIS  From the start of the Phoenix mission through the current day the RDE tool has been us ed primarily to extract pass statistics for reporting.  The key primary tracked statistic is the total volume of data delivered by each relay spacecraft Typically the \223Export Volumes\224 web view is used for a 223quick\224 export of these data, though the \223General Query\224 view can also be used for this purpose.  Raw tabular data are exported in Comma Separated Value \(CSV\at and then normally imported into an Excel spreadsheet for charting Figure 6 shows the total volume over time from the start of Phoenix mission \(Sol 0\o Sol 120, about a month past the end of prime mission Cumulative Return Link Data Volume 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 0 30 60 90 120 Sol MRO Cumulative Ret Fill DV MRO Cumulative Ret PHX DV ODY Cumulative Ret Fill DV ODY Cumulative Ret PHX DV   Figure 6 \226 Cumulative Return Link Volume Figure 7 shows the same data values, but charted to show the total data volume transmitted per Sol  Return Link Data Volume by Sol PHX Lander Data + Fill Data 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 30 60 90 120 Sol ODY Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits MRO Ret Data Volume \(PHX Data + Fill bits  Figure 7 \226 Data Volume By Sol  On Figure 6 and Figure 7, the Phoenix Data Volume \(DV shown represents actual telemetry data and science product delivered.  The Fill DV on both figures represents \223fill\224 frames that are transmitted when a relay link is open but no actual lander data is available to transmit.  This chart shows that the Odyssey mission has carried the most part of 


  14 Phoenix relay data over MRO.  The low MRO volumes at the very early end of the chart are due to early MRO communications issues with Phoenix that were not resolved until later in the mission.  The volume discrepancies are clearly visible from both charts Figure 8 shows the data volumes for the 128K overflights as a function of Mars LMST \(Local Mean Solar Time 128 kbps Return Link Data Rate 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0:00:00 6:00:00 12:00:00 18:00:00 0:00:00 Local Mean Solar Time ODY MRO PHX Re q uirement:  30 Mb p ass  Figure 8 \226 Data Volume By Sol  Figure 9 shows a comparison of data volume predicts vs pass performance values  Figure 9 \226 Volume Predicts vs. Performance  6  C ONCLUSIONS  For ASC, the next step is to achieve a level of database independence.  We look to take advantage of emerging best practices technologies and patterns \(e.g. Hibernate  t o  upgrade our core server function to database independence and our Agent Framework to take advantage of a workflow execution function or language such as the Business Process execution Language \(BPEL  RDE is planned for update with the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\ission.  This will include any required updates to the planning input s \(MSL will utilize a wider range of relay parameters, including higher data rates multiple frequency channels and possibly new modulation and coding schemes and adaptive data rate functionality and a likely major change in the handling of predicts One significant additional RDE improvement proposed is to develop a web-based tactical interface supporting pass utilization requests and tacti cal updates.  Currently, all tactical relay coordination is accomplished via email and phone.  This process could be greatly improved with the upgrade to of a web-based system.  However, if adopted this upgrade would have a large impact on the current operational tactical process and thus must be carefully engineered across a broad user base  Overall we found we were able to accomplish our primary relay accountability goals using our chosen architecture The ASC server held up as a useful way to manage objectrelational transactions over a distributed network, and our event-driven client mechan isms were assembled in a straightforward manner using the existing ASC Agent Framework as well as the DOM message reactor function Our ability to accomplish this broad integration at a consistently low level of funding tells us that these technologies and patterns are worth pursuing as part of further accountability prototype pilot, and deployment activities A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  The work described in this paper was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Californi a Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The authors wish to further acknowledge other individuals who made key contributions to research and development including Marti DeMore, Lloyd DeForrest, Derek Kiang Ashley Shamilian, Lori Nakamura, Mark Palm, Priscilla Parrish and Mike Tankenson
