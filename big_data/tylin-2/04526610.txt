Automated Health Management for Gas Turbine Engine Accessory System Components Carl S Byington Matthew J Watson Sudarshan P Bharadwaj Impact Technologies LLC 2571 Park Center Blvd Suite 1 State College PA 16801 814-861-6273 Carl.Byington impact-tek.com Abstract-Traditional engine health management development has focused on major gas turbine engine turbomachinery components such as disks blades and main bearings because these components are expensive to maintain and their failures frequently have safety implications However 
the majority of the events that compromise mission success and equipment availability in military aircraft arise from the degradation or failures of engine accessory system components such as valves pumps and actuators Failure or statistical-based maintenance of these components fails to account for unanticipated and extreme operating scenarios which are a major cause of unscheduled maintenance events U.S military systems are thus moving toward condition-based maintenance CBM wherein maintenance is performed as 
and when required thus improving asset availability and contributing significantly to mission success.1 2 The authors have developed low-overhead diagnostics and prognostics techniques which would enable a shift toward CBM of engine accessory components The current work focused on aircraft fuel and lubrication systems Modelbased and data-driven techniques were developed to provide reliable health assessments of hydraulic pumps and valves which are essential components on these systems TABLE OF

to be balanced with total operating cost using a risk-based decision making process Such algorithms would find ready application on board the current fleet of military aircraft as well as on emerging platforms such as the F-35 Lightning II a.k.a Joint Strike Fighter Not only does the current work help address safety and life cycle cost concerns but it also addresses the risk that unforeseen failures can have on system readiness Effective military operations require 
accurate knowledge of the health of operational assets which can be obtained by using equipment monitoring and assessment technologies This knowledge when combined with the anticipated wear-and-tear effects of the planned mission on each component is vital for optimal planning and mission execution Automated condition assessments and prognostics thus achieve the goal of putting the right asset on the right mission at the right time Low overhead techniques are needed that could provide 
reliable health assessment diagnostics and prognostics of gas turbine accessories Such techniques would enable a shift in maintenance strategies towards condition-based maintenance Solutions to this problem would rely on applying novel algorithms to the existing signal inputs and outputs of the accessory components rather than on the induction of additional sensors which would add significantly to cost and complexity The authors have therefore developed embeddable software modules for autonomous health management 
of gas turbine engine fluid system components These modules allow incipient detection of impending failure and pre-emptive action at opportune times for maintenance An experimental setup was chosen to represent aircraft fuel and lubrication systems Faults were then seeded on the setup and the developed routines were trained and validated with experimental data 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

2 TECHNICAL APPROACH Figure 1 illustrates the developed approach to gas turbine engine fluid system health management The combination of model-based and analytical approaches as shown in the figure captures the physical characteristics of the component along with diagnostic information extracted from analyzing available data from the system This ensures a more confident and reliable prediction The model-based approach ensures that faults are traced back to physically meaningful parameters while the data-driven approach captures higher order dynamics which may be difficult to model Model-based and Data-driven PHM The model-based approach to PHM applies physical modeling and advanced parametric identification techniques As an advantage over black-box or purely data-driven health-monitoring schemes faults and failure modes are traced back to physically meaningful system parameters The approach employs a mathematical dynamic model of the system that is directly tied to the physical processes that drive the health of the component The difference between the simulated response obtained by feeding the control command to the system model and actual response obtained from the system running realtime is used to perform an estimation of system parameters e.g efficiency friction factors etc The estimated parameters are then compared with the baseline parameters to identify isolate and quantify system faults An additional benefit of developing a model for modelbased PHM is that the model can also be used to simulate fault cases or fault levels that are not cost effective or possible to execute on a full-system full-scale odlel Baedi CtoApro CoSigals S;i;,igr1 a1s experimental test platform These faults may be quickly and inexpensively seeded into the model for simulation of the system response Use of available experimental data is however still crucial to this effort for the purpose of tuning and validation In addition to the model-based approach the authors have implemented data-driven techniques to capture information that might be difficult to capture in a physical model owing to model limitations measurement uncertainties higher order effects or other dynamic confounds Data-driven approaches continuously monitor sensor signals and identify differences from baseline signals Faulted conditions may cause certain signals to increase or decrease while having negligible effect on the remaining signals By identifying the signals and features that increase or decrease as compared to baseline operation the presence of various faults may be inferred while the degree of deviation from baseline responses is indicative of the severity of the fault A core concept within the data-driven PHM approach especially when applicable to high bandwidth data is the extraction of features a process that is common within the condition monitoring and automated health management community Fundamentally features represent a reduced set of data or information that can be closely tied to the health of the system The need for feature extraction arises primarily due to a recognized inability to store raw data over long periods of time Second and perhaps more importantly most of the raw data does not contain insightful information Proven techniques for generating features include signal processing and neural network black-box modeling Within the overall PHM architecture these features provide collaborative quantitative evidence of degradation in the system Figure 1 Technical approach 2

6 Fluid viscosity is assumed to be invariant with pressurethis is a good approximation for the small range of pressures encountered in the FSTB A dynamic model of this type might require more resources than available on legacy on-board computing platforms Since the end goal of this research is to develop PHM systems that operate real-time on aircraft platforms a reduced-order model was also developed and validated against the full dynamic model This reduced-order model was developed based on the governing equations of fluid flow in positive displacement pumps and makes the same assumptions as the dynamic model above In addition the reduced-order model also assumes steady state flow The mathematical model is described below For positive displacement pumps the amount of fluid transported per shaft revolution is a fixed quantity which means that at steady state the flow rate delivered is ideally only a function of the pump RPM and is independent of the pressure head developed or the temperature of the fluid However in practice there is a slight dependence of the flow rate on the fluid pressure and temperature even for incompressible fluids owing to the fact that the seals between the stationary and rotating elements within the pump are not perfect Thus there is always a small flow loss due to leakage and this leakage increases with the pressure difference between the outlet and the suction sides In addition leakage flows also vary inversely with the viscosity of the fluid which in turn decreases with the fluid temperature These relationships are summarized in the equation below _ Nq AP 60 RL\(T AP=P-P 1 where q  Flow per revolution GPM I rev N  Shaft RPM RL Q Leakage resistance psi/GPM Flow rate GPM P  Outlet pressure psi Pi  Inlet pressure psi T  Fluid temperature K In Equation 1 above the leakage resistance RL represents the hydraulic resistance offered by the seals to the fluid leakage flow This resistance term is a function of the fluid viscosity RL V 2 where v is the viscosity of the fluid As the above equation shows the resistance to fluid flow increases with increasing fluid viscosity The viscosity of hydraulic fluids may be assumed to vary with temperature in Arrhenius fashion as below v=voexpK-b-j 0 3 where vo is the viscosity at the reference temperature TO and b is the temperature coefficient of viscosity As the above equation indicates viscosity of most liquids decreases with increasing temperature Thus the leakage resistance may be assumed to decrease with temperature as RL  RLO expK-bK T  4 where RLO is the leakage resistance at temperature The leakage flow QL may thus vary with pressure and temperature as below the reference be assumed to QL\(P RAT  R expt b I  Q RL\(T RLO T TO RL PoP Pi T RPK iJe bI IJ QLOQ jexpKbK PLO D RLO 5 where QLO is the leakage flow at the reference conditions P0 To Equation 1 may then be rewritten as Q  Nq QLO p _ p exp b I  60 P iT T 6 Recasting this equation in terms of the pump RPM gives N Q  QLO p expK b K 7 Equation 7 above provides a basis for applying modelbased PHM on the gear pump system 4 


This mathematical model uses the control command signal to predict the system response and the differences between this predicted response and the actual response of the system yield system parameters The estimated parameters are then compared with the baseline health level parameters to identify and isolate system faults and provide a measure of fault severity The pump parameters may be computed

data-driven techniques for fault detection and isolation These techniques utilize real-time parameter observation and monitor signal behavior for increased levels of deviation from the expected baseline profile These techniques do not rely on gauging the proximity and rate of change of the current component condition i.e features to known fault conditions within Ndimensional feature space As part of this approach case of Figure 5 the Euclidean distance between the current state and the fault region representing functional failure becomes gradually smaller was implemented to track and project the features DXS employs were obtained from on past observations These past observations on the system under faulted conditions These data enable the derivation of faulted features i.e features that as some type of degradation begins to are used to predict impending failures Evolutionary Prognostics as the time remaining before the current health state progresses to functional

system failure as well a statistical trending method These projections an exponentially weighted averaging function that an exponential function which are assigned to past observations with the earliest observations receiving the least weightage DXS forecasts was repeated until the predicted feature space cluster approached the functional failure region for any failure mode The advantage of representing fault regions within feature space is that multiple competitive failure modes an earlier section experimental data is needed for training and validation of the developed routines In addition to baseline data the developed routines require data collected a means to map the features obtained from 


Fault Simulation The collection of faulted data requires that known faults be seeded into the system In most cases it would be desirable not to permanently damage the system by introducing the fault and this requirement dictates a careful choice of faults to be simulated as well as their severity levels The faults that were simulated on the setup include 1 Flow loss due to leakage 2 Stuck valve 3 Damaged gear teeth 4 Cavitation These faults were seeded on the FSTB setup as follows Pump seal leakage was simulated by diverting some of the flow from the pump back to the sump bypassing the test section This is illustrated in Figure 6 As a result the pump has to operate at a higher RPM to deliver the same flow to the test section The stuck valve condition was simulated using a gain block which was added to the valve command signal that controls the fractional opening of the valve This simulated valve blockage since a reduction in the effective valve area would cause a higher pressure in the test section Thus the valve controller would compensate by opening the valve further so as to maintain the pressure setpoint Figure 6 Simulating leakage Gear faults were simulated by reducing the flow command to the pump for a fraction of each revolution For example if the gear within the pump which drives fluid flow had five teeth a damaged tooth would cause a reduction in the flow for one fifth of each shaft revolution The extent of this flow reduction would depend upon the severity of the damage Pump cavitation was induced by reducing the supply side pressure to the pump by draining the sump as shown in Figure 7 This also introduces air bubbles into the fluid flow which is another cause of cavitation Figure 7Seeding pump cavitation In addition to the seeded faults just described baseline data were also collected The data consisted of the RPM pressure temperature and flow signals at various operating conditions These data were then used in the model-based and data driven approaches described above to estimate the health of the major components in the system 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The collected data were used to define model parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and measured signals Shifts in these parameters were then evaluated to identify features that indicate the presence of faults on the FSTB setup Some of these features pertained to the pump while others were related to the valve One such feature was a parameter derived from the pump signals This parameter was found to be a good indicator of pump leakage being remarkably invariant over a wide range of operating pressures This model parameter was obtained by feeding the pump RPM signal to the model of the system and predicting the output flow Least-squares minimization of the error between the model-predicted flow and the actual flow read by the flow meter on the setup yielded a best-fit value for this parameter Figure 8 shows the value of this model parameter for the various fault cases simulated on the FSTB The top half of the figure shows the mean and standard deviation error bars represent 2611 standard deviation of this feature for each fault case including the baseline while the bottom half shows the same parameter over each data run for each of the fault cases 6

Real-time Implementation and Demonstration The authors have developed a software Graphical User Interface GUI to enable real-time implementation of the PHM analysis techniques described in this paper A screenshot of this GUI is shown in Figure 18 Figure 18 Screenshot of real-time implementation interface The interface allows the user to control the flow temperature and pressure setpoints to the setup The user may choose to view the feedback signals from the setup or as shown in Figure 18 to observe the results of the PHM analysis These PHM results are computed on-the-fly using real-time sensor data from the setup The interface allows the seeding of software faults such as gear and valve faults into the setup The PHM results shown in the figure include health indices and mean times to failure and confidences thereof for the pump and valve as well as the actual and model-predicted flow pressure and RPM signals The parameters obtained from the model-based analysis are also displayed along with the baseline values of these parameters In addition the interface has indicators to alert the user to certain critical faults in the setup such as gear damage and cavitation which might require immediate shutdown and maintenance on the setup 5 CONCLUSIONS Gas turbine engine accessory components such as pumps valves and actuators create a majority of the maintenance issues in aircraft gas turbine systems A combination of model-based and data-driven approaches was implemented to address the problem of predicting and forecasting the health of these accessory components Experimental data were collected on a test setup representative of aircraft fuel and lubrication systems and these data were used to train a developed model of the system as well as data-driven routines The model-based routines yielded features that uniquely correlated to pump and valve faults The datadriven routines yielded a feature which picked out pump cavitation There was a one-to-one correspondence between the developed features and the faults indicated by these features The routines were validated with additional experimental data from the FSTB setup The authors have also developed evolutionary prognostics routines based on the DXS algorithm for the purpose of trending and tracking the progress of fault features in feature space In addition a demonstration interface was developed to enable real-time implementation of the developed techniques These techniques constitute a significant initial step towards addressing the issue of on-board diagnostics and prognostics for gas turbine accessory components 6 FUTURE WORK Work will continue to streamline the developed PHM routines and to develop data fusion routines to merge the results of model-based and data-driven algorithms The applicability of the developed PHM algorithms may be extended to a variety of gas turbine engine fluid systems such as engine compressor and nozzle systems starting systems and Auxiliary Power Units APUs and fuel and lube systems Engine fluid system reliability data may be included to improve the fidelity of the PHM algorithms in predicting impending failures and Remaining Useful Life RUL given current health status and envisioned use In addition dedicated PHM system prototypes may be developed for fuel and lubrication system health assessment and these prototypes may be tested on OEM test cells 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work has significantly benefited from the invaluable support and technical input from the Wright Patterson Air Force Base The authors would also like to acknowledge financial support for this work provided through the Air Force Small Business Innovative Research SBIR program In addition we would like to recognize the contributions of our colleague Matthew Smith 8 REFERENCES 1 DUSD\(LMR CBM+Memorandum November 2002 Available at Defense Acquisition Guidebook 2 Department of Defense Web site DoD Instruction 5.2 3.,9,2,,asp3.9.2 3 Pratt and Whitney Web site ht pr 4 J Rhoades JSF System Development and Demonstration CodeOne Magazine 17 2002 Available on-line at 11
