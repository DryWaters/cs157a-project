Abstract-Considering 
the cross-chain inventory collaboration in the cluster supply chain this paper discussed and comparatively analyzed two models the one is cross-chain inventory complementarity between enterprises of same tier and the other one is cross-chain inventory complementarity between enterprises of different tiers with the 
methods of system dynamics simulation By the analysis of the simulation data the paper found that using inventory complementarity between enterprises of different tiers can lead to a higher satisfaction rate of customer demand without big changes of inventory and can maintain this large satisfaction rate stably Therefore from the perspective of the inventory and customer satisfaction rate the complementarity model between enterprises of different tiers is superior to the model between enterprises of 
same tier 
NlRODUCTION With the rapid development of Chinese economy peoples pay more and more attention to the industry cluster problem which as the important problem in industry development and regional economies development 1 Clusters represent a kind of new spatial organizational form in between arm's-length markets on the one hand and hierarchies or vertical integration on the other.[2 So there exist a lot of parallel single-supply-chains And the enterprises which in the

cluster supply chain not only cooperate with each other in the single supply chain but also exist cooperation in the cross-chain which can make the industry cluster suitable to the variability market demand reduce the searching cost improve the service level and expand the cognizing of the cluster market[3 4 This trend makes the research of supply chain management change to the problem of supply chain of multi\255 chains cross-chain Competitive-Cooperation On the study of cross-chain inventory of cluster supply chain Li Jizi et al\(2007 
have researched one-pipeline inventory collaboration policy OPICP cluster supply chain and dual-pipeline inventory collaboration policy DPICP cluster supply chain Fig 1  but their studies based on the inventory collaboration only occur between enterprises of the same supply chain tier This study researched the model of cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of different tiers and contrast with the model of cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of same tiers 978-1-4244-2013-1/08/$25.00 2512008 IEEE Weiguo Chen Jiangsu Fangtian Construction Consulting Ltd Yancheng,China Fig

bases on the analysis of practical operation of industry cluster with the methods of system dynamics simulation thereby find out the more advantage model for industry cluster II SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Suppose the cluster chain is composed of two single supply chains which has three tiers Each tier has one Producer one Distributor and one Retailer The two supply chains deal in same product Both supply chain 1 SCI and supply chain 2 SC2 adopt fix quantity order method 
The model ofDPICP 
So the expectation inventory of each enterprise equal to the average selling rate multiply by the maintenance time which the expectation inventory hopes for 5 The yield of producer distributor and retailer's order are decided by average fill rate or average selling rate In the same time the order modifies the inventory and makes 
reaches the expectation inventory Otherwise when one of the supply chains has superfluous stock after filled its consumer demand it will send products to another There will have two kinds of 
it 
models as following

A The Model of Cross chain Inventory Complementarily Between Enterprises of Same Tier 
Because of the uncertain market demand when the upstream enterprise can't fill the demand of the downstream enterprise the same tier enterprise of the other supply chain will send products to it namely cross-chain inventory complementarily between enterprises of same tier CICBEST Fig 2 SCl
