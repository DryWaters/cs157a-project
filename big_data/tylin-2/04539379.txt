  Hiding Fuzzy Association Rules in Quantitative Data   Tolga BERBEROGLU and Mehmet KAYA Data Mining and Bioinformatics Laboratory Department of Computer Engineering, F\004rat University, 23119, Elaz\004 001 Turkey kaya@firat.edu.tr  Abstract  Data mining and knowledge discovery from databases are researches in which unknown associations automatically discovered from big amounts of data Advances in data collection data distribution and related technologies caused researchers to investigate current data mining algorithms from a new point of view. This is person al privacy With the increase in researches on data mining and sharing of knowledge with many people thru the internet and media, personal privacy probl ems are considered more seriously Many techniques have  been recently developed against bad purposed data mining These techniques are classified into differ ent categories. In the first of these categories, calle d input privacy, the data is manipulated, and the mining re sult is not affected or minimally affected The second t ype of privacy is called as output privacy, where the d ata is altered This change makes the mining result preserving certain privacy In output privacy spec ific rules that should be hidden are given in advance According to this constraint many data altering techniques for hiding association classification a nd clustering rules have been proposed in the literatu re However, almost all of them have been done on binar y items But in real world the data mostly consist of quantitative values. In this paper, we propose a no vel method to hide critical fuzzy association rules fro m quantitative data For this purpose we increase support value of LHS of the rule to be hidden Experimental results demonstrate the performance an d output effects of the proposed algorithm  1. Introduction  Privacy preserving in data mining means hiding outp ut knowledge of data mining by using several methods when this output data is valuable and private Ther e have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. The first type of privacy, called input pri vacy is that the data is manipulated so that the mining results is not affected or minimally affected [1   In the second type of privacy called output privac y given critical rules or patterns to be hidden, the data is minimally altered so that the mining result preserv e certain privacy [2   F o r  t h i s  p u r p o s e   r e c e n t l y   W a ng et al 2  p r o p o s e d  I S L   I n c r e a s e  S u p p o r t  o f  L H S   a n d  DSR \(Decrease Support of RHS\ algorithms for binary  transactions. In order to increase support value of LHS in ISL method, transactions are modified in a way t hat LHS items having the value 0 are converted to the value 1 Therefore confidence value is decreased In order to decrease support value of RHS in DSR method, LHS items having the value 1 are converted to the value 0, so that trying to obtain a confidence value that is lower than minimum confidence value There are also other researches similar to the ones  stated above aiming to prevent bad purposed data mining [3-5   A l l  o f  t h e m  w e r e  d o n e  o n  b i n a r y  v a l u e s However in real world the data mostly consist of quantitative values. Some work has recently been do ne on the use of fuzzy sets in discovering association rules for quantitative attributes 6 7   U n l i k e  c l a s s i c a l set theory where membership is binary the fuzzy set theory introduced by Zadeh 8  p r o v i d e s  e x c e l l e n t  means to model the fuzzy boundaries of linguistic  terms by introducing gradual membership Some example linguistic terms include poor young rich”, “excellent”, etc In this paper, we present a novel method for preven ting extraction of critical association rules from quant itative data by combining previous researches and taking th em to one step ahead Those previous researches are IS L method that prevents extraction of critical associa tion rules 2  a n d  f u z z y  d a t a  m i n i n g  a l g o r i t h m  f r o m  quantitative data [6   T h e  r e s t  o f  t h i s  p a p e r  i s  o r ganized as follows Privacy preserving rule problem in quantitative data is defined in Section 2.

  2. Problem Definition  As mentioned earlier almost all of studies propose d hide association rules were done on binary valued d ata However in real world data usually contains quantitative values For example in a patient’s bl ood test, many attributes can be found. However, instea d of this presence attribute’s quantity in blood is mor e important for determination of illness Every peopl e have the problem of cholesterol, but this doesn’t m ean that one is sick or not the only criterion for determination of illness is the surplus in choleste rol’s quantity In previously presented data mining methods whether they are using binary values or they are us ing quantitative values, it is possible to extract asso ciation rules that threaten personal privacy Especially in  medical intuitions there are databases including v ery extensive information about patients Possible bad purposed usage of those databases threatens persona l privacy of patients There are some recent examples  about this type of usage. For example; Kiser, one o f the most important medical institutes of United States sent 858 e-mail messages by mistake Those messages contained IDs of users and their answers for their illnesses and the questions as well All of those messages were sent to wrong receivers Washington Post 10 August 2000 In another example Global Healttrax an online firm selling health products sent names, home phones, bank account numbers and credit  card data through their website by mistake MSNBC  19 January 2000  3. The Proposed Algorithm  In a quantitative database, if a critical rule X 002 Y needs to be hidden its confidence value is decreased to a value smaller than the minimum confidence value. On e way of decreasing confidence value is increasing th e support value of an item X at LHS, and the other way is decreasing support value of an item Y  at RHS to a value lower than the minimum support value In our method, in order to decrease confidence valu e of a rule, we increase the support value of an item at LHS For this purpose, the value of item in LHS is subtr acted from 1 in the case the value of item in LHS is lowe r than 0.5 and than value of item in RHS Abbreviations used in the proposed algorithm are gi ven as follows Initial database with n  transaction data D fuzzified database F a set of predicting items X transact ions belong to a LHS item, T L transactions belong to a RHS item, T R rule, U  Input  1\ a source database D 2\ a min_support 3\ a min_confidence 4\ a set of predicting items X  Output  1     Fuzzification of the database, D 001 F 2  In fuzzified database F, calculate every item’s support value where f  F 3  If all f\(support\< min_support;EXIT:. // there isn’t any rule 4  Find Large 2_itemsets in F 5  For each X’s large 2 itemsets 6  Calculate tthe support value of the rule U 001  min\(U L U R  7  if rule U\(support\ > min_support 8  Calculate Rule U \(confidence 9  if rule U\(confidence\ > min_sonfidence 10  for each T L of rule 11  if  T L 0.5 and T L T R  12  T L 1 - T L  13  end  // if 14  end // for each 15  end // for each 16  Re-calculate confidence value of rule U 17  if rule U\(confidence\ > min_confidence 18  remove all T L and return to initial form 19  end // if 20  end // for each 21  F 001 prune the database. F 001 D 22  end   4. Stages of the Algorithm  An association rule is defined as an implication X 001 Y where both X  and Y  are defined as sets of attributes interchangeably called items\ [9   H e r e   X is called as the body \(LHS\ of the rule and Y is called as the head RHS of the rule it is interpreted as follows f or a specified fraction of the existing transactions a particular value of an attribute set X  determines the value of attribute set Y  as another particular value under a certain confidence For instance an association rule in a supermarket basket data may b e stated as in 20 of the transactions 75 of the people buying butter also buy milk in the same transaction 20 and 75 represent the support and  the confidence respectively The significance of a n association rule is measured by its support and confidence Simply support is the percentage of transactions that contain both X  and Y  while confidence is the ratio of the support of Y X 001 to the support of X So, the problem can be stated as find all

  association rules that satisfy user-specified minim um support and confidence  STEP 1 Transform the quantitative value j v  of each item j i  entered into a fuzzy set represented as    2 2 1 1 jl jl j j j j R f R f R f    by using the given membership functions for item quantities, where l is the number of regions for j i  STEP 2 Calculate the count of each attribute region  linguistic term R jk in the transaction data as 002   n i jk jk f count 1  STEP 3 Check whether jk count of each R jk  over n is larger than or equal to the predefined minimum supp ort value If R jk satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of large-1 itemsets L 1  STEP 4 Join the large itemsets  L 1  to generate the candidate set C 2  Two regions belonging to the same item cannot simultaneously exist in an itemset in C 2  STEP 5 Calculate the fuzzy value of each transactio n data as j I j I f Min f 2 1   Then, calculate the fuzzy count of I in the transactions as 002   n i i I I f count 1  STEP 6 According to user specified minimum confidence value rules are extracted A confidence  value of a Ao 001 Bo rule is computed as follows  Confidence\(Ao 001 Bo  Support\(Ao Bo Support\(Ao  STEP 7 Critical rules are determined. Then in order to hide the rules confidence values are tried to be decreased This is achieved by one of two strategie s The first one is to increase the support count of A o i.e LHS of the rule but not support count of Bo Ao   The second one is to decrease the support the support count of the itemset Bo Ao        Support\(Ao Bo Support\(Ao Bo Ao Confidence  An Example In this section an example is give to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. This is a simple example to sho w how the proposed algorithm can be used to hide crit ical fuzzy association rules from a set of quantitative transaction data Table 1.

The membership functions used in this examp le  In this example, each item has three fuzzy regions  z  o  and b  Thus three fuzzy membership values are produced for each item according to the predefined membership functions Note that only the same set o f membership functions is used all the items for simplicity. Minimum support and confidence values a re set at 2.2 and 75 respectively Fuzzification of transaction data is given in Table 2  If we take Ao 001 Bz Support 2.4 and Confidence 100%\ as an a critical rule, our aim will be decrea sing the value of Confidence\(Ao 001 Bz by decreasing the value of Support\(AoBz or by increasing the value o f Support\(Ao In order to increase the value of Support\(Ao we subtract Ao from 1 in the case Ao is  lower than Bz   Table 2.

  Confidence\(Ao  Bz  100 2.4 2.4  Support\(Ao Bz Support\(Ao    To hide critical fuzzy association rule Ao  Bz transaction T 3  in item A is modified from 0.2 to 10.2=0.8. The new database is shown in Table 4   Table 3. Fuzzy values of items, Ao and Bz   Ao Bz Support T 1 1 1 1 T 2  0 0 0 T 3  0.2 0.6 0.2 T 4  0.4 1 0.4 T 5  0.8 0.8 0.8 Count 2.4  2.4    Table 4.

The procedure is denoted in Tab le 5 and Table 6 Thus, we obtain a smaller confidence value to hide the relevant rule as shown in the following formula. Si nce this value is lower than minimum confidence value the rule is hidden from the user. After modifying the v alues in the transactions new fuzzy database is obtained  This is shown in Table 7  Table 5.

Experimental Results  In order to understand characteristics of the propo sed algorithm in a numerical way we have done several numbers of experiments and observed the output effects For the experiments a computer having an Intel Centrino 1.6 processor and 512MB RAM is used  In the software side Windows XP operating system wa s running We applied the proposed algorithm to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer database from UCI Machine Learning Repository [10   T h e  d a t a b a s e  c o n s i s t s  o f  10 attributes and one of them is categorical Thus we  ignored this categorical attribute We conducted three different experiments The first  experiment is dedicated to show the relationship between number of total and hidden rules, and numbe r of transactions. In this experiment, as minimum sup port values are taken as 24, 48, 62 and 74, respectively the minimum confidence value is set at 70 The results  are depicted in Fig. 2 The second experiment deals with finding the number  of total and hidden rules for different values of minimum support at 200 transactions. As can be easi ly seen from Fig 3 the number of rule decreases with  increase of minimum support value. In this experime nt the size of data set is 200 The final experiment finds the number of total and hidden rules for different values of minimum confidence The results are reported in Fig 4 whi ch demonstrates that the number of hidden rules quickl y rises with the increase of minimum confidence value as the number of total rule decreases slowly  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 50 100 150 200 Number of Transaction Number of Rules Total Rules Hidden Rules  Fig. 2.

7 HEURISTIc FAULT IDENTIFICATION The IMS processes monitoring the ISS Control Moment Gyroscopes can alert the controllers when a CMG deviates from typical behavior but the basic IMS routines do not identify the fault that caused the deviation The ADCO controllers would like to receive explicit alerts in the event of particular CMG faults when possible Some of these fault signatures are straightforward enough to encode as monitoring rules and integrate with the IMS console software One relatively common but recoverable CMG fault is a transient condition in the CMG electronics assembly that the ADCO controllers call an EA Fault This event is characterized by a brief electrical current spike beyond a threshold value accompanied by the setting of an error bit in the electronics assembly A routine was added to the IMS monitoring software that watches for the occurrence of an appropriately sized current spike and the setting of the electronics assembly fault bit within a short time window If both of these events occur within that time span IMS will set an EA Fault bit on the ISP data stream to alert the controllers of the incident Another less frequent incident is a Loss of Comm fault that occurs when a CMG experiences problems with the network connection to the ISS computer responsible for commanding the unit and gathering CMG sensor data This event is automatically recognized by ISS on-board fault detection logic which initiates a recovery procedure to reestablish the connection This recovery procedure results in transmission of several specific status messages to the ground controllers Watching for these status changes allows the IMS Loss of Comm detection routine to detect when the event has occurred and set the appropriate alert bit in the ISP data server The routine also detects when a successful recovery has occurred and resets the alert bit Although these heuristic fault identification abilities do not cover all possible fault scenarios they add value by enabling the controller to quickly determine the cause of these more common anomalies This can be particularly useful for less experienced controllers who may not have seen these particular fault signatures Additional fault detection routines may be incorporated in the future 8 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK Through practical application it has been demonstrated that data driven system health monitoring applications can be useful in a space mission operations setting Many spacecraft have extensive archives of telemetry data available that can be advantageously exploited by data mining methods Two data mining tools Orca and the Inductive Monitoring System have been used to analyze data from the Space Shuttle and International Space Station to search for anomalous data points that could be indications of a fault or damage to the spacecraft Providing information on possible system anomalies in a timely manner provides controllers and mission support engineers with helpful decision support and enables more efficient and effective execution of their duties The inclusion of fault identification routines further simplifies their tasks These initial tool deployments in the NASA JSC mission control center have demonstrated the utility and effectiveness of data driven system health monitoring methods in two disciplines but the applications are not limited to just these examples There are many areas with rich archived data repositories where these and similar techniques can be applied Mission controllers from several ISS disciplines including power management thermal control and life support have expressed interest in similar system monitoring tools Now that the software has been integrated with the mission control data systems expansion of the capability is primarily a matter of identifying relevant parameters to monitor and performing the archived data analysis Work is beginning now to develop monitoring capability for ISS thermal control systems Eventually we plan to develop tools that allow mission controllers to build their own data driven monitoring applications They will specify which parameters to monitor what time periods to include in the nominal training data and any computations that should be performed on the raw telemetry data The tool set will retrieve the desired archived training data remove spurious data points using outlier detection and build a new monitoring knowledge base and an appropriate monitoring application configuration to run on their control console A useful enhancement to the current monitoring software would be the ability to automatically detect operating mode changes in the monitored system and switch to a targeted monitoring knowledge base developed specifically for that mode For instance the ISS is flown in different orientations and configurations during different mission phases The behavior of the CMGs can differ in the various configurations Rather than building one large knowledge base per CMG that covers all cases as in the current deployment a separate knowledge base could be built from archived data collected during each ISS configuration then consulted for real-time monitoring when the ISS is in that configuration This would provide more accurate and efficient monitoring capability Another application of data driven monitoring to explore is the use of supervised learning methods to help identify fault signatures If examples of fault behavior are available in the archived data supervised learning algorithms such as decision tree or support vector machine based techniques may be able to analyze the data and distinguish between 7 


different types of fault behavior and normal operation If the monitored system exhibits unusual behavior fault characterizations from the supervised learning algorithm could help controllers identify the cause of the anomaly These techniques could allow automated fault identification in cases that are too complex to be encoded in heuristic rules ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author would like to thank the following collaborators who directly supported and contributed to the development and deployment of the mission control software described in this paper From NASA Ames Research Center Rick Alena Charles Lee SAIC Dawn McIntosh Mark Schwabacher Lilly Spirkovska and William Taylor From NASA Johnson Space Center Tatiana Dobrinskaya USA Ann Esbeck USA Tammy Gafka Joshua Johnson Keith Martin TSI and Charles McCann REFERENCES 1 Stephen D Bay and Mark Schwabacher Mining Distance-Based Outliers in Near Linear Time with Randomization and a Simple Pruning Rule Proceedings of The Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2003 2 David L Iverson Inductive System Health Monitoring Proceedings of The 2004 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence IC-AI04 Las Vegas Nevada June 2004 CSREA Press 9 M Schwabacher N Oza and B Matthews Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Propulsion Health Monitoring Proceedings of the AIAA Infotech\(4,Aerospace Conference Reston VA American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc 2007 10 R A Martin M Schwabacher N Oza and A Srivastava Comparison of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods for Systems Health Management Using Space Shuttle Main Engine Data  Proceedings of the JANNAF Propulsion Meeting 2007 BIOGRAPHY David Iverson has worked as a computer engineer in the Intelligent Systems Division at the NASA Ames Research Center for more than two decades During most of that time he has been involved in integrated system health management ISHM for spacecraft aircraft and scientific payload systems He has investigated several aspects of this field including reasoning from system fault models model based monitoring and diagnosis and data driven techniques for system monitoring Most recently he has developed and applied the Inductive Monitoring System data driven anomaly detection software He is the NASA Ames project leadfor deployment of data driven monitoring for JSC mission control applications He received his B.S from the University of Puget Sound where he studied Computer Science Mathematics and Physics He also holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University 3 Mission Control Center Platform Services System Information Sharing Protocol User's Guide NASA Document CSOC-JSC-UG-002098 April 2002 4 MSK-View Users Guide Version 3.4 September 1997 5 RTPLOT Reference Guide NASA Operations Document JSC-26101 August 1998 6 ELOG Reference Guide NASA Operations Document JSC-26101 July 1998 7 Adam Dershowitz Advanced Tool of Math ATOM Users Guide Version 02.03.06 July 2006 8 Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report Volume 1 August 2003 8

This sign al is used to indicate to the APU controller that the FCM is not yet ready to receive the next load data The FPU constantly t oggles this line as part of its internal synchronization l ogic that lets it operate at half the clock rate of the FCB When other cores are present on the FCB toggling the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal interferes with their operation since the FCB is basically a wired-or bus. This was the case with the dot-product co-processor which would not load data correctly with the FPU toggling the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal. According to Xilinx, the FPU only needs to use the FCMAPULOADWAIT  signal under two conditions 1  The APU controller sends the two halves of a double precision load transfer back-to-back, and the FPU c an’t keep up 2  The APU controller flushes an outstanding operation  and then immediately provides load data to the FPU before it has had time to process the flush The first scenario does not apply to this design as  the FPU only supports single-precision floating-point opera tion The second scenario is, according to Xilinx, “unlikely although the probability of it happening depends on the code  being executed. Since the FPU implementation is hidden fr om the developer the only possible but not ideal soluti on to this issue is to disconnect the FCMAPULOADWAIT signal from the FPU Future releases of XPS will most likely fi x this issue at its source Table 8  Execution times for system with dot-product and FPU co-processors, SP math functions, and DP Perflib  SW Optimizations None base system SP Math IBM Perflib  HW Optimizations None base system APU-FPU \(100 MHz Dot-prod \(200 MHz  PPC405 Freq 200 MHz 200 MHz  Interferograms 1 1  Detectors 1 1  Software Component Time \(sec Time \(sec Speedup Re-sampling 1197.7938 149.3297 8.02x Spectrum \(Phase Correction, FFT 117.4963 14.3675 8.18x TOTAL 1315.2901 163.6972 8.03x     8 The updated FPU should be available in future rele ases of XPS The results in Table 8 show only a small improvemen t over the execution times observed with an FPU-only syste m no dot-product co-processor, Table 6\. One explanation for this is a higher than expected overhead in getting the d ata from memory to the dot-product co-processor To confirm this theory a number of similar systems were built and the performance of the dot-product core was compared to  the FPU when working with a smaller data set both from external DDR2 memory and on-chip block ram BRAM memory Perflib  was used in all tests to optimize software performance The CPU frequency was fixed to 200 MHz  The results are summarized in Table 9 below Table 9  Dot-product core testing with smaller data set Mem Type SW sec FPU sec Dot-prod sec Dot-prod Speedup BRAM 0.0065  0.00032 20.26x DDR2 0.0026  0.00042 6.13x BRAM  0.00070 0.00032 2.18x DDR2  0.00082 0.00042 1.94x  A few conclusions can be made from the data above First the dot-product core is about twice the speed of th e FPU when not starved for data.  It is clearly evident t hat working with a smaller more contiguous data set results in  better performance than working with larger less organize d chunks of data, as seen in the FTIR spectrometry al gorithm Additionally, both the FPU and the dot-product co-p rocessor achieve better execution times when the data set is  stored entirely in BRAM The results also indicate that th e performance of the dot-product co-processor is not significantly affected by the addition of the FPU t o the FCB in other words the two co-processors sharing the s ame bus are not slowing each other down Even though the do tproduct core is a valid co-processor, it only impro ves system performance under favorable memory access condition s which is not the case in the FTIR spectrometry algo rithm  Fig 15  Profiling results for system with dot-product and FPU co-processors, SP math functions, and DP Perflib  In the execution time profile Figure 15 the dotprod_ function is shown to consume less CPU time than bef ore With both the FPU and dot-product co-processor the  


 11 dotprod_ function consumes 2.95 of the CPU time compared to the previously observed value of 9.97 Figure 10 However this does not mean the function execu ted faster. In fact, as seen in the results in Table 8 the speedup is negligible compared to an FPU-only system Table  6 The value for dotprod_ function is lower because the profiler does not include helper functions that are  called within the dotprod_ function otherwise the function main would consume 100% of CPU time\. These helper funct ions could include various low level data copy and manip ulation operations. In fact, the profile now shows new func tions that take up significant CPU time that were not visible before for example memcpy  The cumulative contribution of the helper functions to the overall execution time is t he reason why little speedup is seen with the dot-product coprocessor even with the dotprod_ function itself taking up less CPU time 6  R ESULTS A NALYSIS  Table 10 presents the execution times of all system s described in this paper Without a doubt the two s oftware optimizations using single-precision math library and Perflib  and the inclusion of the APU-FPU core together provide impressive speedup across the board That i s because the aforementioned optimizations affect nea rly all portions of the FTIR software improving both singl eprecision SP math functions and APU-FPU as well a s double-precision arithmetic Perflib  The dot-product co-processor core, however, has alm ost no effect on the system performance. This is most like ly due to the noncontiguous pattern of memory access in the d otproduct computation of the FTIR spectrometry algori thm As was shown earlier, smaller more uniformly access ed data sets can achieve nearly 2x speedup over the FPU whe n using the dot-product co-processor Comparing the best performing FTIR system build on the ML410 development board to a V2P based NASA JPL implementation in 7  s h o w s  a n  o v e r a l l  s p e e d u p  o f  1 78x Table 11 The results of the best performing FTIR  build are first scaled to the appropriate number of inter ferograms and detectors to match what was used in the NASA JP L V2P research task.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
