numerous sources Its applications can be found in a variety of technology settings from robotics structural and vehicle health monitoring to communications space science and telemedicine This work is a canonical overview of several major fusion architectures developed from the remote sensing and defense community We present several types of architecture for managing multi-sensor data fusion specifically as they relate to the tracking-correlation function and blackboard processing representations in knowledge 
engineering Object-Process Methods are used to model the information fusion process and supporting subsystems Finally we discuss the importance of fusion to the concept and operation of the Semantic Web Semantic networks offer powerful ways to exploit the synergy of multi-sensor data platforms Their operation is based on synthesis of fusion with ontology models for knowledge representation We discuss the importance of fusion as a reuse process in ontological engineering and 
review key lifecycle models in ontology development The evolutionary approach to ontology development is considered the most useful and adaptable to the complexities of semantic networks Several potential applications for data fusion are screened and ranked according to the Joint Directors of Laboratories JDL process model for information fusion Based on these predetermined criteria the case of medical diagnostic imaging was found to offer the most promising applications for fusion on which future

applications technologies and communities of interest It refers in a broad sense to the processing and distribution of data from two or more sources to obtain a property of an environment or object Common sensor devices include video cameras range finders tactile sensors and sonar Environments may include oceanic or terrestrial surfaces airborne or ground-based combat zones warehouse facilities and web-based retail e.g Fig.1-1 The list of stakeholders grows as new forms of sensors are 
developed and applied to data-rich environments The following definitions are culled from the remote sensing community where fusion concepts and nomenclature have been matured over several decades Image fusion is the combination of two or more different images to form a new image by using a certain algorithm Pohl and Van Genderen 1998 Techniques which combine data from multiple sensors and related information from associated databases to 
achieve improved accuracy and more specific inferences than could be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone Hall and Llinas 1990 A multilevel multifacetedprocess dealing with the automatic detection association correlation estimation and combination of data and information from multiple sources  US Department ofDefense 1991 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 C 2008

r t  CLASSIFICATION There are significant limitations due to single sensors that should be mentioned For instance weather clutter and noise may interfere with the recognition of an object by a single sensor system A key determinant to the success of a single sensor system is the orientation of the mission and 2 NOISE SOURCES ENTITY to Emissions sensor DETECTION F[E t conversion to  ESTIMATION observation Figure 1-1 Data fusion example Image Superposition from 3 data sources Systems Engineering Context Steinberg identified three systems engineering challenges in data fusion 1 Firstly how should uncertainty be modeled both in sensory observations and in the phenomenon which produce those observations Secondly how should systems aggregate non-commensurate sensory data i.e imagery text and signals Finally how should multiple observations under singleand multi-source conditions be correlated processed and maintained Steinberg elaborates on the notion of data visibility with an analogy to resource management Both resource management and data fusion rely on a certain level of granularity for effect The former technique results in action the latter in estimation As sensor design is pushed beyond conventional measures of estimation so too will the expected impact of fusion data It is thus critical that the synergies between data fusion and neighboring domains be leveraged At its core data fusion is an information-theoretic process enabled through hardware and software products and systems Subjects such as quality assurance and risk assessment are less developed in the information domain relative to traditional hardware fields like aerospace or nuclear engineering This provides a unique opportunity for the practitioner community to extend the Data Fusion knowledge base and taxonomy across all phases of system engineering When held to similar notions of reliability and utility as mechanical components sensor data might codify a more holistic framework for specifying product requirements or mission objectives 2 SENSORS AND SENSOR PLATFORMS The value of data fusion lies in the breadth of sensor categories available to the designer The traditional applications normally cull these sensors from the electromagnetic spectrum For instance in data fusion through remote sensing electro-magnetic energy reflected or emitted from objects is measured and reported However the energy from acoustic ultrasonic magnetic and seismic waves all offer potentially rich sources of information on which to design fusion system architectures Single Sensor Systems A sensor is comprised of a transducer which converts energy entering an aperture into lower frequencies from which targets and background information may be discerned through a data processor Digital sensors actuators and low power RF radios all help to enable the functionality of a single sensor system NSF Directorate for Computer and information Science and Engineering through integration of a single chip in a processor's memory Figure 2-1 illustrates the basic components of a typical sensor system Examples of sensor apertures include antennas for RF energy optics for IR-UV-visible light energy and microphones/hydrophones for acoustical energy Figure 2-1 A sensor system adapted from Waltz and Llinas 1990  Additive noise DETECTION  Signal dispersion PHENOMENON E t  Multiple paths MEDIUM TRANSMISSION OR EVENT airplane  s  


whether there are sufficient data processing resources that are localized in each sensor 2 Multi-sensor systems Multi-sensor systems offer numerous advantages over single sensors when it comes to the fundamental tasks of utilizing and delivering information toward a specific objective For instance Landsat1 the first earth observation satellite launched in 1972 was a historical program designed to obtain information on agricultural and forestry resources geology and mineral resources hydrology pollution oceanography and marine resources among other objectives The system acquired visible light and near infrared earth photos as well as radiometric Earth images through a multi-sensor vidicon and multi-spectral scanner The data was processed and stored in wide-band video tape recorders which offered near-global coverage capability3 The combination of microwave millimeter wave infrared and visible sensors has also been used in daily weather forecasting Furthermore the collection of ground-based and aerial sensor data has been useful for characterizing the targets which are being imaged by these sensors Active versus Passive Sensors Sensors are often classified as either active or passive depending on their signal conditioning An active sensor requires external sources of excitation while passive sensors generate their own electrical output without requiring external voltages or currents The need then for external active circuitry to produce electrical output signals from the sensor determine whether structurally a sensor should be classified as active or passive In the microwave spectrum these definitions take on a slightly different meaning Active microwave sensors provide their own source of radiation to illuminate a target as in RADAR imaging They use radio waves to detect objects and determine their position range or shape Active sensors tend to provide more information than passive sensors at the cost of increased power consumption and interference when other active sensors are in operation and easier detectability of the sensor For instance active MMW radars operate in mono-static and bi-static configurations In the former the transmitter and receiver are collocated on the same platform so that the receiver processes energy that is backscattered from objects in the field of view FOV In the bi-static mode the transmitter and receiver are spatially disconnected reducing the type and versatility of applications Passive microwave sensors record energy emitted by the atmosphere or surface reflected by the surface or transmitted from the subsurface Another example of a purely passive sensor is an electro-optical sensor which in 3 Retrieved from Wikipedia.com military applications can offer stealthy non-detectable operation Since passive sensors depend on naturally occurring energy they are limited in the location and timing of their operation For instance the amount of solar radiation at polar latitudes is insufficient for visible light sensors during the polar night and limits the use of passive detectors to low latitudes The Thematic Mapper on Landsat satellites is an important exception to this design limitation as it taps into seven different sensor bands These bands are sensitive to numerous ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to thermal infrared portions of the spectrum The Landsat is therefore launched at strategic times to ensure that the satellite will make passes during optimal periods of solar radiation sunsynchronous orbits Sensor Platforms A sensor platform is a vehicle or system used to carry the sensor Example platforms are shown in Figure 2-2 Typical sensor platforms in the C4ISR arena include satellites and aircraft manned or unmanned but can also include balloon kits for low-level surveillance remote sensing ladder trucks and a host of other mobile or stationary devices The fundamental selection factor is the altitude that determines the ground resolution in turn sets the IFOV Instantaneous field of view of the sensor on board4 Figure 2-2 a Wireless Reconfigurable Platform Ground-based sensors offer some cost advantages in terms of maintenance and operation compared to aerial platforms They can be placed on structures in buildings towers or on board terrain vehicles The complexity and maintenance of the ground-based sensor is dependent on the design involved For instance highly complex phased array antennas are ground-based sensors with thousands of apertures array elements see Figure 2-2 b The advent of AESA Active Electronically Steered Arrays has replaced 3 Retrieved from The GIS Development Portal 3

The Semantic Web in the words of Tim Berners Lee Chair Worldwide Web Consortium is the application of weblike design to data Its structure will foster environments where software agents more efficiently and form more all the more challenging to ascertain when the ontology is complete Figure 3-1 Lifecycle Development Models Life 7r tiort}h no predetermined metric of quality it is more flexible by allowing the designer to return to any component at use that metadata to enhance processing in a specific ontology The machine analogy made by Berners-Lee is applicable here if there is any point in time But because there is mean for the data generated in source ontologies require periodic updating in order to refresh the cycle of evolution which takes place Fusion as a Re-use Process Ontology an allocated domain space Finally the third stage of concept evolution in the Semantic Web relates to the notion of metadata processing That is an evolving prototype lifecycle Figure 3-1 5 It requires constant iteration within and between the fundamental steps in development namely specification conceptualization formalization implementation and maintenance The evolving lifecycle for ontology is different from the sequential waterfall approach can pick up data on the fly and then or strings 2 Universal Resource Identifiers URIs identify the or improvements but rather unique ontologies that have been developed from similar subject material In composition/integration ontologies are used for concepts 1 numbers source ontologies from the new applications to be defined same thing in all contexts and 3 dereferencable URIs What does this evolution same subject These prrduct NV4teMl lRerafive Evolvinxg Ontologies must confer both structure and flexibility in order for the Semantic Web to function They can be used to enhance web searches based on precise rather than ambiguous concepts But they also must tailor to the decentralized nature of the web and web services For this aseangement to work we propose that a knowledge representation system has a degree of hierarchy to it The syntactic problems have begun to be addressed in developing the web through Semantic Web Language SWL Formal ontologies and models for their development can play an important role in resolving the semantic issues i.e giving names to the basic concepts of the data and writing rules to take advantage of their connections In managing this process the are not revisions are two commonly accepted modes of so that computers so that friendly a semantic web machine then it is a proof validator not a theorem prover For instance a priori and posterior data to validate observations not to prove particular theories 5 Retrieved from Scientific American.com 2001 The Ontological Lifecycle The development of ontology follows a priori planning in iterative development It is inherently a common way to propagate the knowledge gained in various fields without having to reinvent the wheel There reuse in ontological engineering fusion/merging and composition/integration 5 In fusion re-use the ontology is built by bringing together knowledge from different new associations In his stack of specifications Berners-Lee talks about three stages of evolution in the identifiers which can be received and integrated to on binary vector string data for instance IFFN sensors Indeed the profile of missions is increasingly complicated with multi-objective multi-source data that needs to be interwoven in context behavioral and directly measured features Secondly URI protocols enable roam from page to page to readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users."5 The Semantic web adds identification tags to information and then links them can discover data a complex C4ISR system Firstly it highlights the inadequacy of single sensor systems that might only call source data an automated agent sensor data should be validated using a combination of or the re-use is are built through assembling source modules from various subjects This is appropriate when ontologies have gone through extensive modification adaptation or specialization over time 5 Discrimination Anti Submarine Warfare Categories ASW Mission Directly  Acoustic signatures Measured Features  Magnetic signatures  Diesel fume spectra  Bio-nuclear effects Behavioral  Speed Characteristics  Sustained speed  Depth  Maneuverability  Hostile act Context Information  Origin of mission  Location relative to friendly vessels 


Lucien Wald 8 has developed terms of reference in data fusion that can be repurposed toward various fusion ontologies Wald derives most of his terms from the remote sensing and defense system applications but we will demonstrate their extension to other fields through domain goal-based and mathematical reasoning The ObjectProcess Diagram OPD is an explicit representation of the semantic decomposition of these terms for generalized fusion Its overarching premise is the treatment and origins of raw information which can take several forms from measurement and signal to observations and verbal reports The relational links that constitute the OPD is given in Figure 3-2 Figure 3-2 Relational links in OPD 0 sa is the same as A code surrogate address of symbol for Decomposes to aggregates to i.k is characterized by exhibits A eSpecializes to generalizes to i instantiated to belongs to the class of Although fusion is the central process in Figure 3-3 it is helpful to include aspects of the supporting system as well as supporting processes which act on the information It is worth noting that there are many types of raw information which can be refined over various processes and environments The hardware elements of the supporting system have been simplified to represent a simple sensor arrangement In reality complex fusion systems are comprised of multiple distributed platforms with thousands of apertures and waveforms Similarly there are many more supporting processes which enable data fusion these hierarchical classification schemes will be discussed later Figure 3-3 Object-Process Diagram for Information Fusion Parallelism and other Taxonomies Rule-based analytics in knowledge-based systems KBS have benefited tremendously from the advent of parallel computers For instance the rules highlighted in Figure 34 under supporting processes can be subjected to rule-level partitioning where classes such as correlation combination or association rules are generated Class-based rule partitioning forms another aspect of ontology development namely one based on fusion algorithm Whereas the Object-Process Diagram above took an information-based approach to ontology design the class methods utilize a hierarchical scheme which imparts a specific decompositional logic or organization Hall develops taxonomy for level 1 processing that is extensible to other levels of fusion This is derived from algorithmsboth statistical and heuristicwhich are based on level 1 fusion object identification Level 1 is specialized into 3 classes positional identity and ancillary support algorithms These are further decomposed by technique or method Positional fusion for instance involves parametric association and estimation of data Identity fusion uses physical models cognitive models and feature-based inference Ancillary support systems which often comprise more than 80 of the fusion effort include numerical libraries data alignment preprocessing database management and man/machine interfaces These are only one instance of a larger class of items 6

p is a polarity or truth-value Real and abstract situations can be distinguished by their polarity A real situation is a set of facts with polarity equal to 1 10 Figure 4-1 illustrates Bowman's cognitive model for a perceptual reasoning machine PRM based on the concept of reinforcement learning Figure 4-1 Perceptual Reasoning Machine PRM for Cognition  Situational Awareness Reinforcement Perceptual Reasoning Cycle each sensor's signal is specific to the transducer design Since discrimination among targets occurs locally before data entry it reduces the load on the fusion processor 2 The next step in concept selection is known as the downselect phase During down-select potential applications are screened according to their fit with the JDL processing criteria This method was developed by Stuart Pugh in the 1980's and helps design teams to decide on optimal strategies for their product goals A Pugh concept selection matrix is provided in the Appendix It ranks applications based on the processing requirements of the data Tracker-Correlator Architectures There are currently 3 general synthetic architectures for data processing which exist today centralized decentralized autonomous and hybrid architectures Refer to Figures 42 through 4-4 11 Figure 4-2 Centralized Fusion Architecture A CENTRALIZED FUSION I Decliralonri The advanced combat direction system ACDS is an example of the centralized fusion architecture 9 The system has external interfaces with existing sensors which maintain different reporting protocols and data links Acoustic IFF ESM and Radar send sensor-level tracks and target reports to the track management processor indicated by the dashed line in Figure 4-2 These reports are fed into the ACDS database which contains tactical status intelligence maps doctrine and tracks Each track-to-track association or identification from the arrival of new observations requires retrieval of the data from a central decision support processor not shown The common thread underlying these location-driven architectures is the notion of a progressive data flow from sensor set A B N through detection classification and end-state Under the centralized scheme the preprocessed output is collected into the data alignment  association through coordination transformation Raw data from a multi-target environment is correlated and then transmitted to the central processing facility A variant of this type of fusion is centralized fusion of feature vector data This construct drives ambiguity out of the system by extracting feature vectors from an image The feature-based method is 8 enarS t Constols The closed loop PRM provides situational feedback to a human perceptual system which optimizes the decisionmaking process This is viewed as a meta-level information management system for resource control that continuously updates domain knowledge as it is acquired Process Selection Comparing Fusion Levels The table in the Appendix sets forth criteria that can be used in selecting a fusion level for a given application These characteristics form part of the selection process that can be used in screening for an appropriate concept The table is divided among four levels of data that approximately correspond to the JDL fusion levels The criteria are based on the type of sensory information being generated individual signals images features etc The table goes on to characterize the content of such information The degree and means of registration are also important factors as the spatial position of sensors determines their ultimate footprint and target-detection space Overlapping footprints ensure that time-dependent phenomena such as a target motion are observed by all sensors at the same time The criteria in Table A can then be used to select the type of architecture which factor into the fusion system design i.e central or sensor-level processing The main difference between these two is that the former processes sensor reports directly and in one place requiring a more complex fusion processor This helps to achieve better accuracy when the multi-sensor data is not generated by independent phenomena Sensor-level fusion is preferred when the signatures are independent There is more cueing of sensors with others in the suite where the optimization of NIIyotk*wwufic  im n

they are a useful construct for exploratory research and incremental development of a problem Finally hierarchical decompositions help deal with the problem of complexity in mission design by reducing the number of activities through progressive levels of detail Objectoriented representations in action decomposition are stored in plan librariesor databasesthat can be accessed to fit the needs of the mission However hierarchical methods such as blackboard architectures do not always decompose problems correctly In artificial intelligence Al the inability to capture everything in a set of logical rules is known as the qualification problem 13 Consequently blackboard architectures can be expensive to build modify and operate 5 APPLICATIONS Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence Surveillance  Reconnaissance systems C4ISR provide mature highly evolved examples of data fusion but they are not the only systems which make use of data fusion concepts The objective of a C4ISR system is to provide a comprehensive view of the tactical and strategic battle space through a variety of technologyand intelligence-based media The systems are composed of software hardware and human elements which work in concert to support decision-making processes Fulfillment of C4ISR objectives draws heavily on the utilization of sensor data Increasingly fusion design needs to account for the transition from platform-based systems to networkcentric operations Sense  Respond Logistics SRL Sense  Respond is an emerging domain in military and commercial logistics with powerful implications for the fusion paradigm It is a managerial framework that was originally proposed by researchers at IBM 13 based on the dynamic of change in business security and technology It is comprised of a value net of self-synchronizing partnerships which form and dissolve to adapt to demands in the environment Elements of this value net have been evolved specifically the triumvirate known as operational logistics and intelligence command for military and defense scenarios SRL almost mirrors the data fusion process itself by observing patterns detecting issues and performing root-cause analysis Finally data fusion in robotics plays an important role in factory automation processes such as material handling part fabrication and assembly This can appear in the form of cooperative systems dexterous hands and tele-operation for mining and manufacturing Biometrics Biometrics offers interesting case applications of data fusion principles Biometrics are used in the security or identification sectors where the systems draws on an attribute database to make comparisons and declarations about ownership or identity This is characterized by a subset of the processes used in the JDL model of data fusion object identification collection collation and evaluation The final stage of processing uses relatively simple decision rules to either accept or reject the user based on the attribute data on record Space Expeditions The Haughton-Mars expedition to the Canadian Arctic conducted by MIT in 2005 synthesizes some of these and other considerations in a complex data fusion system design Among other objectives the team set out to determine the efficacy of RFID technology for intelligent agent and asset tracking in support of exploration logistics 14 The International Space Station ISS is currently dominated by manual tracking and barcodes so the hypothesis was that automated web-accessible systems could offer potential savings in time and effort for inventory management Though the concept of RFID tagging was simple it led to complications with respect to optimal antenna installation and tracking of liquids and metallic items The system was equipped with both passive battery-run and active tagging leading to interference in the 915 MHz and 2450 MHz bands This implied that the range data could be reliable under more powerful strictly active RF sensors This would of course require the proper level of EMI shielding of the agents containers and ATVs being tracked In a separate part of the experiment the team developed functional Class of Supply COS ontologies to supplement the Cargo Category Allocations Rates Table CCART used by NASA as well as supply classifications used by NATO and the US Military This was borne out of the need to capture all major items for the new space exploration initiative not already listed in the CCART such as categories for propellant fuels and surface transportation vehicles needed for remote science stations Dynamically indexing these remote logistics categories to a generic upper level ontology that is web-enabled could vastly improve the tracking operation The sensor data being fused could help teams to not only make operational adjustments to the expedition for instance regarding ATV usage but also improve the quality and relevance of the experiments For instance an asset library that is hyperlinked to the web could inform agents of similar expeditions with results/findings openly accessible to the participants Semantic web links would ensure that there is no violation in naming conventions as new logistics applications are discovered Connectionist architectures 10

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
