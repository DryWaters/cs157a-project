the contextualized NETMARK[1 eXtensible DataBase XDB this search interface automatically infers categories for facets and allows users to select one or more category for each facet to narrow the results to only display those that meet all of the selected facet categories TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 APPROACH 5 3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  6 4 RESULTS 6 4 CONCLUSION 7 5 BIOGRAPHIES 8 6 REFERENCES 8 1 INTRODUCTION The immense success of commercial search systems such as those deployed at Google 
Amazon eBay and other top-tier search and commerce sites illustrate the demand from endusers for convenient and expedient access to the relevant information or products the user seeks Naive and sophisticated users of search systems today demand a simple easy-to-use search mechanism within which they can type in words identifiers or phrases of interest and the results are presented with the least amount of effort by the user These users expect relevant results and the ability to iteratively fine-tune their results usually by adding more terms to the 
search phrase Search Context Generalized search systems for searching multiple Internet or Intranet sites are generally limited in their ability to control the context of their search based upon fragments of the URL addressing space such as host name and path of the pages indexed This capability is particularly powerful 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright 2IEEEAC paper 1091 Version 2 Updated 2007:10:20 for users familiar with a subset of web sites that contain the information most relevant 
to them and most likely to address the questions asked through search Additional document contexts are often available depending on the types of systems indexed For example map systems can be searched on geographical or data set contexts message boards can be searched on author date or other relevant metadata For search systems that do not have a-priori knowledge of the structure and metadata of the data they are indexing they are unable to retrieve results based on more refined contexts For example searching the Internet for Christopher 
D Knight will return a large number of results but if the user was interested in papers on which Mr Knight were the author and the user was able to limit the search to the Authors section of documents it would significantly narrow the number of results to a more manageable and relevant set Leveraging additional contexts such as site say IEEE sites would increasingly target the results for further accuracy Incremental Refinement of Search While sophisticated users may already have preconceived contexts for 
their searches most users find complex grammars or user interfaces to be a barrier to use of the search system Instead this paper proposes an incremental refinement approach wherein the user performs a simple keyword search across all contexts and post search refines the results to narrow them to a smaller relevant set Incremental refinement has additional benefits the user may want to explore the larger space of results and may find results that are relevant but not necessarily in the contexts the user expected Or the user 
may not know the context\(s until they perform the initial search Sophisticated experienced users if given the choice to narrow the search before exploring may miss relevant results Using the previous example if a sophisticated user were able to limit the search to the Authors section of IEEE papers that user would not be aware of the instances where Mr Knight appears in the references section of the papers or that Mr Knight has a patent with the USPTO on a technology relevant to the user's interests 1

Figure 2 Current PVCS Search User Interface As illustrated in Figure 2 the existing PVCS web-based search interface is time-consuming to use and restrictive users seeking all records regarding a particular ISS subsystem or component and must perform a large number of search operations to answer a simple question such as What problems have been reported and resolved regarding GPS software Searching each set of PVCS records requires multiple user operations in a complex query interface This search interface requires selecting one database such as SCR and one or at most two fields such as the title or owner All records are presented as HTML tables for viewing with references to related records provided in the HTML tables as links NETMARK Search System Developed by a team in the Intelligent Systems Division of the NASA Ames Research Center the NETMARK system provides an environment for data integration across multiple disparate and heterogeneous repositories NETMARK combines the capability to ingest a variety of data in unstructured semi-structured and highly-structured forms with the ability to search the NETMARK index and retrieve information atoms via a rich while straightforward query language Data is integrated in NETMARK eXtensible DataBase NETMARK XDB with no a-priori knowledge of the structure and with no NETMARK configuration required It is common however to massage the data being loaded into NETMARK for increase precision of retrievals For example unstructured text Word documents HTML documents and XML documents may be loaded into NETMARK XDB directly However semantic information about the relationship between sections of text is often not explicit in less-structured formats such as HTML i.e in HTML tables As part of the NETMARK deployment Ames developed a web crawling system that automatically retrieves updated PVCS records via the web interface normalizes the table-heavy HTML into an XML structure and loads the XML into the NETMARK database Data is loaded into NETMARK XDB via the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning WebDAV[5 protocol a file-sharing protocol built on top of the HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP As files are transferred to the NETMARK XDB system they are automatically decomposed and indexed with a full-text index system and immediately available for querying and document fragment retrieval by clients and users Interacting with the NETMARK schema-less database system is performed by executing simple or compound searches using a specific grammar of context  content requests i.e searching for the content Knight under a context with Authors will produce a result set containing this and other papers where the name Knight appears in the Authors section of those documents Searches in NETMARK XDB can be as simple as a content-only search returns any context with the terms sought in the content section or compound with multiple contexts and contents 3

SCFWR 3  JlSP N The application of the NETMARK model to ISS mission operations has been an on-going project for many years and a variety of user interface prototypes have been developed These previous interfaces required the user to select a context for their search similar to the PVCS system but more powerful in that the search operation would be performed across multiple record types simultaneously For example the previous system would allow users to select the title or description context using a pull-down form element and provide search terms in a text box Documents containing the search terms in the context specified were returned However even sophisticated users were confused by the user interface when it asked to both provide a search string and pre-select a context in the case of data replicated from PVCS record field name Also of concern to the developers while it would have been possible to allow the the need to simplify and provide the bare minimum required to perform the work This simplified user interface produces a set of results in a paginated view for the client to browse through and to review individual results in detail Links to the data record in the authoritative system of record are provided for each search result akin to the links in common search service results such as Google but an expandable display of results is also available for immediate viewing In developing this simplified user interface it became apparent that the contexts of the resulting contents were available at no cost By using the NETMARK XDB system all searches produce the associated contexts for the contents found The contexts of all of the results are compiled and presented to the end-user in a faceted user interface for further refinement Each result is shown as one line of text N umber of rsulsR 44 T*pe  US  16743 13202  19178  12860 Resu taPgel20 Status CLOSED CLOSE CLOSED CLOSED NO ACTION REQUIRED NO v SCR SR A O1N RQU1RE CLOSACEDNRQS NOACTION REQU RED CLOSED CLOE NO ACTIONREQURE CL0SED NO.ACTON.REQUIRED Figure 4 NX Search Facet Ut user to select all contexts habit and familiarity with the PVCS search system would lead users to select the contexts they felt were most likely to return results and records that may be of interest may be overlooked 2 APPROACH The first approach to addressing ease of use was to provide a simple user interface with a single text input field and perform a content-only search of the database with the words and phrases provided Repeated requests from users to make the interface as easy to use as Google reinforced but a small triangle button expands one record's display showing all of the fields recorded in NETMARK for quick review A link to the record in PVCS is also provided so that the system of record is consulted and so that users may navigate to related records in a manner familiar to regular users of PVCS Users of this system are presented with a simple search form wherein they select the type\(s of records they wish to search and a free-text field for providing terms and phrases of interest Screenshots of the user interface pages are shown in Figures 4 and 5 5  M iNON l2 E mg E  f.l  e ASCS APF ROVED 0 lN"2 NE Rela2te  sear}fches Type R SCR  SCR SR SR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR SCR In SCR F SPN N F SI G FCOH Pag X 2 ID Tite 18 92 12326 1  K..K    K  K%,t8     _ _KK..............KKKK  EIferSSuu _SSSS.X.X.X.=UUUU UUU _S.._S 1   A f,jl I f W

 Individual results may belong to more than one category under a given facet e.g if the user searched for Knight and it appeared in both the Author and Bio sections of a document that document would belong to both categories As facets and their categories are non-hierarchical and as records may belong to more than one facet the UI allows users to select multiple facet categories and they are presented with all records that belong to any of those facets Other faceted UI's rely on facet categories being hierarchical and only allow users to select an individual category under each facet  Interactions with the faceted UI are performed purely client-side for high performance The authors are unaware of any faceted user interfaces that are performed purely on the client and that provide the immediate feedback and high performance inherent in this implementation The user interface has presented some challenges and have remaining open questions including  How to handle user selections When all categories for a facet are selected and the user selects one category should all other categories be de-selected or the one selected  What numerical value to display next to each facet category current implementation shows the total number of records in that facet category but this value may be confusing when one facet has multiple categories turned off  How to handle very long facet category lists currently the lists are unordered but even when they are ordered users may seek the categories with fewest results or with the most results 4 CONCLUSION The NETMARK XDB Faceted Search user interface will continue to be improved based upon feedback provided by end-users The techniques and layout will be leveraged for other applications at NASA and other agencies It is applicable to systems that leverage the XDB server technology and semi-structured contextualized nature of the query results produced Further developments include evaluating how best to combine less-structured documents with more structured data sets such as the PVCS records They also include leveraging ontologies and taxonomies to organize and unify the display in a more logical and userfriendly fashion The technique may be easily applied to any search system that uses generated metadata to provide views of the information to be retrieved 7

The equation uses the variable L1 for the longitude where the horizon mask crosses \226   L sin 0 0       212     212 002 else 0 1 1 1  xy 212 005  t 004   004 L  DTE L  002   t  005  002 212  Hp d R     7  Comparing these theoretical e quations with the computed illumination and DTE communications averages required using an adjusted lunar reference altitude at the poles.  The lunar reference geoid radius of 1738 km is not a good average value for the terrain at either pole.  The lunar south pole is part of the Aitken Basin, and the GSSR Digital Elevation Model elevations ha ve an average of -1880 m within 200 km of the south pole.  The lunar north pole region has an average elevation of -1673 m within 150 km of the north pole.  These averag es were subtracted from base site reference altitude to get the value of \221h\222 used in equation 2.  This effectively gaves the base sites a higher elevation relative to the local average elevation  For selected base sites, solar illumination and DTE communications averages were computed for tower heights from 2 m to 1500 m, and in some cases 3000 m.  Then these tower heights plus adjusted altitudes and base locations were used in equations 1 through 7 to get predicted values of the yearly average metrics.  The results are shown in figures 14 and 15.  Figure 14 shows black curves of equation 5 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  For the selected sites, the computed yearly average solar illumination is shown by squares, connected by a dashed line with the theoretical yearly average for the same location and tower heights The theoretical values are marked with X\222s.  South lunar Pole sites are in blue and the lunar north pole sites are in red.  The plots show reasonable agreement of computed values and theory, with the computed value never exceeding the theoretical.   Figure 15 shows black curves of equation 7 plotted parametrically with distance from the pole.  Th e value of L0 was set to zero for the parametric curves.  Fi gure 15 include computed and theoretical values of the yearly average DTE communications for the same sites as figure 14, using the same symbol and color conventions  At no site will a tower of 1500 m or less provide both 100 average yearly solar illumination and 100% average DTE communications.  Towers of 1500 m at sites NB and NC will raise the average yearly solar illumination to 100 But for the lunar south pole sites, like B1, towers of over 2500 m are required to rais e the average yearly solar illumination to 100%.  This is because the peaks Malapert 002 peaks  t\002 1  212  0 1 4 R      6  The yearly average Earth co mmunications, DTE, is then given by the equation        L L  L L Hm R  8  The obscuring effect of these p eaks is also shown in figure 5, where the peak Malapert t 006 002    L  2 cos 180 abs 180 sin 006 212 003 003  002 latitude These variables are   003  and Leibnitz 002 obscure the view of the sun from the lunar south pole.  Equation 8 gives the elevation, Hp, above a spherical surface needed to see the winter sun over a peak of elevation Hm at a distance, d from the pole.  Equation 8 provided values in Figures 4 and 14 for the Malapert 003 and Leibnitz 212 003 is at +10 degrees azimuth  Figure 15 shows the yearly average DTE communication varies more with distance fr om the pole toward the prime meridian that with tower height above the local terrain Towers up to 3000 m at the poles do not make significant improvements in the DTE co mmunications average.  The computed yearly average DT E communications for site NG exceed the predicted values fo r towers between 32 and 1500 meters tall.  This is because the view northward from site NG toward the Earth looks across the floor of Byrd Crater which averages about -2500 m elevation  Considerations for Photovoltaic Array Design  The lunar pole sites create some difficult challenges for designing a continuously operating photovoltaic power system.  A site with continuous solar illumination will see the Sun travel through 360 degrees of azimuth during 1 synodic month.  A photovoltaic power system would require several permanently mounted photovoltaic arrays pointed in several directions, or would have to continually track the Sun with a single array.  Sin ce a single array requires much less mass, the design of the solar tracking system is examined here  The requirement to continually track the Sun could be met by installing the photovoltaic array on a vertical axle oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis.  At the lunar south pole, this axle would rotate counterclockwise with the Sun to keep the array normal to the solar radiation.  This requires a foundation to support the axle cross beam structures to hold the array on the axle, and a drive system to turn the array.  This system also requires a solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem, in order to continually track the Sun.  After 1 synodic month the array has turned through 360 degrees and needs to continue rotating in the same direction.  Power and control cables from the array need to go through multiple slip rings, or the array needs to rotate 360 degrees clockwise to unwrap the cables.  A slip ring design is further complicated by the requirement to tolerate the fine dust on    arccos 004  005  b t cos if 


  10 the lunar surface.  Using the \221cable unwrap\222 method means stopping power production for a short amount of time, once per synodic month  A heliostat design using a focusing mirror may provide a low-mass solution to the \221cable wrap\222 problem [Ref 10   Figure 16 shows a photovoltaic array installed horizontal to the local terrain.  A parabolic section mirror is installed above the array, angled at approximately 45 degrees to the local horizontal.  This mirror is suspended from the crossbar of a mast placed next to the array.  The mast could also be the structure for the Lunar Co mmunications Terminal \(LCT antennas.  The mirror is suspe nded from an axle that is oriented parallel to the lunar spin axis and rotates once per synodic month to continually reflect solar radiation onto the array.  The mirror can continue to track after 360 degrees revolution, since there are no cables attached to the moving part.  This heliostat \221periscope\222 design provides continuous solar tracking, but is partially shaded once per revolution when the Sun passes behind the support mast  Shaping the mirror into a para bolic arc concentrates solar power for a small increase in mass.  The tradeoffs should consider the relative mass-perunit area of the mirror and the photovoltaic panels, the reflectivity of the mirror material and the relative masses of an array-support axle versus a mirror heliostat axle plus mast  Additional flat \221periscope\222 mirrors mounted on the crossbar could be used to direct solar light to areas nearby.  This provides an efficient method of lighting work areas because it bypasses the inefficiencies of the photovoltaic system battery storage, and electric lighting.  If the photovoltaic power system is located on a crat er rim \(as in Figure 16\a flat \221periscope\222 mirror could provide continuous lighting to exploration crews in the perman ently shadowed areas within the crater.  Sufficiently large heliostat mirrors could redirect enough sunlight to run photovoltaic arrays at remote locations.  This would provide very efficient power transfer for operating within the permanently shaded areas  5  C ONCLUSIONS   Separating the lunar pole solar illumination problem into terrain horizon mask and solar motion computations simplified the production of illumination metrics.  Using a simplified model of average solar motion allowed quick comparisons between lunar south pole sites.  The results show that within 100 km of the lunar south pole, solar illumination is maximized at previously identified site locations.  These sites are small areas on the peaks of isolated mountains and crater rims.  No site provides 100 yearly average for both solar illumination and DTE communication.  Lunar north pole sites were also examined No site at either pole prov ides 100% yearly average for solar illumination unless a tower at least 1500 m is placed on one of the best lunar north pole sites  The best lunar south pole sites are on the rim of Shackleton crater, and the ridge west of Sh ackleton crater.  These 3 sites have yearly average of solar illumination between 93 and 97%.  The Sites have 100% solar power generation capability about 85 to 92% of the year.  For both of these metrics, Site B1 on the ridge West of Shackleton crater has the highest solar illumination values.  Site B1 has direct-toEarth visibility of the entire Earth disk about 51% of each month.  More detailed analysis of site B1 can use the terrain horizon masks presented here, coupled with more detailed true-of-date solar motion computations  Examination of the site solar illumination profiles at 40meter resolution shows the peaks of illumination are distributed over many points.  The locations with greater than 80% solar illumination are spread over 100s of meters This supports the conclusion that the Digital Elevation Model has adequate sampling to show the true terrain characteristics  The lunar north pole base sites NB and NC have yearly average solar illumination around 97%, and have 100 solar power generation capability about 88 to 92% of the time for the average year  The yearly average for 100% DTE communications at the best lunar north pole and south pole sites are all around 50%.  The yearly average DTE communications does not vary significantly with tower height, but does increase to 100% for sites about 100 km from the poles toward the lunar prime meridian 6  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  The author expresses thanks to Martin A.
