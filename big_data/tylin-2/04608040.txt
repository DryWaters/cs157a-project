An Interactive Mobile Amphibious Probing and Surveillance System   Ying Tang  Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ 08028  Email tang@rowan.edu  Hong Zhang Dept. of Mechanical Engineering Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ 08028 Email  zhang@rowan.edu    Abstract Ecological studies of shallow water and wetland habitats are often hindered by difficulty accessing remote sites Current methods of data acquisition, are either lack of the flexibility that is critical to characterizing conditions or organisms in dynamic habitats \(such as physical sampling mounting sensors in the field\, or too big and expensive to work in shallow water or wetland habitats \(such as Remotely Operated Vehicles, and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles\. This paper presents an original robotic design to cover shallow-water and difficult terrain with amphibious capabilities and a selfadjustable sensor holder with camera for enhanced underwater testing, called Interactive Mobile Amphibious Probing and Surveillance System. Experimental results show that the system is highly efficient and is ready to perform many demanding tasks in various water and weather conditions   Index Terms Ö Amphibious robot, Mobile robot, Shallow water  I  I NTRODUCTION  Shallow water and wetland habitats are among the most productive and ecologically significant habitats in nature Their intrinsic ecological and economic value and the pervasive threats to these habitats place a premium on scientific research that examines their functioning interconnections, and their role in regional and global ecosystems. However, current methods of data acquisition in shallow-water and wetland habitats are ill suited for capturing data continuously in time and space. For example, manual sampling by workers in the field o r c o n t i nuo us m o n i t o r i n g  at permanent installations [1, 2  a r e s e n s i tiv e to lo g i s tic al conditions \(e.g. season, weather, terrain, a ccess\, can be expensive, and lack of flexibility that is critical to characterizing conditions or organisms in dynamic habitats Although existing mobile sensor platforms such as Remotely Operated Vehicles \(ROV\ and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles \(AUV\ are capable of dynamic remote data collection, they are often designed for use in the deep environs of the open ocean such that their size and limited agility are not suitable for work in shallow water or wetland habitats [3    Motivated by these remarks, we design and build an Interactive Mobile Amphibious Probing & Surveillance System \(IMAPS 2 that extends our ability to autonomously sample in shallow water or complex terrain. Since it is small in size, powerful in computing, flexible on sensors, and manoeuvrable in the field, our design presented in the paper enables educators and researchers to conduct field tests and surveys with minimal disturbance The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the IMAPS 2 design. Section 3 presents its experiments and applications, followed by our conclusion and future directions in Section 4 II  DESIGN OF IMAPS 2  IMAPS 2 is a mobile amphibious robot that is designed with the following goals 1  Modular and scalable design The design should minimize the effort required to reconfigure sensors electronics, and control systems. The entire design is partitioned into several subsystems that are easy to upgrade with usersê input, which has no or little impact on others 2  Small size and portability The vehicle should be light enough to be handled by just one person and small enough to be easily put into the back of a midsized SUV or minivan. Therefore, no special equipment or vehicle will be required to use the r obot 3  Minimum maintenance The susceptibility to corrosion and electronic faults should be minimized. The internal equipment \(e.g., camera, sensors, and computer\ should be protected 4  Long operation time The robot should be able to operate in water for at least four hours, enough for a regular morning or afternoon session. Extra battery pack can be added or replaced for longer time without affecting the performance of the robot itself 5  Flexibility For different tasks or applications, the robot should be able to work on different kinds of water bodies. Its operating system should also be open to accept and adapt to multiple control algorithms Following the above key characters, the IMAPS 2 is designed using host-agent approach. The host is a high-end computer that stores and displays the data transmitted from the agent. It receives instructions from an operator and sends control signals to the agent. Fig.1 shows the block diagram of the land-based host. The agent is a tele-operated vehicle commanded by the host. It navigates in the field, collects data and transmits the information back to the host For easy configuration, the design of the agent robot is partitioned into several modules: \(1\ actuating module, \(2 winch module, \(3\ computation module, \(4\ and bio-data collection module. As shown in Fig. 2, all these modules are controlled by an onboard computer Mini-ITX   f o r  concerted operations 978-1-4244-2184-8/08/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE 441 Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation June 20 -23, 2008, Zhangjiajie, China 


 Figure 1: Block diagram of the land-based host      Figure 2: Block diagram of the agent   The rest of the section focuses on the mechanical structure, modular design, and software implementation of the agent robot  A  Structure Design The agent is a pontoon-style double-hulled boat as shown in Fig. 3. It is stable on moderate waves and also provides enough buoyancy to carry the onboard equipment. The boat is propelled by two thrusters on the back to achieve 2 m/s at steady state on calm water. In order to obtain maneuverability on soft land such as mud or sand, a pair of all-terrain rubber tank tracks is installed on the bottom. They are powered separately but controlled concurrently with the propellers. The combined effort of propellers and tracks enables the agent to easily move on complex terrain, such as marshes, beaches bay, rivers, and creeks Considering that the hull itself has to be both lightweight and substantially strong to endure the extra abuse associated with amphibious operation, we choose a frame-based hull design with independent water tight compartments. As shown in Figure 4, the left and right compartments provide the most buoyancy and supporting force for the robot. The center frame includes a water-tight cell to host the computer and other onboard electronics and a strengthened structure to carry the winch module. The frame is made from 1é aluminum Lchannel with a thickness of 1/16é. It is covered by 1/4é luan plywood with fiberglass coating. The center cell is covered by 1/4é lexan polycarbonate to provide transparency to the onboard forward looking and downward looking cameras   Figure 3: A computer rendering of the IMAPS2 agent         Figure 4: The skeleton of the agent  B  Actuating Module  To navigate the robot, two 550 size çstingeré motors as shown in Fig. 5 are used on each propeller mounted in the rear of the side compartment  Figure 5: Electric motors used on each propeller  In view of powerful maneuverability needed for the agent on soft terrain, a pair of tank tracks is added on top of two propellers. The idlers are hollow and filled with foams to offset most of the extra weight brought by the treads and their frames. Please see Figure 6. Due to the higher torque requirement, the tracks use separate electric motors and speed reducers from the propellers  442 


 Figure 6: Thread design  The electric DC motors are controlled by their individual digital speed controllers \(DSC\. Each DSC in turn is wired to the on-board computer, which give the commands to change the speed of the motors. A force sensor on the track frame gives the system a feedback whether the robot is fully buoyant on water, or riding on the land, or somewhere in between Then the computer will turn on or off the motors accordingly Meanwhile, differential control is used to set the speed of individual motors. So the robot can achieve complex maneuvers  C  Sensor Module  Two sets of sensors are mounted on the agent. One set is fixed onboard that will be discussed in the next session. The other set is a removable sensor package \(multi-purpose water quality sensor, a high quality underwater camera, a remotelyoperated water sample collector\ that can be exchanged for different projects. The one used in our prototype is Sonde from YSI, a multi-parameter spot sampling device with fieldreplaceable sensors [6  F i n a l l y  th e s e n s o r s  ar e p l a ced in a sensor holder There are two possible driving conditions for the agent On land or in very shallow water, the tracks of the boat will touch the bottom as shown in Fig. 7; in this case, the sensor holder will be lifted such that only the tip or the reacting parts of the sensors are immersed in water. Both the propellers and tracks will be powered on to provide sufficient driving force      Figure 7:IMAPS 2 crawls along the combination of land and very shallow water while the tip of the sensor is in water  When the water is deep enough to keep the boat fully afloat, the agent will be driven like a regular surface vehicle and the sensor holder will be lowered down into the water to the desired depth and orientation as shown in Fig. 8 To fulfill these functions, four propellers are added to place the sensors in a particular position and orientation while a camera, a light, and a pressure sensor provide some basic feedback for more accurate placement. In particular, a built-in sonar depth finder in the computation module provides instantaneous depth of the water column at the location of the agent, while the pressure sensor on the sensor holder gives the depth of the sensor below the surface. This ability to measure depth two ways helps prevent the sensors from making contact with the bottom of the water body, which could result in damage to the sensors; the ability to maneuver the sensor holder with the propellers helps to orient the sensors and also to prevent them from touching the bottom Figure  shows the structure of the self-propelled sensor holder           Figure 8:IMAPS 2 cruises on the surface of the water while the sensor holder \(with sensors\ is lowered into the water             Figure 9: The self-propelled sensor holder with Sonde installed  D  Computation Module  To accurately position and navigate the agent robot, a set of sensors is equipped onboard, including a compass, a GPS unit, and a depth finder.  The digital compass is used to detect the robot orientation. The heading information is provided to control algorithms to adjust thruster powers. With a digital GPS, the precise location of the robot can be obtained to deploy the robot in known sampling locations. As stated early the depth finder, together with the pressure sensor in the sensor holder, can deploy the sensors at desired depths to collect bio data. In addition, two on-board video cameras, one forward-oriented and the other downward-oriented are mounted to visually monitor the field condition and provide visual feedback to the operator in manual control mode  E  Software Design  Sonde Sonde holder Propeller Camera Connector Pressure Sensor Light 443 


For the convenience of operating the robot, an easy-to-use graphical user interface \(GUI\ with two panels is developed As depicted in Figs. 10 and 11, the right panel allows users to choose either manual control or autonomous control of the field agent, and the left panel displays the GPS, depth, and bio-sensor readings   Figure 10: GUI of the IMAPS 2 in Manual Control   Figure 11: GUI of the IMAPS 2 in autonomous control Under manual control, operating the left/right motor turns the robot right/left. With the same speed for both motors, the robot goes straightly forward or backward. The Sync Motors button is also designed to ease this process. The Up and Down buttons with the water and Sonde depths shown on the left panel are to raise or lower the Sonde without touching the bottom of the water body With the autonomous control where the PID control algorithm is currently deployed, users can send the robot to a particular GPS point or multiple points by manual entry of desired GPS stations in the top and bottom dialog boxes. Note that several other control algorithms are under development to be integrated into the software By default, the robot is set to be 50% power. With different proficient level of the users, the maximum power can be set at anywhere between 0 to 100% in the setting mode as shown in Fig. 12. In addition, users can set autonomous threshold distance, indicating the radius of how close the robot needs to be to the destination. Considering the current of water, this function of dynamic anchoring is necessary since the robot will never be at the exact point   Figure 12: GUI of the IMAPS 2 in setting mode  III  EXPERIMENTS  We have conducted a number of experiments to demonstrate maneuverability of the IMAPS 2 and its applications. Fig. 13 shows the robot cruising on water to reach the testing point   Figure 13: An IMAPS 2 prototype in action  The autonomous navigation was first tested with a particular GPS coordinates and then with a set of waypoints. The IMAPS 2 successfully navigated itself to these coordinates within a preset distance.  As stated early, such preset distance was used to avoid the possibility of the GPS coordinates being read by the computer never equaling exactly the values given for the coordinates in the GUI.  The results of one of these tests can be seen plotted over a satellite image of the test site in Fig. 14, where the orientation of the robot is facing southwest at the starting point, and then facing the destination while gliding on the water surface to reach it Gusty wind and moving water are apparently the two most significant disturbances on the control Another series of experiments were performed to monitor characteristics of a given water body, such as pH, DO, and temperature, etc. Such data was then filtered and plotted in three dimensional space using Matlab. One set of test results are shown in Fig. 15, where the depth data was collected while the robot was moving along the given trajectory  444

A series of experimental results show that the IMAPS 2 is capable of autonomous navigation on a given water body and remote data acquisition of its aquatic habitat Future development will focus on advanced high-level control algorithms \(e.g., automatically seeking out the source of a pollutant by measuring the pollutant and identifying a concentration gradient, and navigating up-gradient\ to be integrated into this field-deployable unit, and large-scale field testing  A CKNOWLEDGMENT   This material is based upon the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0442861   R EFERENCES  1  B.

To include the effects of evidence uncertainty in the Bayesian analysis, we first had to define how to express evidence uncertainty. We enter a certainty  value for each state of the node. These state certainties are percentages and must sum to 100. For example, for a temperature node, we might enter certainties of: 80 for hot, 15 for warm, and 5 for cold This could be interpreted as saying I m 80 certain that the temperature is hot. I might be wrong but even if I am it is still more likely to be warm than cold say 15% for warm, and only 5% for cold. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to include the uncertain evidence by dithering the evidence during the Simulation according to the specified certainties For the temperature certainties given above, in a Monte Carlo simulation of say, 1000 cycles, we interpret this to mean that for 800 of the cycles temperature should be set to hot; for 150 cycles temperature = warm, and for 50 cycles temperature cold. When dithering more than one evidence node care must be taken not to induce correlations between the dithered nodes. This can be done by drawing a selector variable from a uniform distribution Another way to deal with uncertain evidence at modeling time is to place a noisy observer node below the real evidence node as its only child. The observer node represents a noisy sensor or an imperfect observer and its false positive and false negative rates can be entered into the observer s CPT With this mechanism, one can also account for other sensor effects such as detection attenuation due to the sensor being at some distance from the effect it is trying to observe. One then enters the evidence into the observer node rather than the real evidence node This could be done at run time by creating the observer node on the fly and inserting it into the BBN at run time. An area of research for us is the use of Bayesian likelihoods to express evidence uncertainty [6    6. Optimizing Evidence Collection  In rapid response situations where evidence must be obtained efficiently and quickly, and in situations where evidence is costly or difficult to obtain, it is important to optimize both the efficacy of the evidence and the method of collection \(if desired IKE provides first a sensitivity analysis, called evidence marshalling, to rank the best evidence to collect next. That ranking then feeds into an asset allocation optimization if desired To perform evidence marshalling in IKE, the analyst selects one or more hypothesis nodes and then runs evidence marshalling. The system will then rank order all the evidence nodes in terms of how much information gain each evidence node contributes to the group of selected hypothesis nodes Thus the system identifies the most influential evidence to collect next. In so doing, the system acknowledges the evidence currently set in the analysis, and calculates the information gains over the remaining unknown evidence nodes Like the IKE Analysis function, evidence marshalling uses Monte-Carlo to compute the variance of the results in this case the variance of the information gains. This variance is used in a utility function to penalize an evidence node if the variance of its information gain is relatively larger than that of another evidence node having nearly equal information gain, causing the node to rank lower Information gain is computed from entropy, a concept from thermodynamics. As a system becomes more disorganized its entropy increases and its information gain decreases. When applied to information theory, entropy and information gain are inverse measures of the influence one node has on another. We use a Netica method to calculate the information gain IG\(h:e\een a hypothesis node and each of the evidence nodes. When the user selects multiple hypothesis nodes h 1 h 2 h 3 to marshal over, we would have liked to compute the joint information gain IG\(h 1 h 2 h 3 e\ce Netica has no method for joint information gain, we approximate the desired result as avg[IG\(h 1 e h 2 e h 3 e  An area of research for us is to compute the joint information gain, and also to enhance this sensitivity analysis to find the evidence that best reduces uncertainty and that best discriminates between competing hypotheses For the analyst who has the ability to task assets to go collect evidence IKE has a capability to perform an optimal asset allocation based on the optimal list of  evidence nodes produced by evidence marshalling. Beforehand, one must make a mapping that identifies which assets can collect \(evidence for which evidence nodes. Then one adds asset characteristics like availability \(is the asset available cost \(how costly is the asset to use for collecting this evidence\meliness \(how quickly can this asset collect this evidence\nd risk \(how risky to collect this evidence\e then adds collection constraints find me an immediately available asset that can collect the evidence within 30 minutes at the lowest cost and risk\d turns this into an integer linear programming optimization problem \(a la operations analysis\which can be solved by a linear programming solver. IKE uses a freeware solver called LP SOLVE TM The result is a list of the best Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


assets with which to collect the optimal list of evidence  7. Determining Remaining Influence  Knowing when you have enough evidence to make a decision can be difficult. After obtaining some evidence, the IKE analysis might be pointing to a particular answer, and the uncertainty in that answer due to model parameter error and evidence uncertainty might even be small \(see figure below but might there not be another piece of remaining evidence that would overturn that answer if that evidence could be collected    Figure 9. Enough evidence for decision  One way to get a handle on this might be to run evidence marshalling and look at the remaining evidence nodes that rise to the top of the list. If their information gains are small, one might feel confident that remaining evidence will not greatly affect the current answer. However, the information gain scale has not yet been calibrated \(future research\nd marshalling uses it only in a relative way, so looking at the information gain values is not really helpful at this time IKE can produce a definitive answer to this quandary by performing an analysis of remaining influence Given the evidence already entered in the system, IKE generates all possible combinations of the remaining evidence findings. Then, on each cycle of the remaining influence simulation, it sets one possible remaining evidence combination into the BBN and accumulates results just as in the Monte Carlo simulation discussed previously. The simulation results are displayed in the same way, but now the interpretation is different. The data displayed has nothing to do with model parameter uncertainty or evidence uncertainty, but rather comes from the dithering of the remaining evidence through all possible combinations. For each node state the mean now represents the average state probability over all the remaining evidence which may not be very informative. But the standard deviation is informative it tells us how much variation in the answer is possible due to the influence of the remaining evidence. The max and min markers \(the red dots of figure 7\o informative especially the max The max marker records the maximum probability that occurred during the simulation. This implies that there was a remaining evidence combination that caused that maximum value. If a state having this max value would overturn the answer currently in the system, then this is the combination of remaining evidence that would do it. The figures below show two results from the remaining influence simulations The first result shows that the current answer will not be overturned hence enough evidence has been obtained for a decision. The second result shows that the current evidence is not sufficient for a decision but if the decision must be made anyway, at least there is some feeling for the alternatives    Figure 10. Current answer \(Penguin\ firm      Figure 11. Robin could overturn Penguin  8. Conclusions  The Integrated Knowledge Engine extends traditional Bayesian analysis by giving the modeler a way to express model parameter uncertainty at modeling time and by giving the analyst a way to express evidence uncertainty at run time. A Monte Carlo simulation wrapped around a traditional Bayesian analysis tool then allows these effects to be included in the results of the Bayesian inferencing IKE also provides enhancements to optimize the collection of evidence and to understand when enough evidence has been obtained for a solid decision, and if not, a better understanding of the alternatives. Each of these enhancements provides a needed mechanism for rapid response situations specifically to arrive at a solution as quickly as possible with the least uncertainty Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


The modeling process contributes a sharper focus on the right data, the evidence \(effects\that really stem from the causes of interest. The evidence marshalling optimization allows the analyst to focus on collecting and analyzing the right data at the right time and better deal with the overwhelming flows of data we encounter today Although IKE has been a mature capability for several years now, there are still several areas of research, as this is a work in progress. We would like to move towards more analytic methods of incorporating the uncertainty directly into the Bayesian analysis and move away from simulation However, due to the speed of Netica, we find that simulation performs quite well on fairly large models of several hundred nodes. We are also looking at a multivariate random distribution that is a bit more robust than our Dirichlet Mixture. Although uncertainty is considered in evidence marshalling, we will be extending its capability to drive down uncertainty and discriminate between competing hypotheses. Remaining influence analysis is a relatively new capability that will certainly be improved Currently, IKE is a stand-alone application. We are developing a web version of IKE so that teams of analysts can collaborate over the web,  each entering evidence in a joint analysis IKE is a National Lab capability.

gression model to incorporate them into one model Here we study how the three factors affect the prediction of helpfulness individually That is how would the model perform if we choose to use only one of the factors for prediction In Section 3 we discussed three models Equations 3 4 and 5 corresponding to the three factors For the experiments we train the three individual models as presented in Section 3 with the corresponding feature vectors and measure the accuracy of each one In particular we let k 1 3 and k 2 10 in this experiment and the results are shown in Table 2 Component MSE F-measure reviewer expertise 0.1912 0.5179 writing style 0.1937 0.2433 timeliness 0.1004 0.6482 all of the three 0.0332 0.7116 Table 2 Individual effects on prediction Apparently considering the timeliness factor only yields the best results in both MSE and F-measure among the three factors This coincides with our intuition that a timely review can be very helpful for customers to evaluate the product of interest Only considering the writing style gives the worst performance of the three implying that it has less predictive power compared with reviewer expertise and timeliness Note that the results obtained by considering only one factor are not as good as considering all the factors together 4.5 Comparison with alternative method To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model we compare it against a baseline model that use linear regression LR For each review we obtain the feature vectors  x  y t  corresponding to each factor in the same way as described in Section 3 and concatenate them together to form one vector r  Then the linear regression model can be written as  H l  003 T r  b where 006 is the coef\036cient vector and b is the intercept This model can be 036t to the training data using standard linear least squares method We conducted a series of experiments with different T values and compare the performance of the LR model with our proposed method As shown in Figure 7 it is clear that our proposed method is much more accurate than the LR model for both proli\036c and non-proli\036c reviewers 5 Related Work 5.1 Review mining With the rapid growth of online reviews automatic review mining has attracted a lot of research attention Early work in this area was primarily focused on determining the 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 T MSE   RBF Prolific Linear Prolific RBF Non\025pro Linear Non\025pro a MSE 10 15 20 25 30 35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 T F\025measure   RBF Prolific Linear Prolific RBF Non\025pro Linear Non\025pro b F-measure Figure 7 Comparison with linear regression model semantic orientation of reviews Among them some of the studies attempt to learn a positive/negative classi\036er at the document level 16 15 w h i l e ot hers w o rk at a 036 ner l e v el and use words as the classi\036cation subject 18  Pushing further from the explicit two-class classi\036cation problem Liu et al 7 b u ild a frame w o rk to compare c onsumer opinions of competing products using multiple feature dimensions Liu et al 11 a s s u me t h at s e nt i m ent consists of multiple hidden aspects and use a probability model to quantitatively measure the relationship between sentiment aspects and reviews Our method departs from classic review mining approaches in that ultimately we want to examine the importance of these opinions which is a new and important research problem In some sense  determining the sentiment and helpfulness of reviews a re orthogonal to each other and could be modeled independently One recent work that is closely related to our study attempts to examine the economic impact of the online reviews 5 That approach mainly focuses on quantifying the extent of which the textual content especially the subjectivity of each review affects product sales on a market such as Amazon while our method aims to build a more fundamental model for review helpfulness prediction Another relevant study in this 036eld analyzes spams that exist in online reviews 8  I n p a r ticular their work presents a categorization of review spams and proposes some novel strategies to detect different types

quality of Web documents has received a lot of attention particular ly because of its application to search engines PageRank and HITS are two popular link-based ranking algorithms to determine the importance of web pages 10 14 The H ITS a l gori t h m i s b as ed on the observation that a good hub usually points to good authorities and a good authority usually points to good hubs The Pagerank algorithm doesnít distinguish hub and authority pages Instead it estimates the importance of the web pageís neighbours and the authority of the page is considered proportional to this value Motivated by this idea various algorithms have been proposed to discover the authorities or leaders in the Web domain 9 17 13  Note that our approach is different from above methods in that we use semantic inform ation of web document rather than link structures for evaluating the helpfulness of online reviews 6 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have considered the important problem of predicting the helpfulness of reviews We provided a detailed analysis of the major factors affecting the helpfulness of a review and proposed a nonlinear model based on radial basis functions for helpfulness prediction Extensive experiments on the IMDB data set have con\036rmed the effectiveness of the proposed model Our study in this paper has focused on the movie reviews but our approach is general enough to be easily adapted to other domains as well For example if we would like to handle product reviews on Amazon or CNET we can simply replace the genres of movies with the categories of products and the writing style and timeliness can still be modeled in the similar way as described in Section 3 This study presents the 036rst step in modeling the helpfulness of reviews For future work we plan to study the related ranking problem i.e how do we rank the reviews based on the helpfulness One way to do this is to rank the reviews based on their predicted helpfulness but we can also develop a model to directly predict the set of most helpful reviews Another possible direction for future work is to incorporate existing votes as an indicator of the future helpfulness and build an adaptive model which can automatically update the predication value of helpfulness as new reviews come in Besides we also plan to incorporate collaborative 036ltering methods such as 6  t o h el p b

 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more applicationñoriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es ó the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.
