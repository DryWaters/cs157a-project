some cases missed detections that have lead to catastrophic mishaps More recently increasing requirements for onboard fault detection isolation and prediction have led to new Prognostic and Health Management PHM technologies which are rapidly being fielded The goal of these systems are to increase onboard diagnostic and prognostic capability without sacrificing and in some cases improving safety and reliability However an inherit tradeoff exists between incipient early fault detection needed for effective prognostics and false alarms That is a system designed to detect incipient faults are more 
likely to indicate a false alarm consequently leading to significant cost and mission readiness drawbacks Thus the design challenge becomes a balance of creating a system that is sensitive to changes caused by incipient faults but also intelligent enough to distinguish them from other system changes i.e changes in speed etc with a high rate of accuracy It is therefore important to understand why false alarms occur and how they are generated so appropriate mitigation solutions can be included in developing diagnostic systems A reduction in 
false alarms will decrease maintenance costs through the reduction of unnecessary replacement of healthy components and the associated time/cost of at-wing at-hanger and OEM component fault testing as well as the cost of the additional burden on the supply system Additional benefits of accurate diagnostic detection include an increase in mission readiness as a result of reduced fleet downtime for unnecessary maintenance as well as increase in pilot and maintainer confidence in aircraft readiness False alarm reduction will also benefit Automated Logistics and Performance-Based Logistics PBL business models that are 
rapidly becoming the standard for next-generation platforms The relationship between false alarms and these performance measures reveals a significant need for false alarm mitigation techniques in legacy diagnostic systems as well as currently maturing mechanical health monitoring strategies such as Prognostic Health Management PHM 2 SOURCES OF FALSE ALARMS Before mitigation techniques can be employed the origins of false alarms must be understood Through a survey of previous analysis experience the authors have identified four major sources of false alarms in the development of 1 


seen in data collected from vibration diagnostic systems for complex machinery systems faulty sensor performance transient operating conditions improper health indicator selection and inadequate fault detection and classification logic Each of these is reviewed in more detail in the following sections Raw Vibration Signal Faulty Sensor Performance Sensor faults are caused by various factors associated with sensor hardware degradation and inadequate data collection methods that can compromise the integrity of data For example accelerometers can be damaged by exposure to excessive shock or temperature or by improper handling by maintenance personnel Other factors are more insidious and arise from loose electrical connections poor solder joints loose mounts ground loops electromagnetic interference EMI and Radio Frequency Interference RFI noise or degradation of sensing instrumentation due to thermal effects Data acquisition effects such as A/D clipping and insufficient dynamic range can also alter the dynamic characteristics of the signal These issues can be very problematic and lead to significant safety concerns i.e onboard and cost increases i.e during development or validation testing where lost data means that a test may have to be repeated In addition changes in the dynamics of a vibration signal due to sensor faults can be deceptively similar to those representative of mechanical failures or vice versa As such a faulty sensor can look very similar to a mechanical fault when analyzed by an automated fault detection system Corrupt data that undergoes subsequent analysis can therefore routinely triggers false alarms Rigorous and automated analysis of the integrity of vibration data is therefore critical to providing accurate health assessments and reducing false alarms The authors have experienced false alarms as a result of corrupt data through previous efforts involving data collection and analysis In one specific example the authors acquired and analyzed data from the test stand of a highspeed thousands of RPMs high-power tens of thousands of horsepower military fighter aircraft drive train Data was collected for over 50 hours of drive train operation Numerous accelerometer channels were available and used in the diagnostic vibration analysis Initial analysis results showed strong responses from several gear diagnostic features at approximately 20 minutes from the end of the test indicating a potential fault However a closer review of the raw vibration data revealed several corrupt accelerometer channels Figure 1 shows the results of the initial analysis As seen in the bottom plot two gear diagnostic features react simultaneously indicating that a potential fault is present in the system However upon further investigation of the raw sensor data top plot one can see that this reaction was caused by a faulty intermittent signal and therefore should not be trusted As seen the feature values return to normal after the sensor problem was corrected Without first evaluating the validity 30 20 10 1000 a Soo  80 0 2 4 6 8 10 Time Seconds Gear Feature Trends FM4 an OEM bearing test rig during can trigger false alarms An example of the influence of operating condition  ff 1  1190 1195 1200 GearMod Feature 4 1185 1190 1195 Test Time Minutes 1200 Figure 1 Feature Reactivity Caused by Faulty Sensor of the sensor was held at constant load and 12 Minutes 13500 RPM 1400 48 Minutes 12500 RPM Time Minutes Figure 2 One Hour Speed Cycle for Bearing Test Data 2  0 85 44 j on vibration response on false alarm rates is I 80000 0601700 4000 a false alarm may have been generated by an automated system that are well understood and documented in literature Dempsey et al discusses the variability of health indicators to environmental effects 1 Generally steady state data is preferred for advanced vibration analysis of shafts gears and bearings As such as variations due to changes in operating conditions an aggressive speed and thrust load test cycle where the thrust load uses these diagnostic features Transient Operating Conditions The effects of operating conditions an important element in reducing false alarms is the selection of data to be processed The relative steady state nature of the data used for calculation of health indicators directly influences the performance of the feature in false alarm statistical metrics

a Military UAV Engine Operational Mode Detection Features extracted from transient operating conditions may also inaccurately describe the health state of system While several advanced techniques exist for feature normalization based on speed load and torque these approaches usually require a priori baseline dataset to accurately characterize a feature's relationship to speed and load Often feature behavior is generalized to be either more inclusive often less accurate or more specialized often less robust in order to increase its effectiveness for a given vehicle platform sensor type or sensor location Problems then arise as sensor locations are changed sensors and subsystems are replaced features are adapted vehicles are disassembled and reassembled and the aircraft ages These factors along with the often complex nature of feature normalization have led the authors to develop a mode Healthy Data for T 4 ol Mode Detect W With Mode C 5 0 4000 4500 0000 5500 Time minutes No Mode FirstCheck TM Feature ri 1   0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Snapshot Waveform Loose Sensor Connection o 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Time sec Waveform Normal Operation 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Time sec Waveform Not Operational 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Time sec Figure 6 Sensor Validation Feature and Corresponding Time Waveforms from o 0 o 1 oo 1--oo 0 000 1000 1 T00 2000 2[00 Faulted Data for T 15 gD 10 _ No Mode Detect With Mode Detect With Mode Detect 3000 3o00 4000 4500 0 0o 1 105 2 20 3 35 Feature Magnitude g2 Detect  0 3 Detect False Alarm 13 detection routine that flags data not worthy of processing in order to mitigate the influence of transient data In response the authors have developed an operational mode detection module to be implemented as a pre-process to feature extraction This module passes data only acquired during system operation within predefined bounds to subsequent processing like feature extraction This logic can be applied to speed shaft RPM torque thrust load pressure temperature radial load altitude acceleration or any other condition parameters This mode detection routine further safeguards against utilizing low-confidence data for feature extraction subsequent feature fusion performance metrics and detection-level reasoning and reserves processing for only high fidelity high load condition data est Healthy Data for Test No Mode Detect Detect False Alarm 7.8 Healthy Healthy Faulted Faulted n 0.5L n X 0.61  0 0 o 2 4 E o10 12 0 1 2 3 4 e 6 7 Feature Magnitude g2 Feature Magnitude g  Figure 7 Effect of Temperature Mode Detection on Hybrid Bearing Feature Results 5  15 0 10\(c Lr    nlnn t-u rV j  In ooo oo 0 Mode Detect No 6000 6500 7000 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Feature Magnitude g2 With Mode est Faulted Data for Test 0.4 No With Mode Detect l 02 0.1 


T*IThe improvement achieved with this technique is demonstrated through an example involving the mode detection module applied to evaluate temperature and speed transients Figure 7 An example of the effects of transient temperatures can be seen in data from seeded fault ceramic bearing testing For the test the rig started in the morning and ran for 10-14 hour shifts at constant speed and variable load While the speed was constant there were durations of the test at startups where the temperature of the system was transient This example illustrates the benefit of implementing a steady state mode detection routine using both speed and operating temperature The graphs on the upper-left in Figure 7 displays the trend of a general health indicator evaluated when the system as assumed healthy and faulted Each graph compares the general trend with blue and with out red the mode detection routine applied The reduced variance achieved with mode detection is clearly demonstrated in the distribution plots shown to the right of each trend respectively and illustrate how each distribution becomes tighter with mode detection applied The bottom distribution plots display the healthy and faulted distributions together The same threshold was used to evaluate the false alarm probability achieved with and with out mode detection The calculation indicates a lower probability of false alarms with the mode detection routine As shown the mode detection module reduces the variance in health indicators subsequently providing tighter statistical healthy and faulted feature distributions This decreases the amount of overlap between the distributions and increases the distance between them improving seperability The improved seperability leads to improved fault detection performance and reduces the probability of false alarms Feature Fusion Fused features were also used to create 2 NA4 T.pe Figu e 2 IS is M 4 12 10 8 6 meQ1 Bele Failt e mis Figure 8 TSA Feature Results for Pinion Failure Dataset Figure 9 Fused Feature Result for Pinion Failure Dataset features  an overall view of 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Time to Failure minutes yp FIure sensors a total of 24 NA4 TBpe Figure Te Fe Kurto5i F sensors can create I------062 1 I CD 0 6 Tare derived from specific combinations of partially correlated algorithms and independent cause determination and Fault Feature 1 1I--1--1-0.9l t Failure 0.0 Fault Detected Rings 0D 1-----Many Features 0 3 are not able to do are good for ascertaining damage progression but may have delayed 6 Fuzzy were therefore combined Figure 9 captures the resulting trend of the single fused feature In comparison the single fused feature highlights the critical failure distinctly while the four features a component's health recorded from various measurement points and interrogated by a higher potential for correct detection level reasoning 2 To demonstrate the advantages of feature fusion the authors compare the performance of four traditional gear fault indicator features evaluated independently a single fused feature Figure 8 displays the trends of the four features analyzed from a single sensor during the last 20 minutes before gear failure These a single fused feature using measurements from six different so when independently evaluated Also a change in magnitude is also identifiable much a features behavior in time Highly reactive features tend to be excellent incipient fault detectors but may result in large spikes same 4 features r-11104 can potentially better characterize the severity of the fault Fault Detection Logic Intelligent fault detection reduces false alarms through advanced interpretation of more clearly in the single fused feature trend at approximately nine minutes prior to failure This indicates a significant change in gear health As illustrated here r T r rtE 0 4 L----I L I  0.5 Fused Gear sensors These unique combinations generate a population of features above the traditional feature list directly extracted from the data An additional though less obvious benefit of feature fusion is to provide a greater diversity of health indicators for detection level reasoning Combining several features from several a variety of health monitoring algorithm The result is lower false alarms increased confidence detection and root versus the performance of a single fused feature not only improves fault detection performance by providing greater accuracy but over time that could trigger false alarms Low reactivity features O 1 J 20

4 AN INTEGRATED APPROACH The authors have developed an integrated approach to mitigating false alarms in PHM systems This approach incorporates some of the previously described false alarm mitigation techniques and applies them following a standard procedure Figure 12 for developing vibration-based prognostic health management systems 3 This approach has been integrated into a software solution to assist engineers in improving performance of legacy diagnostic and PHM monitoring systems The False Alarm Statistic Toolbox for PHM FAST PHMTM software application includes several analysis tools to enable a user to determine the optimal monitoring system design As the figure shows the design process begins with quality diagnostic data The software application includes a capability to communicate with a diagnostic data warehouse through which the software can directly archive and retrieve diagnostic data based on search queries generated by a user Organization and security are some of the advantages to archiving diagnostic data in a central location such as a database The prototype solution includes options to search by aircraft platform and engine units The FAST PHMTm application also presents data collection logs for reference and can interface with third-party applications i.e Microsoft Excel Adobe Acrobat to display the stored data log information Access to a large volume of diagnostic data is advantageous for developing and validating diagnostic monitoring systems but requires methods to reduce large datasets and filter for un-wanted collection periods The FAST PHMTM software application also includes data filtering and provides users with options to reduce or downselect datasets based on specific attributes One example of a data attribute is timestamp Using this attribute a dataset may be reduced based on beginning and ending timestamps Figure 13 Pre-Processing Module Interface Alternative to attributes datasets can also be filtered via analysis with false alarm mitigation techniques such as FirstCheckTm and mode detection module Figure 13 displays a captured screenshot of the FAST PHMTM graphical user interface for applying sensor valdiation and operational mode detection techniques Within this interface the user can configure the modules and change the thresholds used by each routine As a result of this analysis only data from healthy sensors and steady state operating regimes is passed to subsequent diagnostic feature extraction processing The FAST PHMTM software includes built in analysis algorithms to extract traditional health indicators for bearing gears and shafts Significant research has been accomplished in developing quality diagnostic health indicators and their relation to specific types of mechanical component faults and so this paper avoids detailing this topic but includes the following references for additional information 4 8 T Figure 12 An Integrated Approach to Mitigate False Alarms 8 


After the diagnostic features are produced the next procedure in Figure 12 is to intelligently reduce the available set of features and select a subset encapsulating only high performance accurate and robust features The FAST PHMTM software includes visual tools to inspect the behavior of generated features However intelligent feature selection is achieved by evaluating feature performance in the form of metrics The software includes algorithms to assess individual feature performance and return a metric measuring the feature's reactivity distinguishability detection time and stability.[9 For convenience the features can be assorted to a specific metric allowing the user to select the best features most applicable to specific fault detection scenarios For example in a very conservative monitoring system an engineer may elect for features exhibiting strong reactivity over stable features and consequently accept a higher false alarm probability rate Feature selection is an important procedure in improving false alarm mitigation performance by eliminating poorly performing features from subsequent feature fusion and fault detection logic analysis stages After the appropriate features have been identified the next procedure is feature fusion As demonstrated previously in this paper feature fusion improves fault detection capability by combining strengths of the individual features In some cases the performance of the fused feature may also be useful in identifying fault severity Significant research has been completed evaluating different fusion techniques and their role in mechanical fault diagnostic systems 10]-[15 The FAST PHMTM software provides the capability to select existing fusion techniques such as Fuzzy Logic Nueral Networks and Bayesian inference and modify standard templates of these methods to define a feature fusion architecture Alternatively the software also allows a user to define a custom fusion technique to apply Upon configuration and execution of a fusion technique the software returns one or more fused features\(s depending on the design of the architecture The final false alarm mitigation procedure outlined in the approach of Figure 12 combines fault detection isolation and health level reasoning A fault detection logic architecture that satisfies these requirements was discussed earlier in this paper At the core of this architecture is a system level reasoner that can be initially developed using baseline data and then updates itself by learning from additional data The software also features tools to assist a user in specifying thresholds which are necessary in diagnosis faults Defining thresholds for specific health indicating features or fused features can become difficult depending on the properties of the feature data available Thresholds and fault detection performance can be assessed using probability density functions PDFs created from feature data The distribution selected to represent a feature significantly impacts the results validity and accuracy of false alarm probability statistics The FAST PHMTM tool features a Statistical Analysis Wizard and Distribution Fitting Toolbox that aides the user in selecting the most appropriate PDF type for the extracted raw or fused features The tool calls a MATLAB\256 executable to compute a Maximum Likelihood Estimate MLE and perform a Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit test for each common distribution type Normal Rician Rayleigh or Wiebull The tool automatically recommends the best PDF based on the results of the test performed and fits the feature data Alternatively the user may also manually select a distribution to fit to the data With the appropriate distribution selected for the feature dataset the user can visualize the separability of the health states previously defined and interactively apply a threshold to the distribution Figure 14 The tool computes the probability of false alarm probability of incipient detection and the probability of severe fault detection for each threshold This window also plots the Cumulative Distribution Functions CDFs and Receiver Operating Characteristics ROCs in order to further visualize the performance of the feature These features allow the user to maximize the separability between the healthy and faulted distributions thus maximizing fault detection while minimizing false alarm rates Figure 14 Threshold Selection Toolbox Interface 5 CONCLUSIONS Figure 12 provides an overview of the developed false alarm mitigation techniques used in the FAST PHMTM tool to address the major sources of false alarms in PHM systems In the FAST PHMTm application data that is unrepresentative of the monitored system's condition due to sensor malfunction or variation in operating condition is filtered out through sensor validation and mode detection pre-processing algorithms to ensure that it does not generate erroneous diagnostic results The application couples 9 


feature performance metric analysis with feature fusion techniques to produce robust user-defined fused features which further increases diagnostic accuracy by generating performance fused feature highly correlative to fault sensitivity and eliminating weak or poorly performing features This not only improves fault detection performance but also provides a capability to potentially characterize the severity of fault Distribution-fitting and visualization tools enable the user to interactively assess false alarm performance and define acceptable false alarm rates based on changes in feature thresholds Finally robust fault detection logic and decision-level reasoners use feature confidence levels to ensure that PHM results are interpreted correctly The techniques presented are also applicable for mitigating false alarms in real-time as part of the online diagnostic systems For example the sensor validation techniques can be implemented before on-line diagnostic algorithms to eliminate analysis of corrupt data and provide fault indication of faulty sensors In addition monitoring of specific modes of system operation can greatly reduce variation in the diagnostic features Fusion algorithms may also be implemented to accommodate real-time feature fusion to produce fused features with improve detection performance In either implementation these false alarm mitigation techniques combine to create a PHM system with a high level of diagnostic accuracy that will benefit system maintainers by both decreasing unnecessary maintenance costs and increasing the availability of critical machinery 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work has significantly benefited from the invaluable support from the Naval Air Warfare Centre NAVAIR and Joint Strike Fighter program office The authors would also like to acknowledge financial support for this work provided through the Navy Small Business Innovative Research SBIR program 7 REFERENCES 1 Dempsy P.J et al Investigation of Current Methods to Identify Helicopter Gear Health NASA/TM-2007214664 2007 2 B.V Dasarathy Sensor Fusion Potential Exploitation-Innovative Architectures and Illustrative Applications Proceedings of IEEE 85\(1 24-38 January 1997 3 Roemer M Dzakowic J Orsagh R Byington C and G Vachtsevanos Validation and Verification of Prognostic and Health Management Technologies 2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 5-12 2005 4 Lebold M McClintic K Campbell R Byington C and K Maynard Review of Vibration Analysis Methods for Gearbox Diagnostics and Prognostics 54th Meeting of the Society for MFPT Conference Proceedings May 1-4 2000 5 Braun S and B Datner Analysis of Roller/Ball Bearing Vibrations J of Mechanical Design 101 118-25 1979 6 T.A Harris Rolling Bearing Analysis New York John Wiley  Sons Inc 2001 993-1000 7 Orsagh R Lee H Watson M Byington C and J Powers Application of Health and Usage Monitoring System HUMS Technologies to Wind Turbine Drive Trains WindPower 2005 Conference Proceedings May 15-18 2005 8 Sabnavis G Kirk R Kasarda M and D Quinn Cracked Shaft Detection and Diagnostics A Literature Review Shock and Vibration Digest 36\(4 287-296 2004 9 Byington C Safa-Bakhsh R Watson M and P Kalgren Metrics Evaluation and Tool Development for Health and Usage Monitoring System Technology AHS Annual Forum 59 Conference Proceedings May 6-8 2003 10 S.A Storm An Investigation of the Effects of Correlation in Sensor Fusion Air Force Institute of Technology 2003 11 J.D Erdley Improved Fault Detection Using Multisensor Data Fusion The Pennsylvania State University 1997 12 Crowley J.L and Y Demazeau Principles and Techniques for Sensor Data Fusion PRIMA-Signal Processing 1993 13 Dempsy P.J et al Spiral Bevel Gear Damage Detection Using Decision Fusion Analysis NASA/TM-2002-211814 2002 14 Dempsy P.J et al Transmission Bearing Damage Detection Using Decision Fusion Analysis NASA/TM-2004-213382 2004 15 Stover J.A et al A Fuzzy-Logic Architecture for Autonomous Multisensor Data Fusion IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics 43\(3 403-410 June 1996 10
