method  uses  a  compact  image  signature  which  depends  on  image  content  and  is  invariant  to  many  widely  used  image  processing  techni q ues  such  as  lossy  compression  resizing  resampling  color  enhancements  and  simple  rotations  The  signature  is  designed  to  be  usable  in  big  image  database  it  has  small  size  a  few  dozen  bytes    the  e x traction  is  fast  and  the  comparison  of  image  signatures  is  very  fast  More  than  milion  of  image  signatures  per  second  can  be  compared  on  a  modern  PC  Usage  of  the  method  within  a  framework  for  Digital  Rights  Infringements  Detection  in  the  World  Wide  Web  is  also  discussed   Keywords Still  image  duplicate  detection  image  signature  search  and  retrieval

data  is  often  modified  during  the  distribution  to  meet v arious  re q uirements  of  networks  storage  capacity  or  capabilities  of  user  e q uipment  Different  multimedia  de v ices  and  networks  often  need  data  in  specific  formats  bitrates  and  resolutions    so  the  data  must  be  transformed  according  to  these  needs   e  g  different  format  is  preferred  by  high  resolution  printers H D  displays P C  monitors  and  mobile  phones   This  makes  the  possibility  that  the  same  material  is  stored  and  distributed  in  modified v ersions  and v arious  formats  The  e x amples  of  modifications  which  may  be  applied  to v isual  data  are  rescaling  lossy  compression  changing  of  color  depth  and  image  enhancements  such  as  changing  brightness  saturation  blurring  or  sharpening   The  goal  of  copy  detection  systems  is  to  allow  the  detection  and  localization  of  all v ariants  of  the  same  multimedia  material  including  the  modified  v ersions  The  detection  should  be  fast  reliable  and  robust  to  widely  used  techni q ues  of  adaptation  or  enhancement  of  the  material   In  this  paper  a  techni q ue  for  still  image  copy  detection  is  presented  A  practical  application  of  this  techni q ue  may  be  for  e x ample  an  image  copyright  protection  system  which  uses  image  copy  detection  module  for  searching  copies  of  copyrighted  images  in  public  networks  A nother  e x ample  is  an  application  of  digital  photo  management  Many  users  of  digital  cameras  often  process  their  photos  in  popular  image  processing  applications  and  multiple   modified   copies  of  the  same  photo  may  be  stored  in  their  photo  galleries  Copy  detection  tool  would  allow  users  to  find  photos  ha v ing  different v ersions  in  their  pri v ate  photo  galleries   A  number  of  papers  in v estigated  the  problem  of  still  image  copy  detection  Some  of  them  proposed  techni q ues  which  utilize v arious v isual  features  such  as  color  shape  or  te x ture  1    2   3   O ther  methods  use  interest  points  to  inde

To  be  usable  for  big  image  repositories  containing  millions  of  images  the  application  of  image  replica  detection  should  pro v ide    fast  feature  e x traction  algorithm    small

possibility  of  designing  a v isual  identifier  which  can  be  used  for  image  replica  detection  was  also  in v estigated  by  standardization  acti v ities  of  M PE G  group  They  defined  re q uirements  for  image  signature  which  can  be  used  for  content based  image  identification  These  re q uirements  contain  e x perimental  conditions  for  two  different  scenarios  fast  algorithm  with  high  success  rate  for  replicas  obtained  by  basic  modifications  and  possibly  slower  algorithm  which  will  detect  image  replicas  obtained  by  hea v y  modifications  Two  contributions  which  fulfill  the  re q uirement  of  basic  image  signature  ha v e  been  submitted  O ne  contribution  use  Radon  transform 6 to  compute  features  in v ariant  to  basic

and  ne x t  it  is  matched  to  all  the  signatures  of  the  images  in  the  database   The  matching  algorithm  compares  bit streams  of  two  signatures  and  the  distance  is  the H amming

In the ideal amplifier case both the BPSK and 12-4 QAM meet the ACI mask with OBO=3 dB The hump in the BPSK lobe is the result of it being statistically more likely to have a zero-crossing in BPSK modulation than 12-4 QAM In addition an OBO of 3 dB is similar to IPAPR95 implying that IPAPR95 may be a reasonable offset factor between linear and saturated EIRP The second case of study is simulation of memory-less nonlinear models such as AM-AM and AM-PM The manufacturers provided large-signal measurement-based AM-AM and AM-PM models of SSPAs A and B to simulate using the LLAT software The spectral re-growth of these models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a shows the onset of spectral re-growth much earlier than the ideal amplifier case Since SSPAs A and B have different AM-AM characteristics shown as power compression curves in Figure 1 and Figure 2 the re-growth characteristics are also different between the two models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a for SSPA A and Figure 7\(a and Figure 8\(a for SSPA B Although the memory-less non-linear models show larger re-growth than the ideal amplifier model for both BPSK and 12-4 QAM they provide an optimistic expectation of only a few dB OBO requirement for most spectral masks The third case of study is a measurement of the two SSPA devices using LLAT Each device is characterized using BPSK and 12-4 QAM waveforms at 3.75 and 15 Msps In the case of SSPA A the device without significant memory effects BPSK modulation at the two data rates shown in Figure 5\(b and Figure 5\(c match closely with the model simulation in Figure 5\(a A degradation of a few dB in spectral re-growth is observed when comparing the measured data and the model The measurements also match closely with the model for 12-4 QAM shown in Figure 6\(b and Figure 6\(c 5 CONCLUSION During the early planning and design phase of a SATCOM terminal it is important to predict the expected radiated power from a transmitting amplifier This is especially true for small mobile terminals where size weight and power are at a premium Under these conditions the transmitting amplifiers must be optimized for power efficiency and linearity Understanding how the non-linear effects of an amplifier distort a waveform is a difficult task especially when limited to single-tone data Simulations show that a few dB of OBO is required to meet an ACI mask of 30 dBc even with in an ideal power-limited amplifier IPAPR95 of a waveform is a reasonable estimate for required OBO Measurements indicate that it is possible to realize Q-band solid-state amplifiers that approximate an ideal power-limited amplifier however care must be taken not to add memory into the device when optimizing it for high-power and high-efficiency performance Future work will investigate the limitations of two-tone measurements in predicting distortion since two-tone waveforms have a limited PAPR 5 LLAT is capable of fully interrogating an amplifier in order to develop highfidelity behavioral models 6 7 Ongoing work aims to understand how millimeter-wave solid-state and travelingwave tube amplifier distortions relate to ACI EVM and BER as data rate increases However SSPA B which has strong memory presents two effects The first is degradation in spectral re-growth in the first side-band region of 5 to 10 dB for the lower data rate shown in Figure 7\(b for BPSK and Figure 8\(b for 12-4 QAM The higher data rate has 10 to 15 dB degradation in the first side band shown in Figure 7\(c and Figure 8\(c The second effect is the asymmetry in the re-growth between the highand low-side bands The memory-less non-linear model based on single-tone measurements of SSPA B does not make any predictions of side-band asymmetry The strong memory in SSPA B was determined to be the result of bias circuitry originally designed for maximum power and efficiency using single-tone measurements Modifications to the bias network improved the performance and significantly reduced the memory effects 6

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
