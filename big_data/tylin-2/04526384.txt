transmitter and receiver must be known precisely during data recording As such this paper concentrates on the baseline estimation for DS-InSAR systems The spatial baseline of DS-InSAR is described in many aspects and an equation to determine the optimal spatial baseline is derived Moreover a high precision ranging technique is proposed to resolve the baseline estimation for high resolution spaceborne DSInSAR systems 1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 2 3 4 5 6 INTRODUCTIO

in a SAR image are then distorted relative to a planimetric view For many applications this altitude-dependent distortion adversely affects the interpretation of the imagery Hence the development of interferometry SAR InSAR techniques has enabled measurement of the third dimension InSAR is 1 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1036 Version 2 Nov 25 2007 an imaging technique for measuring the topography of a surface its changes over time and other changes in the detailed characteristics of the surface 1 
However conventional repeat-pass InSAR may suffer from temporal decorrelation and atmospheric distortions Such disadvantages may be avoided by using distributed SAR They can provide multiple long baselines in single-pass observation mode thus greatly improving the performance of InSAR and ground moving-target indicator GMTI Distributed InSAR enables a flexible imaging geometry with large baselines thereby increasing significantly the interferometric performance for remote sensing applications such as digital elevation model DEM generation in comparison to a single platform system Furthermore combining a broad 
illumination source with multiple small receiving antennas placed on distributed micro-satellites we can obtain simultaneous high resolution and wide swath images 2 Another reason is to mitigate the cost fabrication and deployment issues associated with placing a large satellite into its orbit Several distributed satellites have been suggested to provide an almost constant interferometric baseline across the whole orbit 3 4 A promise configuration is the constellations with multiple baselines at a fixed baseline ratio If the baseline ratio is chosen such that the height errors from the 
DEM acquisition with the smallest baseline stay below the height of ambiguity for the large baseline it would hence be possible to use the interferometric data from the small baseline acquisition to resolve phase ambiguities in the highly sensitive large baseline interferogram 5 Additionally large bandwidth interferometrogram systems may apply the split spectrum approach to determine the absolute interferometric phase 6 More importantly simultaneous availability of multiple baselines with different lengths can reduce significantly the phase ambiguity gap between the large baseline 
interferogram and the synthetic low-frequency interferograms 7 By this it is possible to push the DEM performance up to the limit of the critical baseline Another opportunity of distributed SAR is along-track interferometry which compares the phase of two complex SAR images acquired in identical geometries but separated by a short time interval 8 Large along-track baselines are required to detect the objects with slow-moving targets whereas short baselines are required to avoid ambiguities in the case of high velocities Hence 1 


distributed SAR with along-track baselines would be again of great help to resolve ambiguities thereby enabling improved and more accurate velocity measurements Distributed spaceborne InSAR DS-InSAR developments in recent years have addressed some of the limitations in conventional SAR systems and subsequently have opened many new remote sensing applications because it can avoid time decorrelation between the interferometric signals and improve the topographic measure sensitivity owing to large baseline formed among the satellites But DS-InSAR has some new technical challenges such as bistatic radar squintmodel baseline instability and large baseline and so on These parameters directly affect the achievable geometrical resolution and the geometry of the radar system Since baseline is an important parameter and it is crucial in DSInSAR system design data processing and DEM reconstruction some techniques must be provided to accurately estimate the spatial baseline of DS-InSAR systems As such this paper concentrates on the baseline estimation in DS-InSAR systems The spatial baseline of DS-InSAR is described and an equation to determine the optimal spatial baseline is derived In general InSAR its baseline will not change or change less in the whole imaging time However in DS-InSAR due to the unstability of the two radar platforms the baseline will change during the flying time and it should be estimated differently Hence a high precision ranging technique is proposed to resolve the baseline estimation for high resolution DS-InSAR systems The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows In section 2 the geometry and basic principle on the baseline of DS-InSAR systems are described followed by the optimal baseline design in Section 3 To estimate the change of baseline caused by the relative movement between transmitter and receiver a high precision ranging technique is proposed to resolve the baseline estimation in section 4 followed by the analysis of estimation performance in Section 5 Finally the conclusion is provided in Section 6 2 BASELINE IN DS-INSAR There are spatial baseline and temporal baseline in an InSAR system spatial baseline is the spatial separation of two antennas and temporal baseline is the temporal separation It is known that the interferometric coherence mainly depends on three sources 9 a decorrelation due to spatial separation b decorrelation due to physical changes in the surface over the time period between observations c decorrelation due to surface motion of the individual scattering centers within each resolution elements The first is spatial decorrelation and the last two belongs to temporal decorrelation Note that only spatial baseline is considered in this paper Without loss of generality considering a configuration of DS-InSAR here is a bistatic configuration we have 10 B A2 A1 a 0  HO r  Ar r P~~~~~~~~~~~~Pt o Fig I Typical configuration of DS-InSAR system s1 xo yo   f x y exp j 4iJ 1 xW x xO  y y0  dxdy  il where f x y represents the complex scattering elements of the scene W\(x,y represents the impulse response of the SAR r is the distance to the scatterers A is the radar wavelength x and y are the azimuth and ground range coordinates and n1 represents a complex noise amplitude added to the SAR signal respectively The corresponding pixel amplitude for the second receiver is given by s2 XO yO   Jff x y exp K-j4 4\(rh  Arh 2 xW x xO y y0  dxdy  n2 where we have assumed that the misregistration is only in the range dimension but not the azimuth dimension The correlation of the signals from two receivers can be expressed as  exp j 4ffyB s\(sinff\(x-x0  Etsis exp I it70ff Ar T\(x xo  xL sinfT y Y Vry dxdy If\(y_ Vry  3 where a is simply the average scattering cross section B is the spatial baseline r and ir are the resolution in x and y coordinates respectively Practically Eq 3 can be further simplified into 9 E{sls Qrxr Ar xp j e rx 4 If let E{s,s  0 5 2
