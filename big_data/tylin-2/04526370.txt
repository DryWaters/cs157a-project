Application-layer Codec Adaptation for Dynamic Bandwidth Resource Allocation Eugene Grayver Jiayu Chen Alexander Utter The Aerospace Corporation eugene.grayvergaero.org Abstract Next generation satellite payloads must optimize the use of available spectrum to deliver the highest possible data rates while maintaining a required quality of service QoS The satellite channel is highly variable due to changes in the environment such as cloud cover rain etc Mobile ground terminals introduce another degree of channel volatility The dynamic bandwidth resource allocation DBRA technique 
addresses the channel dynamics by continuously monitoring key link parameters and adaptively optimizing the physical layer parameters These modifiable parameters include symbol rate modulation error correction code rate spreading factor transmit power etc A flexible radio that supports all of these parameters is coupled to a dynamic channel emulator to evaluate DBRA system performance A complete DBRA system must also address the networking layer and even the application layer As the satellite channel conditions change all layers must respond appropriately to 
maintain QoS and avoid exceeding available data rates Poor coordination can result in dropped calls or worse This paper describes a DBRA testbed with multiple audio and video codecs that are selected without renegotiation Experimental results and lessons learned are presented A brief background on modern video and audio codecs is also provided 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 NETWORK PERSPECTIVE

C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1466 Version 1 Updated Oct 30 2007 traffic demand 1 These applications range from data services such as file transfer e-mail and web applications to imagery 
voice and video services and other potential emerging applications While satellite cross-links are relatively stable with little interference the available bandwidth in uplinks and downlinks can change rapidly due to weather jamming and other atmospheric effects When the signal-to-noise ratio SNR of a satellite link decreases because of changing channel conditions the physical layer transmission modulation format and error correcting coding rate can be changed to a more robust mode Typically transmission power and RF bandwidth are constrained so the new format must 
have a reduced datarate In addition the data-rate available to individual users can be affected by the demands of other users of the satellite At the link-layer DBRA allocates bandwidth and time-slots to each terminal based on traffic load and traffic priority 2 Software defined radio SDR allows the transceiver to rapidly adapt to these changes SDR is the enabling technology that incorporates multiple approaches to design of flexible transceivers SDR is already being widely used on the ground and is starting to penetrate into satellites 
The mode changes and new resource allocations can occur on sub-second intervals to account for the dynamics of the satellite links This paper describes a real-time hardware testbed designed to test DBRA techniques applied to video conferencing The application layer codec/compression adjustment is implemented in the emulation testbed to study its effects on the quality of video transmission Higher data rates are desirable because they result in higher-fidelity audio and video However if data rates ever exceed the available bandwidth the resulting packet 
losses result in major graphical errors or outright failure Without adaptation video data rate would need to be set for worst-case conditions resulting in needlessly poor quality when channel conditions are good 2 NETWORK PERSPECTIVE Changes to the transmission mode and bandwidth available can cause packet loss delay and jitter delay variation but different types of applications have different sensitivity to these effects For example moderate packet delay and jitter for data services such as file transfer and e-mail do not 1 


impact the accuracy of the received data but packet loss is catastrophic without a mechanism for re-transmission On the other hand real-time applications such as voice conversations and video conferencing are very sensitive to delay but can tolerate small packet losses Network layer Layer 3 in the OSI Model QoS capabilities provide mechanisms for bounding performance metrics such as delay loss and jitter as well as preferential treatment for traffic with higher priority All application traffic flows can be classified to a set of classes denoted by the Differentiated Services DiffServ codepoint DSCP The payload router applies data plane traffic policing including packet classification marking metering and shaping to achieve performance bounds on loss delay and jitter Real-time applications and other high-priority services can be designated as guaranteed services where bandwidth reservations are done through control plane signaling e.g Resource ReSerVation Protocol RSVP or Aggregate RSVP ARSVP If the available bandwidth for a certain link is insufficient to satisfy all the reservation requests the multi-level precedence and preemption MLPP capability will be used to preempt or reduce the bandwidth reservation based on precedence of individual applications Preemption or reduced bandwidth allocation for individual application flows may result in dropped calls or poor quality of service in terms of packet loss delay and jitter This paper examines the effect of adaptively adjusting the data rates for real-time applications in response to reduced allocation of channel capacity or bandwidth This can be achieved by adjusting compression quality and changing the video and audio compression/decompression algorithms codecs in the application layer as shown in Figure 1 By adjusting the transmitted data rate as allocated bandwidth is reduced we achieve marginal reductions in image quality instead of dropped calls/sessions or severe packet loss There are many types of codecs for example ITU G.711 G.726 G.729 for Voice over IP VoIP and MPEG-4 and ITU H.264 for video Each codec provides different compression ratios that may be used to trade off bandwidth against received image/voice fidelity 0 CD 0 a  In existing systems VoIP and video sessions are usually initiated with a handshaking process using a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol SIP defined by IETF In this protocol the originating SIP endpoint sends a SIP INVITE message with its media information e.g IP address port media type and codecs it supports in the Session Description Protocol SDP portion of the SIP message body When the terminating SIP endpoint responds with an OK message it also includes its media information including the codecs it supports in the SDP part of the message The originating endpoint then selects a codec that both endpoints support and completes the rest of the call setup to open voice or video media transmission with Real-time Transport Protocol RTP packets The Payload Type field of the RTP header instructs the receiving end what codec is used to encode this packet In the DBRA system available bandwidth can change suddenly When either of the endpoints is informed of such a change or detects excessive packet losses it can trigger codec changes to adopt a higher compression rate to conserve bandwidth Mid-call codec changes could be achieved by one of two ways  Signaling re-negotiation for the new codec using SIP Re-INVITE message This requires two-way negotiations and may take some time to re-establish a connection  Allowing the transmitter to unilaterally change the codec This can be done on-the-fly with no time spent negotiating a new connection 3 TESTBED An end-to-end physical layer test bed consists of a hardware-based highly programmable transceiver 3 a channel emulator 4 and a software-based DBRA controller Figure 2 shows the overall flow of the DBRA waveform changes and application bandwidth requirements adjustment in response to channel condition changes A photograph of the testbed is presented in Figure 3 PH time Figure 1 Application Bandwidth Adjustment 2

The fading channel is cascaded with a programmable phasenoise channel to model the non-idealities in the transmitter and receiver oscillators 4 GUI  0 Figure 7 Bandwidth controller emulator Figure 6 Channel emulator block diagram Bandwidth Controller A typical DBRA system uses a bandwidth controller to allocate portions of the allocated spectrum among multiple users As discussed in the introduction users may be given different priority levels and a single user may request multiple data streams each with a different bandwidth requirement and a different priority level The testbed used for this work emulates the operation of the bandwidth controller by allowing the operator to explicitly set the available bandwidth The operator may also enable a randomized bandwidth assignment in which case a new bandwidth is selected randomly from a pre-defined set at regular intervals The user interface for the controller emulator is shown in Figure 7 4 FRAMING AND SYNCHRONIZATION As discussed in the introduction the multimedia codec configuration is defined in the header of each data packet However that header is not appropriate for reconfiguration of the physical layer The overhead of interpreting the IP packets and the latency associated with the decoding would make the system very inefficient A custom low-level signaling scheme was designed for the system described in this paper The transceiver is typically configured by the host either an external computer or an embedded processor and operates in the configured mode until the host loads another configuration The host-initiated configuration may be too slow and/or incur too much latency in some cases Some of the cases that require rapid reconfiguration are  dynamic bandwidth resource allocation DBRA In this case the transmitter may change the bandwidth allocated to the user with very little warning to the user The changes may also occur frequently  adaptive modulation and coding In this case the transmitter may change the modulation and/or coding in response to the channel variation as reported by the receiver  cognitive radio In this case the transmitter may change bandwidth and/or frequency in response to external stimuli and require the receiver to respond quickly Frame support for R3 The transceiver physical layer provides hardware and software support for rapid runtime reconfiguration R3 The goal is to synchronously reconfigure both the transmitter and the receiver such that a minimum amount of data is lost In all cases the reconfiguration is dictated and timed by the transmitter The frame structure is extended to include fields for R3 by appending a 32-bit field after the frame header as shown in Figure 8 The first 16 bits of the R3 field define the format that shall be used for future communication The format is intended to be used as an index into a table of formats that are negotiated between the 4 


transmitter and receiver This table would include entries such as the bandwidth modulation coding carrier frequency etc The next 16 bits of the R3 field define the number of frames remaining before the new format is to take effect This count field serves multiple purposes but in each case it allows adequate time for the receiver to prepare for the reconfiguration In a typical scenario the transmitter will determine that a format change is necessary at some point in the near future It announces the format change by beginning a countdown in the count field For example if each frame has a duration of 100 microseconds a format change 5 milliseconds in the future begins in 50 frames The count field in each subsequent frame would read 50 49 48 and so on The receiver tracks this countdown but also knows the duration of each frame and decrements its internal counter at the appropriate time whether it receives a frame or not As long as the receiver successfully receives even one frame during the countdown it will reach zero at the intended time If the transmitter does not wish to schedule a reconfiguration it can repeatedly transmit a large constant value in the count field Each received frame will reset the countdown timer and no reconfiguration will occur This practice doubles as a watchdog timer in the case where synchronization is lost if the receiver loses reception for an extended period of time it will automatically switch to the format specified in the last received frame In a cognitive radio for example this allows the transmitter to specify a backup format in the event of some unexpected interference Note that the receiver strips the R3 header both the format and count fields and only passes the frame data to downstream blocks 4 N bits 0--16 bits 16 bits Figure 8 Frame format for rapid runtime reconfig Configuration interface for R3 The host may not be fast enough to reconfigure the transmitter and/or receiver quickly enough to avoid loosing a significant amount of data A nontrivial amount of computation is required to determine the appropriate values for all the configuration registers On the other hand putting sufficient intelligence for reconfiguration into the FPGA firmware would be prohibitively complex A compromise is reached by having the host pre-compute all the register values and load them into a buffer The buffer contains a sequence of reconfiguration instructions consisting of an address and a data The FPGA firmware then generates a trigger to quickly execute all the instructions in the buffer The trigger is based on the R3 count field Once R3 reaches zero both the transmitter and receiver start the reconfiguration simultaneously A block diagram showing the host and the buffer is shown in Figure 9 Note that the host interface always has priority over the bus since there's no mechanism for reporting a pre-empted transfer The command buffer monitors the bus and injects commands only when the host is idle Host I Commad Transceiver Buffer start trigger Figure 9 Command buffer interface for R3 R3 Locking Behavior The rapid reconfiguration described above can take thousands of clock cycles and will typically cause the receiver to lose lock The transition from one format to the next cannot be easily scheduled to occur over just one sample The datapath in both transmitter and receiver is highly pipelined i.e the downstream blocks are processing older samples while the upstream blocks have already started processing new samples A seamless transition between the formats would require each of the blocks to be configured instantaneously and in a very precise sequence The sequencing would have to be precise to within a clock cycle This precision would be very difficult to achieve in general and especially since the configuration logic runs at a lower clock frequency than the signal processing logic Therefore at least one frame will be lost during the reconfiguration Typically a loss of lock is declared after missing unlock after consecutive frame headers and a lock is declared after seeing lock after consecutive frame headers Since the reconfiguration is known to cause a loss of lock the lock status should be reset at the start of the reconfiguration sequence This will allow the synchronization logic to immediately start looking for a new synch pattern and save the loss of unlock after frames In addition the timing tracking will unlock if the data rate in the new format differs from the previous format However the phase tracking should remain valid Invalid timing tracking output can cause the phase tracking to unlock if the decision directed phase error detector is used Therefore the phase tracking loop should be frozen at the beginning of the reconfiguration process and released at the end 5 


5 MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM The VLC media player provides the video codec subsystem 7 This highly flexible open-source player integrates the video encoding streaming and decoding interfaces The player can be controlled via a Telnet connection providing the necessary automation interface to the DBRA controller The encoder captures raw data from a high-end webcam and encodes it into one of the supported formats The format selected for this research effort is H.264 a standard for video conferencing 8 This format can be configured for a wide range of data rates from a few dozen kbps to few Mbps The encoded data is streamed over the RTP/UDP 9 interface on the local computer A UDP client captures the packets and passes them to the transmitter If the UDP data rate exceeds the throughput of the waveform selected at the transceiver UDP packets are dropped After passing through the transmitter channel and the receiver the UDP packets are reconstructed by a UDP server The UDP server then streams the UDP packets on the receiver computer The UDP packets generated by the VLC include sufficient information about the video codec for the receiver to process them without any side-channel input Therefore the DBRA controller communicates video compression changes only to the transmitter-side VLC application TCP/IP Hardware Testbed Software defined radio opens a wide range of exciting opportunities No longer is a wireless link designed for the worst-case conditions only Instead the available bandwidth is optimally utilized over a range of conditions The average throughput and therefore average user experience is significantly improved This improvement comes at a cost of additional complexity at multiple layers of the communications protocol stack A designer must be aware of the ramifications of physical layer changes on the network and even application layers The design of the adaptive physical layer and video codec infrastructure is rather involved Initial results with usercontrolled DBRA events have been obtained A high data rate 4 Mbps physical link is first established and high quality low compression video stream is sent The high quality video frame grab is shown in Figure 11 The physical link bandwidth is then reduced to 64kbps Video data packets are now necessarily dropped resulting in very dramatic degradation in video quality Large portions of the image have been corrupted as shown in Figure 12 The video compression is then adjusted to match the physical layer throughput The resulting video stream is now less sharp but clearly superior to the previous case as can be seen in Figure 13 Adjusting the data rate at the application layer is therefore an important aspect of the DBRA system Without this link real-time applications cannot take advantage of conditions better than the worst case satellite link worst case terminal mobility and worst case traffic demand dynamics Taking advantage of the dynamic allocation of satellite resources requires coordination between all network layers including mechanisms for physical layer mode change link layer bandwidth allocation network layer QoS capabilities and application layer changes to data rate Figure 10 Video subsystem block diagram 6 6 CONCLUSION
