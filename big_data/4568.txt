Weber-Jahnke University of Victoria BC Canada Email jens@cs.uvic.ca Abstract Graphs have become increasingly popular for modeling data in a wide variety of applications and graph summarization is a useful technique to analyze information from large graphs Privacy preserving mechanisms are vital to protect the privacy of individuals or institutions when releasing aggregate numbers such as those in graph summarization We propose privacy-aware release of graph summarization using zero-knowledge privacy ZKP a recently proposed privacy framework that is more effective than differential privacy DP for graph and social network databases We rst deìne groupbased graph summaries Next we present techniques to compute the parameters required to design ZKP methods for each type of aggregate data Then we present an approach to achieve ZKP for probabilistic graphs I I NTRODUCTION Nowadays the graphs of many real world datasets are very large For example Facebook the most well-known social network contains data for over 900 million users and their relationships Therefore effective summarization methods need to be employed in order to make the analysis of such large graphs possible We focus on graph summarization based on attribute groups For instance the nodes of a social graph can be grouped by attributes age and profession and statistics about the number of cross-group edges can be recorded Statistics can reveal interesting facts about a graph For instance they could show surprising strong connections between groups of people in different age and profession groups As such groupbased graph summarization GGS is a ubiquitous operation in virtually all the graph/social network software products cf  3 1 2 etc The result of GGS is a smaller summary graph where each node summarizes a group of nodes in the original graph The problem is that as with other aggregations the summary graphs are often released to other parties for further research purposes and this brings up the matter of privacy Aggregate data included in a summary graph can reveal sensitive and private information about the nodes participants of the underlying graph network Privacy-preserving data release has become one of the most important problems today  Differential Privacy 11  DP for short has been one of the leading pri v a c y mechanisms in recent years DP provides privacy for an individual of interest IOI by adding random noise to numerical outputs Some recent studies cf 20 ho we v e r  ha v e highlighted situations in which DP might not provide sufìcient privacy protection This is especially pronounced in social networks where different types of auxiliary information including the structure of network or the groups the individuals belong in are often readily available to the public cf More speciìcally whereas the goal of DP is to protect the participation of an individual or relationship in a dataset in social networks we also need to protect the evidence of participation cf T o see this we present the follo wing example Suppose there are two groups g 1 and g 2 and we want to publish the number of edges between them Bob a member of g 1  has an edge to Alice a member of g 2  As a consequence of this connection some friends of Bob introduce edges to Alice What we want to protect is Bobês edge to Alice DP works in this case by ensuring that for any true answer c or c  1  the sanitized answer would be pretty much the same However this is not strong enough the existence of Bobês edge changes the true answer not just by 1 but by a bigger number as it causes more edges to be created between the two groups Going beyond differential privacy Gehrke Lui and Pass proposed zero-knowledge privacy ZKP in which provides stronger privacy especially for social graphs The deìnition of ZKP is based on classes of aggregate functions ZKP guarantees that an attacker cannot discover any personal information more than what can be inferred from some aggregate on a sample of a database with IOI removed The sample complexity deìnes the level of privacy tolerance in ZKP For instance suppose in the Bobês example above the network size is 10000 and the sample size is   10000  100  With such a sampling rate of 0  01 the evidence provided by say 10 more edges caused by Bobês edge will essentially be protected with a high probability none of these 10 edges will be in the sample In this paper we use ZKP to provide individual privacy in graph summarization We address connection measures for groups in social graphs and present ZKP mechanisms for private release of such aggregate outputs To the best of our knowledge we are the rst to use ZKP for group-based graph summarizations which are ubiquitous in analyzing social graphs As ZKP inherently depends on the precise characterization of sample complexity we propose methods to compute the sample complexity of our aggregate functions In order to achieve this we present techniques to express the aggregate functions as averages of specially designed synthetic attributes on the nodes of the graph Then we derive precise prescriptions on how to construct ZKP mechanisms for the aggregate functions we consider 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 597 


More speciìcally our contributions in this paper are as follows  We deìne group connection measures for graph summarization and consider different scenarios for zeroknowledge private release of summary graphs based on the type of personal information that is to be protected We introduce synthetic attributes that simplify the construction and analysis of ZKP-mechanisms for graph summarization  We present detailed examples and numeric evaluations of our ZKP mechanisms in terms of the parameters involved These evaluations are valid for any case and illustrate the trade offs involved when building ZKP mechanisms for graph summarization  We also present summarization measures for probabilistic graphs This is especially important in social networks having edges of different inîuence captured by probabilities assigned on the edges II R ELATED W ORK Graph summarization is a ubiquitous method for analyzing large graphs Virtually all the graph/social network products cf 3 1 2 etc create summaries in the form of smaller graphs by grouping the nodes based on attributes The common goal of privacy preserving methods is to learn from data while protecting sensitive information of the individuals k-anonymity for social graphs cf 8 9 provides privacy by ensuring that combinations of identifying attributes appear at least k times in the dataset The problem with k-anonymity and other related approaches e.g ldiversity is that the y assume the adv ersary has limited auxiliary knowledge Narayanan and Shmatikov present a de-anonymization algorithm and claim that k-anonymity can defeated by their method using auxiliary data accessible by the adversary Among a multitude of different techniques differential privacy DP 10 13 11 has become one of the leading methods to provide individual privacy Various differentially private algorithms have since been developed for different domains including social networks 27 Ho we v e r a s already shown DP can suffer in social networks where speciìc auxiliary information such as graph structures and friendship data is easily available to the adversary Important works showing the shortcomings of DP are 21 Gehrke Lui and Pass in present the notion of zeroknowledge privacy which is appealing for achieving privacy in social networks Zero-knowledge privacy ZKP guarantees that what can be learned from a dataset including an individual is not more than what is learned from sampling-based aggregates computed on the dataset without that individual III G RAPH S UMMARIZATION We denote a graph as G  V E   where V is the set of nodes and E  V  V is the set of edges connecting the nodes We consider S 2 V to be a set of disjoint node groups of  g g a g g 75,.33,1 b 4 6 Fig 1 A graph and its summarization size r or more that a social network wants to release statistics about Deìnition 1 The S graph of G is G G  S  S  E S   where E S    g  g   g  g  S and  v   g  and  v   g  such that  v  v    E   This deìnition says that two groups g  and g  in S are connected through an edge in G G  S if there exists at least one edge in G that connects a node in g  to a node in g   Deìnition 2 The S graph summarization  S GS is a function w 1  S 0  1 w 2  E S  0  1  0  1  0  1 w 1  g   g   V  w 2  g  g    x y z   where x   v   g    v   g   s.t  v  v    E   g   z   v   g    v   g   s.t  v  v    E   g   y    v  v   v   g  v   g    v  v    E   g   g    Throughout the paper we will refer to the elements of w 2 as w 2  g  g   x   w 2  g  g   y   and w 2  g  g   z  or w 2  x   w 2  y   w 2  z   whenever g  and g  are clear from the context We will also use w 2    to refer to any of three elements x  y  or z  Example 1 Fig.1 a shows a simple graph G  and S consisting of two groups g  and g   Group g  has four nodes and group g  has six nodes There are several edges eight of them connecting members of g  to members of g   Fig.1 b shows how g  and g  are represented by a node each in G G  S  The nodes and the edge connecting them in G G  S are labeled by w 1 and w 2 measures respectively as described above Speciìcally we have w 1  g   4 4+6   4 and w 1  g   6 4+6   6  Since three out of four nodes in g  and all the six nodes in g  are connected with some nodes in the other group we have w 2  g  g    3 4  8 4  6  6 6    75  33  1  598 


IV B ACKGROUND ON  Z ERO K NOWLEDGE P RIVACY Zero-Knowledge Privacy ZKP introduced by is a privacy framework that is stronger than Differential Privacy  DP  ZKP is especially desirable in social networks where we need to protect not only the participation of a connection but also easy to nd evidence of the participation as for example the evidence given by other connections that were inîuenced by the connection ZKP is deìned in relation with classes of sampling-based aggregate information The class of sampling-based aggregation represents our tolerance for information release For example we can say that we are only comfortable to release the average age of a population computed on a   n random sample ZKP uses the notion of a simulator from zeroknowledge and says that a simulator with the acceptable aggregate information can essentially compute whatever an adversary can compute by accessing the result of the mechanism W e describe ZKP in the follo wing using a setting of graphs Let G be a graph We denote by G  a graph obtained from G by removing a piece of information for example an edge G and G  are called neighboring graphs  Let San be a mechanism that operates on a graph G the complete database and computes a sanitized answer to a query The adversaryês goal in a privacy scenario is to gain information about private matters of individuals nodes or connections edges in G using this released sanitized answer Let Adv  San  G  z  denote the output of the algorithm that an adversary employs to breach privacy The adversary can interact with mechanism San and may have access to some auxiliary information z  The information in z is considered to be general and easily accessible e.g information about the structure of the network graph or the groups that individuals belong in Let agg be a class of randomized algorithms that rst select k  k  n  random samples nodes without replacement from G   and then compute some aggregate information Such algorithms output an approximate answer to the query Let Sim  the simulator be an algorithm We denote by Sim  T  G   z  the information that the simulator can compute given the aggregate information computed by a T  agg k  In plain language imagine Sim to be a person who can be extremely smart and capable ESC and who has access to aggregates computed by the algorithms of class agg on the database where the sensitive information has been removed Also assume that the simulator also has access to background information z  On the other hand imagine the adversary to be a person who is also ESC and has access to San  G  as well as background information z  ZKP assures an individual that the participation in the network does not jeopardize her/his privacy ZKP provides this guarantee by sanitizing the query answers such that the information that the adversary could extract from the output sanitized answer is computationally indistinguishable from the information that could be computed using samplingbased aggregates calculated on the network data that misses the individual of interestsês sensitive information That is the adversary is not better off than some simulator even though he has access to the output of mechanism San computed on the whole database Deìnition 3 Zero-Knowledge Privacy 14  The mechanism San is  zero-knowledge private with respect to agg if there exists a T  agg such that for every adversary Adv  there exists a simulator Sim such that for every G every z  0  1    and every W  0  1    the following hold Pr  Adv  San  G  z   W   e   Pr  Sim  T  G   z   W  Pr  Sim  T  G   z   W   e   Pr  Adv  San  G  z   W  where probabilities are taken over the randomness of San and Adv  and T and Sim  By this deìnition ZKP guarantees that any additional information that an adversary can obtain about an individual by having access to the output of the mechanism is virtually not more than what can be computed by a simulator using some sampling-based approximate aggregates even without access to the mechanism and the sensitive data Note that the selection of k  the number of random samples in agg algorithms is very important and it should be chosen so that with high probability very few of the nodes connected with the node whose information has to be private will be chosen We will often index agg by k as agg k to stress the importance of k  To satisfy the ZKP deìnition a mechanism should use k  o  n  say k   n or k  3  n 2  where n  the number of nodes in the database is sufìciently large see  DP is a special case of ZKP where k  n  As it will be illustrated in the upcoming sections the speciìcations of algorithm T  agg  e.g sample size are only used to compute the level of privacy needed in the ZKP mechanism We stress that the ZKP mechanism is the only algorithm applied on the data The simulator is only an abstract notion Achieving ZKP Let f  G  R m be a function that produces a vector of length m from a graph database For example given G G  S  f produces the results of the S GS functions i.e w on edges We consider the L 1 Sensitivity to be deìned as follows Deìnition 4  L 1 Sensitivity For f  G  R m the L 1 sensitivity of f is  f  max G  G   f  G    f  G    1 for all neighboring graphs G  and G   Another essential deìnition is that of sample complexity Deìnition 5 Sample Complexity 14  A function f  Dom  R m is said to have     sample complexity with respect to agg if there exists an algorithm T  agg such that for every D  Dom we have Pr   T  D   f  D   1     1   T is said to be a     sampler for f with respect to agg  599 


This deìnition bounds the probability of error between the randomized computation approximation of function f and the expected output of f  Basically functions with low sample complexity smaller  and   can be computed more accurately using random samples from the input data When the released information as typical is real numbers the ZKP mechanism San achieves the privacy by adding noise to each of the numbers independently Let Lap    be the zero-mean Laplace distribution with scale   and variance 2  2  The scale of Laplace noise in ZKP is properly calibrated to the sample complexity of the function that is to be privately computed The following proposition expresses the relationship between the sample complexity of a function and the level of zero knowledge privacy achieved by adding Laplace noise to the outputs of the function Proposition 1 Suppose f  G   a b  m has     sample complexity with respect to agg  Then mechanism San  G  f  G   X 1 X m   where G  G  and X j  Lap    for j 1   m independently is ln  1    e  f      e  b  a  m   ZKP with respect to agg  V Z K P M ECHANISM FOR G RAPH S UMMARIZATION In this section we design a ZKP mechanism to release a graph summarization Let G G  S  S  E S  be the S graph for a graph G Let f be a function that takes a graph G G  S as input and produces c  S 3 E S  numbers or differently said a c dimensional vector corresponding to w 1 and w 2 aggregates for the groups and the connecting edges Let f  f 1 f t  be the vector or subvector that is to be privately released We apply a separate San i ZKP mechanism for i  1 t   to each of the elements of f  Let us assume that each San i provides  i ZKP for f i with respect to agg k i  where k i  k  n  t and n   V   Then based on the following proposition f will be   t i 1  i  ZKP with respect to agg k  n   where k  n   t i 1 k i  Proposition 2 Sequential Composition Suppose San i for i  1 n  isan  i ZKP mechanism with respect to agg k i  Then the mechanism resulting from composing 1 San i s is   n i 1  i  ZKP with respect to agg   k i   In this paper we consider edge connection privacy We note that node privacy will not be considered in this work since as it is widely considered cf 20 it results in too noisy output with practically no utility A Edge Connection Privacy Consider G G  S and G G  e  S  where G G  e  S is a neighboring graph of G obtained from G by removing edge e  In the edge privacy scenario the total number of nodes groups and the size of each group are identical in G G  S and G G  e  S  Therefore 1 A set of computations that are separately applied on one database and each provides ZKP in isolation also provides ZKP for the set the sensitivity of any w 1 function including the ones in f is zero that is  w 1   On the other hand removing an edge in G can change by at most 1 the numerator of each element x  y  and z in w 2 measures of G G  e  S  Note that this change affects only one w 2 measure in the whole graph G G  e  S  Therefore the sensitivities of the elements of any w 2 function including the ones in f  are  w 2  x   1 r  w 2  y   1 r 2  w 2  z   1 r where r is the minimum group size in S  In the following sections the ZKP mechanisms are separately designed for w 1 and w 2 functions in f  1 ZKP Mechanism for w 1  Suppose w 1  g  is an element of f  where g is a group in G G  S Let San  w 1  g  Lap    be a ZKP mechanism which adds random noise selected from Lap    distribution to the output of w 1  g  in order to achieve ZKP Our goal here is to come up with the right  to achieve a predeìned level of ZKP Based on the deìnition of ZKP one should rst know the sample complexity of the w 1 function For this without change in semantics we will express w 1 so that it computes an average rather than a fraction of two counts Then using the Hoeffding inequality cf we compute the sample comple xity of w 1  Expressing w 1  We assume that in addition to the regular node attributes if any we have S new boolean attributes one for each possible group We denote these new attributes by uppercase B s indexed by the group id A node v in graph G will have B g  v  if v belongs to group g  and B g  v   otherwise We have that Proposition 3 w 1  g   v  V B g  v   V   Therefore w 1  g  can be viewed as the average value of attribute B g over all nodes in G  ZKP Mechanism Let G  V E  be a graph enriched with boolean attributes as explained above We would like to determine the value of  0 for Lap    distribution which is to be used to add random noise to a w 1  g  measure included in f  For this rst we compute the sample complexity of w 1 to be able to use Proposition 1 and establish an appropriate value for   Let T be a randomized algorithm in agg k  the class of randomized algorithms that operates on an input graph G To randomly sample a graph G  algorithm T uniformly selects k  k  n  t random nodes from V  reads their attributes and retrieves all the edges 2 incident to these k sample nodes 3 From the sampled nodes and their incident edges with other sampled nodes we consider G G   S   S   E  S   Then T approximates the value of w 1  g  using G G   S   Since we have expressed 2 Clearly only non-dangling incident edges whose both end nodes have been sampled will be retrieved 3 For other possible methods of graph sampling see for example 600

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
