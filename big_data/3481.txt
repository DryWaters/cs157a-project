ETL-MR Approximate-Join Harmonization Incremental ETL Map-Reduce BigData 
I I NTRODUCTION Interest in big data analytics is growing rapidly within many enterprise IT organizations as they are being called upon to ingest process and extract business insights from ever of data which is arriving far more than before and from many such as social media mobile devices and sensors In recent years a new collection of data management tools have emerged from the web companies in particular from Google Yahoo and Facebook The Hadoop open-source platform comprising of 
larger volumes rapidly new sources 
the distributed le system HDFS the HBase no-SQL database and a distributed programming framework based on Googleês MapReduce paradigm has come to represent the larger set of similar tools which are increasingly being referred to as big-data technologies As has been demonstrated by many of the web companies the ingestion storage and deep analytical processing of large-scale data sets using statistical machine learning and data mining techniques are often more efìciently performed using these new big-data technologies as compared to traditional business intelligence platforms built on relational databases However in order to extract valuable business insights from such diverse information feeds using deep analytics data from multiple often unrelated sources rst needs to 
be 
and reduced to a common level of granularity Further the many valuable insights result only when data from new big data sources is fused with data from within the enterprise Moreo v er  the latter currently resides mainly in traditional relational databases As a result business intelligence BI platforms based on relational databases are being increasingly challenged by the need to ingest and process vast volumes of data from new big data sources together with more traditional data from inside the enterprise Consequently BI is becoming dominated by Extraction-Transformation-Load ETL processes 
correlated external internal 
and correlation in many real-life scenarios involving disparate data sources We formally describe this as the 
that consume about 70 of BI resources and effort 3 when engineered using a traditional BI technology stack On the other hand if we accept that deep analytical tasks that follow ETL processing are probably best performed using big-data technology it makes sense to apply the same big-data technology to the ETL process as well In this paper we describe our practical experience of applying big-data technology to some real-life enterprise ETL scenarios by exploiting recent research results published in the literature We motivate the need for approximate incremental data harmo

problem We describe a technique for correlating keys between different data sources using machine learning resulting in what we call  The MapReduce MR paradigm is well-suited for ETL jobs In this paper we describe ho w to implement ETL on map-reduce and optimize the application of multiple constituent operations in a sequence Further we show how to incorporate data-sets arriving at disparate times and so produce more real-time business intelligence The paper is organized as follows We begin with an overview of enterprise BI and formally describe the

problem in Section II In Section III we describe a real-life case study where data harmonization was required In Sections IV and V we describe our technique to address the problem Using map-reduce for ETL and real-time data harmonization and machine learning for correlation of incongruous join-keys Then in Section VI we describe how these techniques are combined to solve the data harmonization problem in the real-life example for which we also provide implementation details and experimental results of our solution on a Hadoop cluster Finally we conclude in Section VIII after a brief description

of related research work in the area of and in Section VII II O VERVIEW The typical ow of data in enterprise BI is that of online analytical processing OLAP which begins with the extraction of data from source i.e transactional systems into a staging area Once all relevant transactions for a speciìed time period have been recorded in their respective source systems and extracted into the staging area data is transformed into a Star or Snowîake schema and loaded into the enterprise data-warehouse through an ETL  Extraction-Transformation-Load process ETL jobs extract data cleanse it transform it to t in the target schema denormalization and aggregation and then load data into the warehouse A key assumption in such ETL processes is that dimensional data is congruous and can be correlated with the help of master data e.g product-code to product-name mapping which can be used as a dimension table in a star or snowîakes schema Data obtained from disparate systems is often found to have dimensions with different schemes of representation because of which it is difìcult to correlate and fuse such data-sources In some cases the different schemes of representation may refer to different units of measurement e.g sales being reported on basis which are to be fused with inventory status or with survey-data reported  In another case the schemes of representation may refer to different levels of granularity e.g product category vs product-name Even when data elements from different sources refer to the same dimension they still often use different encoding schemes We call such data as  In the case of internal data sources such incongruity arises due to the absence of common enterprise reference data However when data sources include external feeds such as social media incongruous data is inevitable The problem of incompatible data encoding is found to be widespread when trying to fuse survey-data and social media data with data from transactional systems Both consumers as well as eld surveyors tend to refer to product-names or store-names with their popular names instead of their corresponding Stock Keeping Unit SKU names or Store-Code as used in the transaction systems It is therefore imperative to transform the dimensions and measures to a common scheme of representation before data from disparate sources can be fused i.e before a operation is possible We deìne as We achieve dimensional transformation of incongruous data arising due to disparate encoding schemes by rst creating a mapping-ìle that forms the basis for data correlation Figure 1 CPG Case Study Schema Details As shown later in this paper such a mapping relation can sometimes be from the data itself using supervised machine learning we call this  Once such a mapping is available we transform data to a common scheme of representation via basic transformation constructs and then join these transformed data-sets to create harmonized data through ETL on MapReduce III CPG C ASE S TUDY In this section we present a real-life enterprise case study from our experience A consumer-packaged-goods company receives point-of-sale data from various retailers as well as retail metrics collected through manually conducted sample surveys Figure 1 shows the schema of the four input sources and of the harmonized data with dimension columns marked in bold columns underlined contain both dimension and measure information All these data-sets are described below  This data is collected at the checkout counter of retail stores consolidated for one week and is collected from all the stores that the CPG company supplies its products to It contains SKU Stock Keeping Unit a code for each unique product for sale in a store Store and UnitsSold for four weeks of a month  This and the next two data sets are obtained from a eet of surveyors who visit stores to conduct surveys SOS data indicates what share of the total number of shelves in a store or of a section of the store is given to each product or product category  Out of Stock data indicates whether or not an SKU was available for sale in a store on the date of a surveyorês store visit  This data contains a set of survey questions such as is visible from

main entrance along with their answers The questionanswer pairs are associated with product-names or product categories as observed in given store on the date of a surveyorês store visit These disparate data sources were to be joined into one harmonized format so that the key performance indicators such as units sold or total sales are stored at a weekly level together with possible lead measures that might impact sale such as SOS or OOS it is required to harmonize all the above data-sets into one schema Statistical analysis on such historical data can then possibly discover temporal correlations such as the probability with which a drop in share-of-shelf SOS results in a drop in sales by what factor and after how much time lag Since survey-data is manually entered and comes from multiple provider agencies product and category names rarely match between data sources and can also vary over time even from the same source In actual practice the scenario is even more complex when it is required to interpolate between sparsely collected data-points e.g if the survey-data is not collected from one of the stores it can required to extrapolate across similar stores or if the social-media data could not be collected from some of the regions requiring us to extrapolate across similarly behaving regions IV I NCREMENTAL D ATA H ARMONIZATION We rst describe data harmonization in batch-mode assuming the data from disparate systems has already arrived and then motivate need for  followed by a detailed description of how the data can be harmonized in mode Once data from disparate sources is available the data can be harmonized following a three phase process The phases are Annotation\(A Transformation\(T and Join\(J we also refer to this as the ATJ process In the annotation phase we map the columns of the input data with the column speciìcations given in an annotation-ìle pre-created In the Transformation step multiple transformations are applied on all input data-sets so as to bring them all into a common scheme of representation The transformations include standard ETL processing such as cleansing and validation schema alteration pivot un-pivot and dimension and measure transformations Dimension transformation performed through a left outer-join with a mapping le converts the input dimension values to target scheme of representation The mapping les are created using soft-key-correlation which leverages machine-learning to create these mappings and is described in Section V Such transformations need not be one-to-one and are often many-one e.g SKU to product-category or many-one e.g approximating selected metrics across multiple similar stores Measure transformation corresponds to addition of newer derived columns in the data such as weekly gain/loss in sales which are used for predictive modelling Once all transformations are complete a fullouter join is performed on the common keys of all the datasets to obtain the harmonized data In most enterprise operations input data for harmonization does not arrive at the same time even for the same time-period Therefore data needs to be stored in a staging area and can be harmonized after all the data for a speciìed time-period has arrived This delay could be avoided if harmonization could be performed incrementally i.e by harmonizing data as soon as it arrives However there are challenges in doing this we list those challenges below and then describe our approach for data harmonization If data from only one source arrives for a time-period we could harmonize and store it in the target database Later when data from another source arrives we might delete the incompletely harmonized data and harmonize both the data-sets all over again join them and then store in the target-database This approach poses problems For a large enterprise typically all the jobs are pre-scheduled and all 24 hours of a day are pre-booked If all ETL jobs were to run many times for the same time period it may become difìcult to manage the ETL schedules given xed computing resources Secondly data deletion from the warehouse is not usually recommended by administrators except for archival purposes as it requires re-indexing of large volumes of data We suggest that instead of re-joining the entire data both new and old newly arrived data is only transformed i.e not joined For merging the transformed new data with previously harmonized data a of data should be scanned and efìciently retrieved from the previsouly harmonized data The transformed new data should then be joined with this subset of old harmonized data and afresh in the target database with a suitably higher version number This incremental harmonization is carried out in ve phases 1 Annotation 2 Transformation 3 Scan 4 Join and 5 Index This scheme is implemented using map-reduce resulting in what we call the ATSJI procedure A high level data ow diagram for incremental data harmonization ATSJI is depicted in Figure 2 the numbers alongside the arrows indicate data ow sequence Only one of the candidate data-sets for harmonization ows through a particular stage at any point of time However many incremental new data-sets can be processed in parallel in a pipelined manner Also an instance of the framework itself works in a ditributed manner on a cluster of machines  A set of annotation les is created for the data harmonization task One le for each of the input data containing its column speciìcations and one le containing column speciìcations of the harmonized data These les are used by subsequent stages of the procedure  The input data is transformed into the output schema assigning to the measures that are

measures in the output schema and only of the measures are reported in the current data-set even then all 10 measures are included in the transformed data marking the remaining measures as  We perform dimension transformations through a left outer join with the corresponding mapping le\(s These joins convert the input data from one tuple to many tuples many to one or occasionally a one-one transformation In addition the many-to-one transformation requires aggregation and one-to-many transformation requires apportioning of corresponding measure columns for example daily sales data needs to be aggregated to weekly sales data and share-of-shelf data needs to be apportioned to individual products Another type of transformation involves pivot or un-pivot operation which causes a reduction or increase in the number of tuples respectively After transformation the data ows to both scan and join phases  We aim to process chunks of data as they arrive rather than wait until all the data is available As a result some incoming data records may need to be joined with records processed in earlier iterations In our case-study for example data from some stores might arrive after the rest or share-of-shelf data might arrive later than point-of-sale data etc Therefore in ATSJI once we transform newly incoming data we need to previously harmonized data for records that may to be joined with the freshly transformed data Such a scan is performed using a Group Range Index table as depicted in Figure 3 which is itself created  updated in previous iterations of ATSJI as we describe later in this section for the moment assume we Figure 3 Group Range Index in ATSJI have such a table Further this is a relatively small table and can therefore be easily loaded into mapper For scanning and indexing we require that harmonized data is grouped according to out of its dimensions In our case study for example the dimensions might be week and region The assumption is that data will arrive in sets of chunks each for a given week and set of regions Note we do assume that data even of the same type such as point-of-sale for a particular week or region arrives together However the choice of dimensions should be such that it is highly likely that each incoming data-set contains relatively chunks if grouped in this manner As depicted in T2 in Figure 3 data is grouped on rst two dimensions D1 and D2 The Group Range Index shown as T3 in the gure stores the minimum e.g w7,xyz,#322,Delhi and maximum w7,xyz,#724,York values of the primary key in the harmonized data for each combination of the grouping keys so that after a lookup of maximum and minimum values of the primary key it becomes possible to do range scan on the primary key of harmonized data In the stage of ATSJI map tasks lookup the Group Range Index in parallel for each group present e.g w7 xyz in the freshly transformed incoming data to nd the range of keys in the previously harmonized data that are guaranteed to contain records that share key-values with the incoming data set Note these ranges may contain data than is needed for example the incoming data may be only for a few stores yet the range scan for a week and region will return data for stores in the matching region and week Multiple map tasks retrieve the required subsets

as many range scans as the number of groups in an incoming data-set and at best no scans If no incoming group has a matching record in the Group Range Index this indicates that the fresh data set is completely new i.e no data for any incoming weekregion pair has previously been harmonized Next the freshly transformed as well as matching subset of previously harmonized data are inputs to the join stage A full outer join is performed between all the incoming data and the matching subset of harmonized data Note that the values of any measure columns already present in the matching subset are replaced with new measures as computed by the join Most importantly the output of the join stage is always into HBase data store Thus even if partially harmonized data was previously present fresh data is inserted against the same key which is easily possible since HBase merely maintains a new of such records and no updates are performed It is this property that makes HBase an efìcient choice for such incremental harmonization On the contrary in traditional relational databases updates are costly and which is why one never updates a data warehouse  After an incoming dataset is harmonized and stored in the warehouse the Group Range Index is updated using an additional map-reduce phase As can be explained using Figure 3 starting with input data in T1 we group by dimensions as in T2 Here total number of dimensions in the data We then nd minimum and maximum values of the primary keys for each such group which requires map-reduce to create T3 Data of this table T3 is then inserted or updated in the Group Range Index table V S OFT K EY C ORRELATION Recall the challenge of matching keys when data is represented differently across data sources such as two different codes Lt Coffee Can 100 and Light Coffee Can 100 gms both referring to the same SKU stock-keeping-unit We refer to this problem as  which is similar to the approximate join problem In contrast to approximate joins where UDFs user deìned functions are used to compare entity-names during execution of join we rst generate the mapping les which are then used by the ATSJI framework for data harmonization As shown in Figure 4 we start with a set of labeled pairs taken from data sources of a given harmonization problem to serve as a training set for supervised learning Mismatch between entity-names may arise due to typographical errors abbreviations different order of words partial words omission of unimportant words and combinations of these possibilities e.g Lt Coffee Can 100 Light Coffee Can 100 gms  D Cofee Pkt 500 Dark Coffee Packet 500 gms  We submit that there is no single similarity metric that applies to all the problems and neither is it easy for a developer to judge which metrics or thresholds to use as these are datadependent For example a metric like Jaccard similarity is helpful when the position of words in a string is irrelevant for matching JaroWinkler takes care of typographical errors and TF-IDF based metric assigns weights to words according to their importance We used similarity scores of overlap coefìcient Jaccard similarity cosine similarity soft TFIDF Monge Elkan Jaro Winkler Soundex and other metrics mentioned in as   Since some of the features are more important than others in a given problem-set we drop features that correlate poorly with the labels in training set For this we calculate statistical correlation between labels and the features Subsequently absolute values of these scores are normalized and are referred as  We traverse these features in descending order of their weights and drop all un-traversed features if the difference between weights of two consecutive features is above a prior-threshold  or if the absolute value of a feature-weight is below another prior-threshold   We use a SVM to learn a discriminative statistical model from the training set against the selected features This model is then used for classiìcation of all the pairs of strings into matching or non-matching categories These mappings are stored in a le which has been referred to earlier in Section II-A i.e the  VI I MPLEMENTATION AND R ESULTS Data from the CPG case study presented in section III was harmonised via data transformations implemented in map reduce as follows  SKU names present in the POS data need to be cleansed and then UnitsSold for various weeks of a month needed to be un-pivoted Transformation sequence is

cleanse and un-pivot When executed using PIG these were merged to one map-reduce job automatically  Product names reported in this dataset do not match with SKUs sometimes have typing mistakes and some of these correspond to shelf names and not the product names All the shelf names need to be transformed to SKUs We took transformation sequence as  Many-to-One  for survey date to week number of the year and One-to-Many for Shelf name to SKU Note If there are records in raw SOS data One-to-Many operation explodes the data times  and Many-to-One operation reduces by a factor of   It is therefore preferred to perform the Many-to-One prior to One-to-Many so that subsequent map-reduce jobs deal with smaller amount of data We performed two experiments for SOS transformation one with Many-to-One rst and second with One-to-Many rst In both of these cases PIG merged the two operations into one map-reduce job However the communication cost of these experiments can be calculated as and respectively This was corroborated by the experiments performed It took 78 seconds for rst experiment and 274 second for the second experiment for one month of data where-in and   SKU names need to be transformed to the same scheme as used in POS data and survey date needs to be transformed to week number of the year  These are miscellaneous inputs as entered by survey staff i Colloquial product-names are used just as in the case of SOS so a similar soft-key-correlation-based transformation to a canonical form is required ii A new pivot column needs to be created for every question in the Questions column For example after pivoting an entry such as is visible from main entrance in the Questions column becomes a new column taking values yes or no Both these operations can be implemented in a single mapreduce phase if they are applied in the optimal sequence i.e pivot followed by dimension transformation We have used the Hadoop platform and PIG language to implement Incremental ETL-MR We augmented the native PIG library through user deìned functions and wrote PIG script templates for modeling constructs The actual PIG scripts that implement our technique are generated from these generic templates and a data harmonization speciìcation particular to a set of data sources captured as an XML model Incoming data is rst loaded into HDFS and PIG scripts for the ATSJI framework is invoked to harmonize the data The harmonized data as well as the Group Range Index is maintained in HBase Output schema details and mappingrelation les are stored in distributed cache of Hadoop 1 for local access to various computing nodes in the cluster HBase maintains the data in Key Value Version format 1 http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html Figure 5 Batch ATJ vs Incremental ATSJI therefore we only need to insert to HBase even if a key is already present in which case the inserted record is stored as a new version of the old data As a result we never need to delete any data from HBase Finally since HBase is a distributed database we were able to have many nodes writing  reading in parallel which is normal in map-reduce but also came in useful for the scan stage of ATSJI For the purpose of this paper we generated suitably constrained but random data for the CPG case-study described in section III The sizes of different data sets used are as follows POS data had 0.42 GB for 4.16 million rows SOS data had 0.68 GB for 7.5 million rows OOS data had 0.76 GB for 7.5 million rows and LIS data had 1.3 GB for 11.2 million rows We used a Hadoop cluster of ve machines with Intel Xeon 1.87GHz CPU\(4 4 Cores and 32GB RAM each All these nodes were mounted in the same rack and connected through a single switch To study the additional cost of repeated harmonizations and range scans when harmonization is done incrementally using ATSJI harmonization was performed for six months each time in four increments assuming that different data sources e.g POS SOS etc arrive at different times in the same month The dimensions as required by ATSJI were chosen to be and  the rationale being that data from each source itself often arrives in bits and pieces for a few regions over a given time period Figure 5 demonstrates two scenarios First when the data is harmonized in batch mode marked as ATJ In this case harmonized data can be generated only after all the required data-sets POS SOS OOS and MISC have arrived The second scenario is that of ETL-MR where data is harmonized as soon as it arrives Thus if data arrives in four different batches it is harmonized four times Even then as shown in Figure 5 the cumulative cost of four incremental ATSJI harmonizations is only 2.5 times that of the single batch ATJ procedure i.e not four times

Additionally the time required to harmonize each increment is less than the time required when using the ATJ batch process even with the overhead of the scan stage and can sometimes be as much as 30 40  lower as in the case of POS OOS and SOS data To analyze effectiveness of feature selection and SVM classiìer proposed in section V we considered two data sources Point-of-Sale data POS S  and Share-of-Shelf data SOS S  In S product-name dimension is represented in terms of Stock Keeping Unit Names  SKU P  whereas in S the same dimension is represented as product category name P  Note Here P denotes the set of unique elements in the product-name dimension for data source S  We needed to generate a mapping le between S P and S P  so as to transform S and S to a common scheme of representation There is many-to-one relationship between P and P  The strings used as SKU name can typically be broken into many a sub-strings which allude to product category name size quantity in the pack weights etc i.e the product-category names are usually included in SKU name but often abbreviated through rst few characters of product category name or using phonetic codes generated by removing vowels etc This clearly involved cases where mapping the elements of P to that of P required multiple string similarity metrics and no single metric could map all the elements with high accuracy  see Figure 7 A random subset from the cross product of P1 and P2 was used as training-set and the remaining pairs as test-set to build classiìcation model and to test its accuracy respectively Here and  where is the cardinality of set  Two of the 13 features generated were found to have weaker correlation with the output-labels matching and non-matching than all the other features These were discovered by using t  0.3 prior-threshold for difference and t  0.1 prior-threshold for weight see Figure 6-b Further this was corroborated by the results shown in Figure 6-a where it can be observed that these two features could not improve the F1 score Figure 7 shows the maximum F1 score taken from precision-recall curve for some of the important metrics and that of combined metric for the 11 chosen features It can be observed that the combined metric improves the F1 score of the best performing single metric by approximately 35 Further the Gaussian-kernel-based SVM classiìer built on all the chosen 11 features performs much better than SVM without kernel To summarize soft key correlation was able to match product-category names with 91 accuracy VII R ELATED W ORK Incremental ETL has been attempted but only for reference data by keeping a log of all changes performed Figure 6 a Comparison of features weights b F1 score Vs number of features used adding features one at a time in decreasing order of their weight Figure 7 Maximum F1 scores for different metrics and then updating those in the warehouse Unlike ATSJI framework most of the real-time ETL solutions do not deal with a situation where new data needs to be rejoined with already transformed data they prescribe only the insertion of new transaction data into the warehouse Incremental ETL problem described in this paper is very different from the incremental map-reduce performed on data-set that is pushed again onto a map-reduce based system after some amendments or modiìcations as described in  Here by incremental ETL we indicate a process of onarrival data harmonization which gets called as soon as data from a source arrives and performs the transformation of the newly received data only instead of repeated transformation of previously received data along with the new data Approaches similar to our scan stage of ATSJI have been successfully used when extraction of data is performed from a warehouse to load into data-marts W e ha v e implemented ATSJI including the scan stage for a special class of ETL on HBase and have also reported its overhead as compared to a purely batch ETL However these do not include support for the full range of ETL transformation

operations as we do There are two lines of work similar to our work on soft-key correlation one focusing on providing approximate join theta join in databases and the other focusing on learning an adaptive similarity metric suitable for string matching applicable across domains Gravano et al in  describe ef cient approximate join by augmenting the database with positional q-grams tables and then using simple SQL queries but the approach does not provide adaptive metric capability Adaptively combining distance metrics has been proposed for the name-matching task and duplicate record detection in 13 14 proposes to learn rules for similar objects identiìcation by using similarity scores of attributes as antecedents of the rules In a fuzzy match similarity function has been proposed to nd k closest records to a given record combining the ideas of edit distance cosine similarity and IDF based weights Approximate key-matching features are also available in data integration packages such as the open-source Talend 2 tool where it goes by the name fuzzy match and uses single similarity metric with user deìned threshold for matching Our approach however combines soft-key correlation with map-reduce-based data harmonization which is novel VIII C ONCLUSIONS We have formally deìned Data Harmonization a commonly arising business scenario where data from disparate and incongruous sources need to be correlated We have then shown how data harmonization can be accomplished as a formally deìned ETL process using the map-reduce programming paradigm and correlation We have further shown how this can be achieved  minimising staging delays as data arrives in bits and pieces We have described performance results of a motivating example and case study We also analyzed related work in this domain and have submitted that our approach to achieve incremental outputs is novel especially in the context of enterprise BI and ETL procedures that efìciently exploit map-reduce and related BigData tools such as HDFS and HBase R EFERENCES  G Shrof f P  Agarw al and L De y  Enterprise information fusion for real-time business intelligence in

In this Section and in Section 5 below, for the more general community, we review the noise modeling process in the TIMS context. This will involve some symbols and equations, most are defined below in Table 1  For the signal radiance  R sig  the quantity  the number of photons absorbed per pixel per integration time is   P A/P R sig A D  1/hc  INT    and we define the radiance to photons conversion factor   to simplify     1 The shot noise in photons absorbed per pixel per integration time   due to the number of signal photons absorbed by the detector follows from equation \(1\d is given by         And in radiance units the absorbed signal photon shot noise is           2 and this defines the parameter R 1 1/F R P T SYS such that  such that R sig sqrt\(R 1 R sig portant for the TIMS noise analysis is the shot noise  that is due to instrument emitted thermal photons that are absorbed by the detector Other less important noise sources include the read noise  digitizer noise and dark current noise  The total noise  is given by         3 To further develop the unimportance of read, digitized and dark current noise for TIMS: to test the effects of these alone an opaque disc was placed on the cold filter mount see Figure 2\ to close off the FPA view of room temperature  photons entering through the dewar window. In this case only the read, digitizer and dark current contributed to the observed noise which was the order 6 to 8 equivalent counts.  This only a very small contribution to the noise observed in the DU 2008 campaign data that we discuss below in Section 5  5  A PPLICATION OF THE MODEL FOR ANALYSIS OF  THE 2008 DU CAMPAIGN TIMS DATA  As discussed in Sections 1 and 3 the data obtained in the DU campaign on the morning of 30 May 2008 are the best available for validation of the noise model developed above These data consist of a comprehensive set of darks \(D dark+black body \(DB\d dark+solar diffuser \(DS\a as needed to produce calibrated and flat fielded images of solar absorption spectra, and result by far from the best planned operations and documented data that we have available. As part of our TIMS noise model validation we will use it to replicate the observed DU campaign data numbers \(counts and the noises in these. The second part will be to validate against the noise in the flat fielded and calibrated  Table 1.

That light when dispersed is so weak that it effectively produces zero signal The measured dark counts \(darks\e to the much stronger signal of photons from the room temperature spectrometer cavity thermal that go through the relatively broad band pass of the cooled order sorting filter and on to the FPA. We know this from preliminary data obtained in our first DU campaign in 2007. The darks were so large that they caused saturation effects that confounded our attempts to obtain reasonable data. We ascertained this was because the darks were due to the mechanism as described above We mitigated this problem by adding appropriate stops to the dewar window and the on to the cold shielded within the dewar as presented in Appendix A. These were designed to suppress the darks while causing no vignetting of the scene images. This solved the problem so that we were able to get useful data in the next campaign, DU 2008 Since 2.33 \265m is on the very short wave side of the room temperature black body peak the darks are very sensitive to small changes in spectrometer temperature. For example in the average temperature in the ATC lab in the days just prior to the campaign was 72.26\260F and the mean value of the darks averaged 7400 counts; and during the campaign the average temperature of the DU lab was  75.81\260F and the averages of the darks 8500 counts. The ratio 7400/8500 BBF\(72.26\260F, 4291 cm 1 BF\(75.81\260F 4291 cm 1 where BF is the black body function of temperature and wave number. The darks scaled like the ratio of the of black body function for the two differing lab temperatures Another good example of this sensitivity is shown in Figure 13 where the weighted average of the spectrometer components temperature changed from 84.04  to 88.45 \260F over the 74 minute duration of the 2010 airship mission Specifically, the temperature scale is the weighted average temperature T AVG of the two spectrometer components measured temperatures, the Littrow mirror mount T L and the collimating relay lens mount T RL Then T AVG aT RL 1a L The value a = 0.63 provides the best fit of the model and data The points made are \(1\at   the dark background is most likely due to the black body radiation entering the dewar from the spectrometer, and \(2\at this is very sensitive to small changes in spectrometer temperature   Data collection procedures To get good statistics we collected data in sets of 25 consecutive images.

  11 The second observation that will be modeled is the noise, or standard deviation of the average counts  and  that are plotted on Figure 15.  Note STDV DB are significantly larger on the large wave number side of the Figure where the black body signal is not vignetted Here we discuss how that model is calculated. Referring to Section 4 above N MB is given by     4 The unknowns in equation \(4\ are and   These can be can be determined from the data, first we address  Since the noise in the N D and the N DB are photon absorption shot noise, the 2 cases can be used to evaluate  The number of photon absorptions A D  required to produce the count N D is defined by the equation    5 And the associated noise is given by   sqrt\(A D   6 So if the points N D and N DB are plotted in one direction and the points  and  are plotted in the other, then  is given by the slope        7 which follows from          8 Following equation \(7\e data shown on Figures 14 and 15 were used to calculate the  from the TIMS measurements. Individual pixels were too noisy to use Instead the approach was to use averages of the     and  to compute an average  as below       9 To de-emphasize the vignetted data we used averages that were weighted by N B as defined by equation \(10    10 Applying to the 260\260C data \(Figures 14 and 15\ we got the following results Table 3.

The excellent agreement in modeling the data N B is shown on Figure 14 and was obtained by applying these parameters as prescribed by equation \(4 Similar analysis to determine the two unknowns in equation 4, that is Max T SYS and P A/P/UC was conducted for the 225\260C black body data and the diffused solar data and the results for all 3 cases are shown in Table 4. Since the signal is about twice as big in the 260\260C black body case as in the other two, that case is weighted by two and the others by one in determining the weighted average.

The degradation in TIMS spectral resolution starting at about 4301cm-1 and on to larger is clear, compare to the feature near 4294.5 cm-1 for example The scatter, i.e. noise, in the TIMS data will be analyzed in more detail in the following paragraphs The observed noise for an is the standard deviation of the 25 calibrated spectra.

The solar diffuser  signal shot noise R Sig is shown there too.

The value of R TP here is consistent with our physical model of the black body light from the warm spectrometer passing through the dewar window and then through the relatively broad band order sorting filter on to the focal plane assembly Scaling the improved TIMS pe rformance to the space case 226 The TIMS study e d 17.2 C O ret ri e v a l preci s i o n  and that this would scale to 8.6% if the observations were along the doubled atmospheric path for the TIMS viewing the diffuser \(or earth surface with identical effective albedo cos\(SZA  from space and from along the LOS from the sun to the diffuser.

  14 for the data obtained in the DU campaign The result is that for a given value Cos \(SZA\he signal to noise ratio \(SNR\es improved and therefore so does the CO retrieval precision, linearly with the SNR. The following analysis shows that the improved TIMS in space as described above would achieve the same 8.6% CO retrieval with much smaller Cos\(SZA\ = 0.044 On Figure 20 we show the SNR DU for the DU campaign data plotted on the range 4280 to 4302 cm 1 for Cos \(SZA 0.38 and the SNR IT  for the improved TIMS on the entire range and for Cos \(SZA\ = 0.044.

A multi-channel space application and predicted SNR Introduction  Most useful space applications would require more than a single channel per instrument to maximize science return. In the GEO-CAPE mission for example the CO instrument requires two channels, near 2.33 and 4.68 \265m. If it is desired to retrieve O 3 there is a relatively weak O 3 band within the 4.68 channel. But the O 3 retrieval quality can be considerably enhanced by adding a 3rd channel near 9.6 265m. A 4th channel near 4.3 \265m would provide for even better retrieval by improving on the use of an a-priori climatological temperature model The TIMS design approach provides for expanding to a 4channel system. This is enabled by the two collimated regions in the optical train that can be used for dichroic beam splitting as is noted on Figure 8 The geoCARB concept A 4-channel concept that uses this TIMS design approach is shown on Figure 21. The concept is aimed at a geostationary measurement of the green house gases CO 2 and CH 4 and the source discriminator gas CO. It employs the O 2 A band near 0.76 \265m for surface pressure measurement; the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, respectively for CO 2 total column mixing ratio, and the CH 4 and CO bands in a region centered near  2.32 \265m region for total column mixing ratio of those gases  Note the difference in the input optics from the TIMS case Figure 8. The focal ratio  is fixed at about f/3 as in the TIMS case but the aperture diameter is  increased is by about a factor two in order to achieve the desired 2.7 km footprint on the earth at the sub satellite point when viewing from geostationary. The input optical group uses an upfront two mirror a-focal telescope to provide the collimated space for the pupil stop and the beam splitter to the long and short wave regions. The advantage of the reflective telescope is that it is achromatic over the relatively wide spectral region that includes the 4 channels. The two-color objective focusing groups that feed the long wave and short wave slits use an optics design approach that has been developed for the NIRCAM on The NASA JWST mission. The spectrometer designs from slit to FPAs are clones of the TIMS with similar slit, system focal ratios, focal lengths FPAs and optics layout. The details of the optics are  Figure \226 21 Four channel concept utilizing the TIMS design approach  P1016 2 Long wave side 2.065 m & 2.323 m Glare Stop Slit 0.76 1.61 2.06 2.3 m FPA EW Nadir Slit DBS Short wave side 0.76 m & 1.61 m filter 


  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two.

In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
