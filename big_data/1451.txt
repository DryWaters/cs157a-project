Sensor-based mon-\nitoring systems offer ways of continuously monitoring low\nfrequency activities, and open the door to new analytic and\npredictive applications in Smarter Cities. Such sensors generate\n“tricklets”, i.e., noisy and continuous time series. Tricklets\nare typically misaligned, non-uniformly sampled, and comprise\nlow frequency activities and recurring patterns. Storing and\nmaking sense of such data in a typical database management\nsystem is dif?cult, due to the impedance mismatch between\nclassical \(e.g., relational paper, we\ninvestigate the management of large amounts of tricklets from\nan architectural perspective, and propose MiSTRAL \(MaSsive\nTRicklets anALysis time series warehouses. MiSTRAL\nuses a dictionary based representation for tricklets that allows\nqueries to be run natively on compressed representations\nand thus to achieve the low-latency goal. The architecture of\nMiSTRAL is presented in detail in the following, along with\nearly experimental results on several Smarter Cities datasets.\nKeywords-architecture; data stream; sparse time series;\ndictionary compression; matching pursuit; query execution;\ndatabase\nI. INTRODUCTION\nUrban infrastructure providers in domains as varied as\nwater, energy, transportation, health care, or smart buildings\nare increasingly adopting smart sensor technologies to assist\nin their operations. The expectations in terms of continuous\ndata analysis and monitoring of the urban infrastructures are\nhigh, such that new methods and systems need to be built\nin order to support low-latency operations. In the energy\ndomain, for instance, the widespread installation of smart\nmeters and aggressive policies aiming for renewable energy\nproduction and energy conservation call for the monitoring\nand management of millions of sensor-generated time series\nto correctly analyze the energy load at various granularities\nthroughout the electrical grid. The installation of smart\nsensors is getting easier and less expensive, which leads\nto affordable and scalable ways of collecting information\nrelated to low or even very low frequency activities. Thus,\npotentially very large amounts of ?ne-grained information\nbecomes available for inspection. Such information is gen-\nerated as time series that we call tricklets in the following.\nStoring large amounts of tricklets opens the door to new\nopportunities in data mining and analytics, but also to new\nchallenges in terms of the data management architecture\nneeded to appropriately store and process tricklets data.\nMultiple sensitive aspects need to be taken into account in\nthis context. In terms of the design of the data management\ninfrastructure, three main problem must be tackled: 1 right encoding for the tricklets data, 2 and\n3 this paper,\nwe start by brie?y discussing the ?rst two points, before\nconcentrating on the architecture aspects.\nRegarding the ?rst point, the design of new represen-\ntations and compression mechanisms for time series is a\npopular research topic; depending on the application domain,\ndifferent representations may be preferred, for example with\nrespect to improved comparison capabilities, better knowl-\nedge extraction possibilities, or better storage ef?ciency. The\nmost important and commonly used techniques are Singular\nValue Decomposition, Fourier transforms and their rela-\ntives \(Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform,\nChebyshev, or Karhunded-Loeve Transform extensions \(Piecewise\nAggregate Approximation, Piecewise Linear Approximation,\nAdaptable Piecewise Constant Approximation     Ker-\nnel Piecewise Constant Approximation  dictionary-based\nrepresentations [4], [16]. The majority of these techniques\ntypically operate on smoothed versions of the data only\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 15\n\(obtained by removing the raw data irregularities in pre-\npreprocessing steps entire domain\ninformation in their new representation. Many techniques\naccept continuous data as input but introduce errors during\nthe discretization process. When taking data from multiple\nsensors, out-of-sync sensor clocks and network delays often\ninduce misaligned data. In addition, raw sensor values are\ntypically very noisy, and require complex data smoothing\nand cleaning techniques before being ready for analysis.\nOne particularly challenging aspect of time series data comes\nfrom the outliers, as they can be correctly labelled 


only if\napplication-dependent factors are taken into consideration.\nFrom the above points, we note that relatively complex\ntechniques and analyses are needed to correctly handle and\nrepresent tricklets data.\nConcerning the second point, i.e., ?nding the right phys-\nical storage structures, two main aspects need to be taken\ninto consideration and are brie?y discussed in the follow-\ning: storage structures to compactly represent tricklets \(2.1\nbelow 2.2 in?nite size of the input data raises\na big storage challenge. The large majority of approaches\nfocus on better compression methods with less storage\nspace requirements. More recently, concepts like stream\nwarehousing [10] also appeared. One core feature of the\ntricklets is the ordering of the data. Storing values in the\ncorrect order as well as all the times at which each piece\nof data was captured is often necessary to correctly char-\nacterize the phenomenon being studied; this is a challenge\nfor traditional storage structures, e.g., for relational tuples\nthat cannot provide dedicated support for operations on\nordered streams of values. A common solution is to use\na time series database server \(TSDS conceived\nfor processing series and provides support for many basic\noperations on time series \(e.g., for creation, update, deletion,\nreorganization, or mathematical operations on time series, or\nfor ?ltering based on speci?c patterns large binary objects database, though operations on BLOBS are known to\nbe sluggish at best, and quite limited typically \(e.g limited\nsupport for aggregation operations [22 historical processing\nof time series through operational historian applications.\nAs noted above, storing large volumes of time series in a\nrelational database poses a number of challenges; NoSQL\ndatabases such as generic key-value or wide table stores\n\(Apache Cassandra, HBase CouchDB\nor MongoDB speci?c engines like tsdb\n\(scalable Time Series Database large volumes of time series. Yet,\nthey do not go further into optimizing complex or analytic\noperations on compressed time series representations.\n2.2 Some further database systems offer speci?c support\nfor analytics Traditional data warehouses, OLAP and RO-\nLAP databases fall into this category. Netezza, for instance,\nis a data warehouse appliance specialized in optimized exe-\ncution of read-mostly and complex queries and has a special\ntime series processing module, though running analytics\ndirectly on compressed time series is not possible.\nAll the solutions presented above offer only partial an-\nswers to our problem. The core contribution of this paper\nfocuses on the third point: designing the right architec-\nture to support ef?cient analytics on large-scale, streaming\ntricklets. The architecture has to be adapted to ingest—in\nreal time—a continuous arrival of data generated at various\nrates, and to minimize communication latencies between the\ncomponents The architecture has to be able to receive the\ninput data from a large number of sensors that generate\ninformation in real time, or to dynamically load them from\nexisting warehouses. Running analytic queries that need the\nlatest generated data, historical data, or a combination of\nboth, has to be equally supported by the architecture. Many\nrelated solutions are based on batch systems like Hadoop;\nthe high latency of these solutions once integrated in real\ntime contexts is well known, however, which makes them\nunsuitable for our problem.\nMotivated by the points above, we propose in this paper\nMiSTRAL, an architecture for low latency execution of\nanalytic queries on massive amounts of tricklets. The rest\nof the paper is organized as follows. We start by reviewing\nrelated work below in Section II. We give de?nitions for the\nmost important terms used throughout the paper in Section\nIII. A detailed description of our proposed architecture and\nof its merits are presented in Section IV and V, respectively.\nThe results of the ?rst implemented prototype of MiSTRAL\nare described in Section VI. Finally, we conclude in Section\nVII.\nII. RELATED WORK\nMultiple architectures have been proposed to support\nef?cient queries of very large amounts of data, the majority\nof them being based on Hadoop’s principles. A survey on\nbig data architectures and platforms can be read in 3],\nwhile [7], [5] contain a detailed description of the history\nof big data along with big data processing challenges. One\nexample is represented by ASTERIX, a platform for big\ndata management that is based on MapReduce and Hadoop\n[2]. ASTERIX uses a parallel DBMS, has its own query\nlanguage and operations algebra Hyrack [6] is another\narchitecture for intensive data computing on large shared-\nnothing clusters of computers that is also based on Hadoop.\nDifferently from our goal, ASTERIX and Hyrack are de-\nsigned for parallel databases storing non-compressed data\nat rest, and their focus is not on optimized execution of\nanalytical queries on compressed data. TiMR is a solution\nfor running temporal analytics on big data [9]; TiMR is Map-\nReduce based, while our focus is an architecture with an\n16\noptimized database storage solution optimized for running\nany type of analytics. Muppet is another solution proposed\nfor big and fast data processing [14 Muppet is also based\non MapReduce and proposes the optimized operators Map\nand Update for processing very large amounts of data. A\nHadoop based solution for real time big data querying was\nalso recently proposed in 


19].\nDictionary Compression on Time Series: Storing data us-\ning a dictionary of symbols is a well-known technique, often\nused for example in column-store systems or in Semantic\nWeb databases \(e.g., to compactly store URIs atoms dictionary, and thus a compressed version of\nthe time series is provided.\nMultiple works proposing dictionary representations for\ngeneral time series exist [18], some also proposing dictio-\nnaries for sparse representations [1], [20], [11]. The latter\ndictionaries suit perfectly the tricklets features and can be\nsuccessfully used for the compression of tricklets data,\nsince the tricklets contain sparse and redundant informa-\ntion. Discarding the redundant information and keeping a\nrepresentation that encodes with as few bits as possible\nthe relevant elements presents many advantages \(e.g., faster\ncomparisons and less storage overhead regular and repetitive patterns with\nsmall variations around the patterns, and thus an optimized\ncompressed version is provided. The Fourier \(or wavelets\n/ splines dictionary-based\nrepresentations, where the base dictionary only contains\nsinusoids \(resp. a particular wavelet or polynomial basis numbers of base elements contained in\nthe dictionary. These relaxations enable dictionaries to be\n?ne-tuned for representing special types of signals.\nIII. DEFINITIONS AND NOTATIONS\nIn this section, we introduce the terms and de?nitions we\nuse throughout the rest of this paper.\nDe?nition 1. A time series is an ordered sequence of n\npairs of real value numbers T = {\(t1, v1 tn, vn R was registered, with\n1 ? i ? n. Timestamp t1 corresponds to the oldest registered\nvalue, and timestamp tn corresponds to the most recently\nregistered value. When ignoring the timestamps \(e.g., for\nuniformly sampled time series T ? Rn.\nDe?nition 2. A tricklet is a potentially in?nite, sparse time\nseries generated by a sensor that monitors a continuous and\nlow frequency activity.\nRemark 1. Sensor data are directly impacted by human\nbehavior, and the tricklets inherit from this feature and\npresent recurring patterns. The tricklets inherit also the\nnoisy, missing, non-uniformly sampled and misaligned fea-\nture of sensor data.\nRemark 2. Due to the in?nite size of a stream, all stream\ndata cannot be processed at once; the commonly way\nof processing a stream is by considering an observation\nwindow containing only one portion of the stream data,\nand by moving this observation window in time as data\narrive. Various types of windows and window bounds update\nmethods exist. In this paper, we consider the most common\ntype of window where the stream is cut into equally sized\nbatches, and the observation window focusing on the batch\ncontaining the most recent data. Only the elements contained\nin the observation window are processed at a given moment\nof time \(though using cached or aggregated versions of older\ndata is possible window is updated to contain this new batch\nof data.\nDe?nition 3. We call the tricklet data contained in a batch\na tricklet segment, or, simpler, a segment.\nDe?nition 4. Q is a list of analytic queries.\nRemark 3 Among the most commonly used analyt-\nics queries, we mention: correlation, sum, and aggregate\nqueries. In this paper, we focus our attention on them, but\nother analytics operations can be equally considered with\nminimal changes to our architecture.\nProblem de?nition: Given W , a stream warehouse 1 storing\ntricklets segments, and a workload of executing Q on W ,\ndesign an architecture for a system that: 1 integrating domain information, 2 the workload by executing Q on compressed\nW data whenever possible, and 4 levels, all with bounded errors.\nIV. PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE\nThis section contains the description of MiSTRAL our\nproposed architecture for answering the problem introduced\nabove. MiSTRAL can handle arbitrary times series, but it\nis especially ef?cient on tricklets, which are the focus of\nthis paper. We start with an overview of our architecture and\nthen delve into each layer and component of the architecture,\ndescribing also the data and query execution ?ows.\n1“A stream warehouse is a Data Stream Management System \(DSMS a very long history.” [10]\n17\nFigure 1. The overall architecture of MiSTRAL\nA. MiSTRAL\nThe general idea behind our architecture is to explicitly\nstore and track only the most relevant \(i.e., informative tricklets in a new optimized representation, to\nef?ciently store this new representation in a database to\nef?ciently perform queries directly on top of this optimized\nrepresentation, and to be able to access non-compressed data\nfor special queries that may require it.\nAn overview of our proposed architecture is given in\nFigure 1. MiSTRAL can function in two modes \(the\nselection is made by the Mode component depicted in Figure\n1 MiSTRAL works in\nonline mode when it is supposed to compress the data it\ningests and to prepare it for future analyses; in this case,\nthe dictionary is already known, and it is just infrequently\nupdated at special points 


in time dictated by a trigger system.\nThe of?ine mode is illustrated in Figure 1 by using the color\nblue for the data ?ow \(arrows Compression Layer , Storage Layer , and Query\nExecution Layer . Data is collected in real time in the rst\nlayer, where it is also compressed. Original data as well as\nthe compressed representation are stored in the second layer,\nwhile the data analysis takes part in the third layer. Each of\nthe layers is described in more detail in the following.\n1 data in real time from a set\nof sensors from the Tricklets Sources component, or can\nbatch-load them from disk from the Historical Tricklets\nStore component. The data is ?rst collected by the Data\nAcquisition component that is in charge of syntactically\naligning the incoming data to the data format supported by\nthe system. Data Acquisition is an in-memory component,\nand uses an Apache Kafka system, InfoSphere Streams, or\nany other system able to collect streaming distributed data\nin real time. The tricklets are splits into segments of a given\nsize \(determined by the application domain, e.g., hourly, or\ndaily segments tricklet containing one\ntricklet segment per sensor. The set of tricklet segments is\nsent to the Uncompressed Tricklet Segments Temporary Store\ncomponent, which is a store keeping the data temporarily\nwhile they are still needed for compression purposes. Only\nthe latest batch of data is stored in this way. Then, depending\non the status of the Mode component, i.e., depending on\nwhether the system is of?ine or online, two different paths\ncan be followed \(depicted in blue and black in the ?gure segments are sent\nto the Dictionary Learning component, which uses them to\nupdate the dictionary atoms. For this purpose, the latest\n18\ndictionary atoms are retrieved from the Dictionary Store\nand used to determine the new atoms that get stored into\nthe Dictionary Store . The Dictionary Store can contain\none or several dictionaries depending on the application\nneeds and the data types. One single dictionary is enough to\nstore all information; however, depending on the application\nand data types, different sparsity levels or encoding speeds\nmay be needed, hence requiring several dictionaries. Nested\ndictionaries can also be used, e.g., to support different data\nresolutions.\nWhen the system is online \(black path on the ?gure typically already learnt and the main task of\nthe Data Acquisition and Compression Layer is to encode\ndata. In this case, the tricklets segments are routed to the\nCompression \(Matching Pursuit current\ndictionaries is preloaded from the Dictionary Store compo-\nnent, and the tricklet segments get compressed on the ?y \(by\ndefault, using a matching pursuit method, but other pursuit\nmethods can be equally used we consider uniform time sampling, and,\nfor simplicity, we ignore the temporal stamp associated to\neach value in the following elements\ndepending on the situation. Let D =\n[\n?1, . . . , ?k\n]\nbe\nthe chosen dictionary with k atoms, where each atom is a\ntime series. A sparse representation S on D with a sparsity\nsp ? k is:\nS =\nk?\ni=0\nwi?i 1 wk]\nT .\nGiven a dictionary, computing the sparse representation\nof a tricklet segment is an NP-hard problem \(as is the\nproblem of encoding a signal given a dictionary by using matching\npursuit methods. Thus, encoding the tricklet segment TB\nover the dictionary D can be done by solving the following\noptimization problem:\n??sp = argminv ?vD ?

The\nDictionary Learning Trigger can be activated continuously\n\(e.g., using an approach like [15 advocate\nan extensive of?ine training of the dictionary and the usage\nof the latter option, as updating the dictionary is a time\nconsuming step and has to be performed such that real\ntime processing is not negatively impacted. The path to the\nDictionary Learning Trigger is dashed to illustrate that it\nshould be activated only at speci?c moments.\n2 data. Its purpose is to\nprovide an optimized storage solution for the temporally\nstamped tricklets data. The components belonging to this\nlayer are: Historical Tricklets Store , Uncompressed Tricklet\nSegments Temporary Store , Dictionary Store and Com-\npressed Tricklet Segments Store . The Historical Tricklets\nStore does not need a speci?c database particularly if used\nof?ine for dictionary training purpose; if used online, then\nthe component requires fast data access and retrieval. Any\nin-memory database able to store and ef?ciently retrieve\ntemporally ordered data \(tricklet segments Compressed\nTricklet Segments Store components are more sensitive, have\ntighter temporal constraints and need

The Compressed Tricklet Segments Store\nholds the compressed tricklets segments \(the compression is\nrealized by the Compression \(Matching Pursuit represents the most frequently accessed\ncomponent of the architecture \(as the majority of the analytic\noperations will be processed using the segments answer queries in\nthe compressed domain directly by the next layer whenever\npossible. The compressed tricklets can also be decompressed\nfor queries needing non-compressed representations. Dedi-\ncated database solutions for large amounts of time ordered\ndata need to be adapted for the last two components \(e.g.,\nDB2, Netezza Cassandra, TempoDB, etc analytic queries formulated by\nthe user.

Exponential decay means that for\neach further non-zero coef?cient added in the sparse re-\nconstruction, the compression error is reduced by at least\na constant factor. Simply said, the energy of the signal\nis concentrated in the ?rst coef?cients. Theoretical proof\nand studies of this phenomenon can be found in [16]. This\nfeature is extremely helpful as it allows to dynamically adapt\nthe sparsity level used for query execution or to choose\namong different accuracy levels when handling various types\nof queries.\nV. MISTRAL MERITS\nIn this section, we discuss the main bene?ts of MiS-\nTRAL.\nLarge Applicability: MiSTRAL addresses a very hot\nchallenge: the ef?cient querying of big data in motion, and\nit can be applied to various domains \(network monitoring,\nSmarter Cities applications etc is particu-\nlarly suited for tricklets data. Fourier or wavelets are just par-\nticular cases of dictionaries with less powerful compression\nand extensibility properties. The dictionaries of MiSTRAL\ncan be easily extended with atoms by simply adding them\nto the current set of atoms, a property that is not supported\nby Fourier or wavelet transforms. Another advantage of the\ndictionary based representation of MiSTRAL is that it can\nbe optimized to include domain information. MiSTRAL is\ncurrently designed to handle numerical data tricklets, but it\ncan easily be extended to handle more complex / structured\ndata \(e.g., object data tricklets using the dictionary\nbased compression method, while the majority of compres-\nsion methods need as input a timely uniformed sampled\nsignal.\nEf?cient Querying: MiSTRAL’s representation and com-\npact storage models allow to answer a number of queries\non the compressed representation directly, without requiring\nthe costly operation of reconstructing the original signal\n\(unless this is explicitly requested the query signi?cant performance improvements in terms of query\nexecution. Also, by including or dropping atoms during\nquery execution, various accuracy levels can be obtained\nwith guaranteed bounds on the error.\nRobustness: The architecture of MiSTRAL is very ro-\nbust to underlying changes in the data. Different sampling\nrates, randomly missing values, newly occurring patterns,\nor sudden increases in data rates are just a few examples\nof variations that do not affect the compression qualities of\nMiSTRAL.\nStorage and Operations Optimized Separation: MiS-\nTRAL is separated into three layers that have speci?c storage\nand latency needs each layer can use its own optimized\nstores independently, thus enabling the optimization of spe-\nci?c operations through tailored components.\nVI. FIRST PROTOTYPE EXPERIMENTS\nWe have implemented and tested a ?rst prototype of\nMiSTRAL. In a ?rst step, we trained a dictionary using\nthe of?ine mode for several datasets Then, we switched\nthe system online, and let MiSTRAL ingest batches of\ntricklet segments daily by projecting them and compressing\nthem using the dictionary. We used a single dictionary per\ndataset for this ?rst 


experiment, such that the Dictionary\nStore contained one single dictionary per dataset. We\nused an orthogonal matching pursuit \(OMP experiments.\nFigure 2 shows the Rooted Mean Square Error \(RMSE RTE France3 and ICDM\nChallenge4 indicate\nthat MiSTRAL yields much better compression rates than\nthe Fourier compression. Also, early tests indicate that\nMiSTRAL is extremely ef?cient, as it can run most queries\nin the compressed domain directly leading to orders of\nmagnitude latency improvements compared to traditional\nsystems.\nFigure 2. RMSE: MiSTRAL versus a Fourier compression\n3http://clients.rte-france.com/lang/fr/clients consommateurs/vie/vie\nstats conso inst.jsp\n4http://tunedit.org/challenge/IEEE-ICDM-2010\n20\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we proposed MiSTRAL an architecture\noptimize for executing low-latency analytics on historical\nstreams of tricklets. MiSTRAL exploits a sparse dic-\ntionary representation for effective compression, compact\nstorage, and ef?cient query execution over compressed,\ndecompressed, and non-compressed data. MiSTRAL was\ndesigned based on a generic architecture and can be applied\nto numerous scenarios and application domains. MiSTRAL\ncan be easily extended to ef?ciently handle or detect any\ntype and shape of data pattern by simply adding the pattern\nas an atom in one of its dictionaries. Various types of\nanalytics can be ef?ciently executed by MiSTRAL with\nlow latency many of them on compressed data directly. By\nincluding or dropping atoms during query execution various\naccuracy levels can be obtained with guaranteed bounds on\nthe error. A ?rst prototype of MiSTRAL was implemented\nand early experimental results indicate that the underlying\ndictionary-based compression approach brings signi?cant\nbene?ts in terms of compression ratios and query execution\ntimes. As future work, we plan to perform additional tests,\nto compare against more compression methods and storage\nsolutions, and to develop algorithms to dynamically trigger\nthe Dictionary Learning component.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

For \ninstance visa officer can check if anyone has   a criminal nrecord or finding out if someone has gone through bankruptcy \nin their history.  \nBasically dashboard shows everything that should be \nknown about anyone before entering to the country obtaining \nuseful facts before making important decisions. If there is any \nsecurity concern it will show in alert section and display as nsecurity warning alert.  \nTotal Tourist Efficiency index is reflecting the investment \ncapability of a tourist. This index makes clear how efficient a \ntourist as a whole for a purticular client.  \nTotal Efficiency Index = \(Visit Index + Health Index + \nWealth Index + LifeStyle Index Indexes are defined for group of \ntourists of same criteria. Criteria can be age, gender, country \nof residence, ethnicity etc. This is a good indicator to \ncompare individual tourist efficiency with that of the average \nof each criteria he belongs to.  \nAverage Efficiency Index = \(Sum of Total Efficiency \nIndexes of tourists \nBuying pattern is the buying frequency and amount spent in \nwhich a tourist purchase goods or services in a period of time \n \nVI. TESTING  \nOne of the major problems in much invested big data \nprojects is the lack of confidence due to non-practical results. \nTherefore a sound quality control, using standards and a nquality check with comparison testing of results with real web \nsites is very important. During the testing three dimensions \n\(volume, variety and velocity  need to be tested. Test plan has \nbeen proposed as follows;  \n \nA. Validating based on the characteristic of big data \nTesting high volume of data is very complex task and \nneeds faster approach. Testing approach needs to carry out by \nusing number of datasets sampling strategy based on the data \nrequirements. These Structured data needs to test by \ncomparing data using compare tools. Therefore data \ndiscrepancies can be identified Converted semi structured \ndata into structured format since data crawling from different \nwebsite to the dashboard it does not have defined structure to \nvalidate. Subsequently validation should carry out by ncomparing expected data with actual data. There is no define \nformat for unstructured data like social media data, web pages, \nweb log files, search indexes, e-mail, documents. It converted \ninto structured data by using Pig scripting [43] and validated \naggregated data against the data output. Performance testing \nneeds to be out in order to test data speed.  \nB. Functional Testing  \n1 During the \ntesting incorrect data can be captured when loading source \ndata files into HDFS.  Therefore it needs to initially validate \nthe data requirement and compare the input data    file and \nsource data including social data, streaming data, and \nstructured data from OLTP database. Subsequently needs to nvalidate that whether the data files are loaded into HDFS \nappropriately.  \n \n2 Coding issues in map \nreduce jobs can be occurred therefore developers needs to \nhighly concentrate to identify and fix issues. Business logic, \nData process, map reduce process, aggregation, output files \nand file format need to be validated during this phase.  \nThis solution heavily involves java code. It is important \nthat code is written according to java standards and best \npractices to ensure proper functioning of the application. Java \nunit testing of this application is out of scope.  \n \n3 storing phase: Once the data \nfrom data sources loaded in to HDFS and map reduce process \nis completed processed data will move to this phase. Data \ntransformations are very complex and it needs more \nprocessing time. Validation needs to consider in terms of data \nintegrity and data quality. Hence transformation rules and \naggregation of data needs to be validated.  \n    This solution involves inserting and selecting of data from \nNoSQL databases like Hbase. Still there are no hard and fast \nstandards and best practices for NoSQL based data operations. \nEven though it is in the very scope of this paper the time \nfactor has not enabled authors to explore much on this area. \nAuthors plan to explore standards and best practices of \nNoSQL data operations in a future research paper. \n \n4 whether the fetched data appeared as expected.   \nDashboard data and reports needs to be validate by ensuring nwhether web data are up to date and available. \nC. Non Functional Testing \nPerformance Testing is another main area authors need to \npay a lot of attention. Bigdata involves high volumes, high \nvariety and high velocity in data which is vulnerable for \nperformance issues if any of these attributes are changed 


nTherefore millions of data needs to be prepared and loaded \ninto the application and complete cycles needs to be test. Also \nas mentioned earlier there are different varieties of data. \nTherefore data needs to feed to the application in high speed \nsimulating a real world scenario where web pages will rapidly \nupdate. Any issues in performance will rectify from \napplication, hardware, network and other factors continuously \nto get real value from big data \nHDFS architecture is designed to detect and recover to \nproceed with in the processing for three common types of \nfailures including NameNode failures, DataNode failures and \nnetwork failures [44]. However validation should take place \nwhen switch over in to other data node to ensure failover ntesting.   \n \n \n \nD. User Acceptance Testing \(UAT nauthors did lot of work in preparing test specifications as this \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2  215 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer functionally fit for use and behaves as \nexpected; validate end-to-end business process, user access, \ndata availability, integrity and quality. The method of this \ntesting mainly is on comparing the end result with that of the \nsource web sites. For example let's get a person whose visit \nindex to Sri Lanka is very high Testers have to manually \naccess the web sites involved and see whether they reflect \nthese visits. Also they have to compare this with different \nusers and see whether the visit index for this user is \nreasonable compared to web published data and other users. \nIn this way all the indexes has to be tested with sample users \nand also see whether average indexes are realistic and also \nother trends are correctly shown in web nVII. DISCUSSION \nAs discussed in the paper this research was based mainly \non the end users like tourist hotels and tourist guides etc. \nTherefore it was essential that we get the feedback from them \non the solution design as well. We got their feedback mainly \nfrom the dashboard prototype which was a very good tool for nthem to get good idea on our design. \nUsers were very enthusiastic on this kind of a solution. \nTheir main worry was whether they will have to pay for this \napplication. They knew that we were based on readily navailable data in internet and some of them were already \nusing some web pages to get an idea of their tourists. So it \nwas not an easy task to convince a new application. But the \nrich interface and the comparative indexes authors designed \nwere making sense to them. After looking at the return on \ninvestment most of them were happy on this venture. \nOne of the main valid points was whether we can rely on \nweb data As they pointed out some of them had relied on \nthese web information earlier and had mixed results. Some ntourists sites were publishing genuine data where as some \nothers were publishing fake data which we also had to agree. \nTherefore what they were pointing was rather than relying on \ndata that is published by tourist themselves we have to go for \nsome independently confirmed data source, since they have to \nsubscribe also Authors pointed out the facility of integration \nwith the Department of Immigration and Emigration which nusers welcomed and were suggesting further to get integrated \nwith official authorities of countries of relevant tourist as well. \nThis was a good suggestion and authors think this is possible \nif they can get the sponsorship from government of Sri Lanka \non this venture. \nBigdata solutions mainly go hand in hand with ndatawarehousing solutions. Software companies market them \nas cheap options for datawarehousing due to the open source \nstack it uses. But penetrating into the market with this \nstrategy is difficult when there is an existing datawarehousing \nsolution. Client thinks he already has the given solution using \nthe datawarehousing data and if he has already spent on \nsoftware he may not be interested in going for a new solution. \nDue to this problems in penetrating into the market with \ndatawarehosing solutions authors came up with this novel nidea of integrating bigdata solutions to On Line Transaction \nProcessing Solutions. Rather than marketing this as a \nManagement Information System authors are proposing to get \nadditional data using this solution for front office transaction \nsystems. \n One of the main attractive points in this solution is rather \nthan working on historical data of the available databases \nauthors is going for social media to explore additional and \nindependent data. This was the main key factor in introducing \nbigdata into tourist sector as this impressed the tourist \noperators. Even though this data is known to the end user they \nreadily accepted the way authors were trying to analyze this. \n Even though bigdata is a buzzword the use of it is very \nlimited and this a practical solution design which will attract \nusers to use this technology. \nAuthors' idea was to implement this solution design before \nthe ICTer conference for the presentation. But due to other \nfull time commitments they did not have time to show a fully \nexecutable prototype of this solution. Especially both authors \nbeing database specialists it was no easy task for them to start \non a venture of a java based project. Therefore the solution \nwill be limited to the total solution design with fully tested \nhadoop and hbase components. \nWe would have validated the data files in different data \nnodes in order to complete the validating process during the \ndata crawling and scraping phrase. In the testing, we mainly \ntested standalone 


node only. Different issues may occurred \nwhen validating the map reduce process run on multiple \nnodes nVIII. CONCLUSIONS \n In this paper we proposed a solution design for a \ndashboard which is integrated with big data technologies. \nDifferent types of big data technologies were analyzed and \nidentified. After evaluating stakeholder requirement and \npossibility of implementation proposed solution were \ndesigned based on Hadoop nFour fusion logics were applied to design main index \nindicators. Index Indicators, Contextual Search Centralized \nrepository for user Meta data, Early Warning Alerts, Analytic \ntool and Reports, Marketing campaign optimization, Link \nwith social media features, Sales and marketing forecasting \nare the main functionalities will be embedded in the proposed \ndashboard.  \nThe proposed personal dashboard enriches with ncustomized features and enables end user to get summarized \ninformation about a tourist from different sources. On other \nhand it is very useful to take decisions in various aspects. The \nconcept has been applied in one of Sri Lanka’s most \nemerging industry named, travel and tourism to show the \npracticality of this technology to anybody. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nOur gratitude is expressed to Database Competency \nExcellence Group DB-CEG POC expertise coding knowledge in implementing the \nsolution. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] T.Lock \(2012 Big Data \nrevolution.[Online].Available:http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/0\n8/big_data_revolution/ \n[2 R.Henschke. \(2009  nhttp://www.asiacalling.org/en/special-reports/after-the-war-the-hard-\nwork-begins-in-sri-lanka/1441-sri-lanka calls-for-tourism-\ndevelopment-boom \n[3] J.Manyika, M.Chui, B.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
