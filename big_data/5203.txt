How to detect these attacks is an important aspect of IDS \(Intrusion Detection System\search. The correlation research in intrusion detection performs mainly on the following aspects reducing the false alert rate and omission rate; detecting unknown attacks; attack forecasting. Especially the development of the third point perhaps improves the passive detection to the active protection. Through the study on 
patterns of the multi-step attack, a model of alert correlation which is based on self-regulate is designed. This paper describes the definition and classification of alert correlation. Also it introduces the association rules. To improve efficiency of IDS,the paper applies data mining technology to IDS In the paper we present a method of how to acquire the intrusion knowledge from the logs and detect the intrusion behaviors based on the improved Apriori  algorithm Keywords-intrusion detection; alert correlation; selfregulate; Apriori algorithm  I   I NTRODUCTION   Study on the network intrusion detection system began in the 20th century, 80's, has been more than 20 years however, the development of intrusion detection 
technology, is far from the objectives and expectatio   The current intrusion detection system still face the following problems: \(1\ack of capacity for the accurate description of the attack \(2\ The IDS does not recognize the relevance of alert information, \(3\ack of visualization for the study of alert information Therefore, it is necessary to make correlation and adjustment analysis on IDS alert information, to reduce false alert rate and omission rate; to concise alert information, and provide these higher-level security information such as the strategy and process of the intrusion in a visual form to the security administrator, and predict the next possible attack, so that administrators may take timely measures to put an end to the ongoing and imminent attacks II 
 COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF S EVERAL EXISTING CORRELATION METHODS  The current commonly used correlation methods are the probability correlation method, alert correlation model of machine learning method, alert correlation methods based on the prerequisites and method based on aggregation and correlation component However, these methods have their shortcomings Probability correlation method can not find the associated information from the alert information with fewer characteristics and can not reflect the cause-and-effect relationship of the alerts.  for the Alert Correlation Model of machine learning methods, the data that does not exist in thread could not be associated with and this affects the accuracy of the final results of the analysis; The method 
based on the aggregation and correlation component has difficult in predicting intruder's behavior. Alert information associated method based on Prerequisites is only an off-line detection method, and it needs well understand for a variety of attack methods.[2  III  DESIGN OF THE ALERT CORRELATION MODEL B ASED ON S ELF REGULATE  Through the discussion of the correlation methods mentioned above, here we present an improved model: the alert correlation model based on Self-regulate. The improved model incorporates advantages of the associated component-based approach and alert information correlation based on pre-conditions A

It also includes   Source IP association: According to the attacks source IP address, the alerts are divided into some groups, the analyst can know which attack source is the most active, and if an IP address is reported by several IDS alert \(or implicitly inclusive\ as the attack source IP address, then this IP addresses has great possibility to be used by an attacker Especially when the same source IP address triggered a number of different security alert events   Destination IP association: the destination IP association is useful in identifying attack targets if a system is constantly to be reported as a target it is likely that it is actually really an attack destination   Attack type / name association: If the attacker uses multiple source IP addresses, then the IP addresses association may be invalid. At this time association with attack name or type is still very valuable   Time-based association: if the data analyst has data of several days, he may implement timebased association. If the analysts find a peak period from the time that the alerts happens which appears at a certain period of time of each day, it means that hackers maybe attack at this period of time these days 2  The Definition of Association Rules Definition 5: Let I i 1 i 2 i m is a collection of items. Task-related data set D is a collection of database transactions, where each transaction T is a collection of items, and satisfies that T 003 I set A is an item set transaction T contains A if and only if A 003 T there exist   The association rules are like implication formula A 000 B which A 002 I  B 002 I and A 004 B  005    Rules A 000 B in the transaction set D with a support degree s where s is a percentage of D  containing A 006 B that is, the probability P  A 006 B    Rules A 000 B in the transaction set D with a confidence degree c if the ration of contains A to D contains B is c the conditional probability is P   B  A That is:support A 000 B  P  A 006 B  confidence A 000 B  P  B  A  The support and confidence are two metrics respectively, reflect the usefulness and certainty of the rules. The rules that satisfy the minimum supports threshold min_sup can be expressed as Smin d the minimum confidence thresholds min_conf can be expressed as Cmin at the same time are called strong rules A collection of items called item sets. If it meets the minimum support itemset, call it frequent item sets B  Algorithm Idea Mining association rules algorithm [8  s t w o m a i n  steps to go 1  To Identify All the Frequent Item Sets Through the user given minimum support to find all frequent item sets, that is, the item set which meet the support degreer of no less than min_sup When the frequent item sets may have including relationships, to identify item sets that are not included in other frequent item set, and name it large item sets \(Frequent Large Item Set 2  To Generate Association Rules From the Frequent Item Sets With the user given minimum degree of confidence  min_con looking for association rules no less than min_con confidence in each maximum frequent set For the extraction of frequent item sets we use the Apriori algorithm. The core of it is recursive algorithm based on a two-stage frequent set. The basic idea is that firstly, generate candidate frequent item sets Lk +1 from the smaller frequent item sets Lk So again and again, until all the frequent sets are found, and the appear frequency of these items set has at least the same value as the predefined minimum support degree. And then, to generate association rules by the frequent set and these rules must meet the minimum support degree and minimum confidence degree The core of Apriori algorithm is how to generate all the frequent item sets [10 w h ich u s es an  ite ra tiv e lay e r  by layer approach, and we describe it in pseudo-code as follows Input: transaction database D minimum support threshold min_sup  Output: the frequent itemsets L in D  L1 large 1-itemsets for k 2 Lk-1 000 005  k  Ck  apriori_gen  Lk-1  min_sup  Generate the next candidate itemsets to be mined for all transactions t 037 D  Ct subset Ck,t  For all candidates c 037 Ct  c.count Lk  c 037 Ck C.count>=min_sup return L  006 Lk  Algorithm calls the function apriori_gen  Lk-1  min_sup in order to generate k candidate sets from K-1  frequent item sets. It uses the following properties: \(1\If X  is a frequent item sets, then any non-empty subset X are frequent item sets; \(2\If the X is not a frequent item set then any superset of X are not frequent item sets. Pseudocode described as follows for each item set Li 037 Lk 1 for each item set Lj 037 Lk 1 if Li   Lj 1  Li 2 Lj     Li  k    Lj  k 2  Li  k   Lj  k    c  Li join Lj Merge to Generating candidate item sets if has infrequent-subset  c  Lk 1 delete c Pruning process  else insert c to C   return C

we call infrequent_subset  c, L is to determine whether the c is needed to be added to candidate set k the algorithm is as follows for each item sets k 1\ subset s of c  if s 007 Lk 1 return TRUE return FALSE Due to the high complexity of the classic Apriori  algorithm ,for n item sets, if n is large, an alerting number of candidate item set will be generated when merging then a lot of pruning operations will be needed , and result in large memory cost  Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the algorithm. Since this raw data is based on the host log, therefore, the destination IP address is a fixed IP address of the server. Using the Apriori algorithm for IP addresses of different users, firstly, the set of logical log records are divided into disjoint blocks, consider one block once separately and generates all the frequent sets of it. Finally, calculate the final degree of support and confidence. This algorithm can be highly concurrent executed, the corresponding record for each IP address is allocated to a processor to generate the frequency set produce the rules, and finally merge all the rules, filtering out the valid set of rules. This method greatly improves the speed of handling mass data. [11   C  Construction of Function Modules Based on the above algorithm and filtered rules set we design the relevant function modules, as shown in Fig.1  1  Alert Information Pre-processing Module Different Underlying types of IDS will package set of the original alert message and sent it to the alert information pre-processing module, and alert information pre-processing module will convert different IDS alert information to uniform format \(AID, TS, AL, SI, TI StartTime, EndTime\. The parameters are stated as following AID is for the IDS number TS is  for the alert time stamp AL is numbered corresponding to the vulnerability of attack type number  using CVE numbers to unify the representation of attack type SI is for the attack source address information, including IP address and port two properties TI is as the target address information including IP address and port two properties StartTime is start time of the attack, is initialized with the value of the assignment for of the TS  EndTime is end time of the attack, is initialized as the value of the assignment for the TS  After processing large number of the original alert information set, this module will convert the standard information to establish the standard pattern data structure and save them into the files, waiting for the alert information merge module to process 2  Alert Information Merge Modules Alert information merge module [13  1 4  is  responsible for re-merging the alert information that have duplicate relations and concurrent relations into new alert information Firstly, the alert information merge module read information from the outcome document of pre-processing module, and they are classified into different target subblock according to the IP attributes of destination address information, and then are written into different files with IP as file name, respectively. And the following operations operate on each file separately The theoretical basis of this step is that the raw data is according to host-based alert logs, so the destination IP is the server IP, it is a small number. At the same time, due to the high complexity of Apriori algorithm, if all the information to be handled, the memory overhead is very large, we use disjoint sub-blocks to increase the speed of mass data processing. Because it is based on host alert logs, the distributed intrusion is less, we basically deem it as invasion from different hosts. Therefore, we improve the efficiency of algorithms at the same time did not significantly reduce the accuracy of results Then, we merge each alert log files. On the first ,we repeat the merge operation. For the two Alert information A1 \(AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time\ A2 AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time\if \(AID, AL SI, TI\as the same value, and the | A1.TS-A2.TS 001 1  001 1 is a set duplicate threshold value \ then delete the alert information A2, and set properties in the A1 as following A1.StartTime = min \(A1.StartTime, A2.TS A1.EndTime = max \(A1.EndTime, A2.TS\.The second step is to do concurrent merge operation. For the two Alert information A1 \(AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time \,A2\(AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time \, if AL,SI,TI\s the same value , and | A1.TS-A2.TS 001 2  001 2 is set concurrency threshold value\, then remove the warning letter A2, and make A1.StartTime = min A1.StartTime, A2.StartTime\, A1.EndTime= max A1.EndTime, A2.EndTime\, A1.TS = \(A1.StartTime A2.StartTime The theoretical basis of this step is the previously mentioned definition of classification of the alert associated form. Since the original alert messages has a large number of redundant alert information, which reducing the computing efficiency of the model and the time is wasted on redundant alert information processing on the other hand, the important attack alert is submerged in the redundant alerts 3  Alert Information Association Module Network intrusion behavior is often a series of attacks or combination attacks, these attacks are not isolated, but the performance of the different stages and the previous stage is to prepare for a later stage. Therefore, processes should be carried on the alert information to make the overall analysis. For example, if a hacker is going to attack a server, he would first locate the host, and launch IPSweep attacks, to determine whether there is such a host  Figure 1  alarm correlation model based on the automatic adjustment

IP\; and then launch Sadmind_Ping attacks to see if this server has Sadmind loopholes, if yes, he can take advantage of this loophole to launch Sadmind_BOF buffer overflow attacks to gain Root access. He may also have further use of the Root permissions on the server to place Trojan horses, leaving the back door and so on. In the course of hacker attacks, IDS may generate a series of alert at each stage, but it can not know the relationship between the alerts, that is to say, attack strategy can not be revealed. This module is completed to show that the correlation between the warning information, and to point out the attackers characteristic sequences This module deals with alert information that has been processed by the two modules above, using the Apriori  mining algorithm. In the process, the alert message sequence within each unit time T is deemed as an event and be calculated with AL as the primary key. Different from the usual Apriori algorithm, this algorithm divides the alert information into several disjoint subsets, with destination IP as a unit, mining separately, and then associate the correlation rules set to generate the resultscorrelation rules set IV  E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  In the experiment, we use a laboratory host as the target machine which is setup with SNORT intrusion detection system, and then using other hosts to launch XScan scanning to it. The SNORT alert log within 40 minutes received is used as a sample. . Since the alert logs are based on the same IP, so we ignore the first step in the alert message merge module operation. Total number of alert information is 84, after the merge module merging redundant information, the number of the generated quasialert information is 30, and then using 300 seconds as the event separation time, 9 alert events are produced. For the different levels of support and confidence, the generated rule sets at last are different. As shown in table I  Through the numbers in table I, we can see that the support degree has great impact on the number of rules that generated, .For the samples in this experiment support degree among 0.23 to 0.27 generate the relatively stable number of rules, in further experiments, we can select the degree of support = 0.25 as the initial support for instructions V  E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND FUTURE WORK  In this Paper, we propose an alert correlation model based on Self-regulate, aiming at solving the problems in the existing alert correlation technology. The model introduces the data mining technology into the alert correlation, and makes improvements on alert correlation technology using Apriori algorithm. By using sub-block techniques, we not only adapt to the application of alert association and also are able to significantly reduce the algorithm complexity with small affect on the accuracy of results The essence of alert correlation is to process a large number of audit log. The purpose of data mining is to identify potential, unknown knowledge from the vast amounts of data, so it has great application advantages in alert correlation field. How to use the available attack mode to adjust the appropriate mining parameters and then to select the appropriate number of representative original audit data, and how to find a better algorithm for mining these are the Future work  R EFERENCES  1  Fayyad U,Piatesky-Shapiro G,Smyth P.The KDD Process for Extracting Useful Knowledge Form Volumes of Data J  C o m m u n i c a t i on s of th e A C M  1 996  2  A grawal Retal.Mining association rules between sets of item s in large databases[A  I n P r o cee ding s o f A C M S I G M O D Co nf e r e n ce on anagement of Data[C W a s h in gt on DC M a y 1 993 20 7 2 1 6   3  Rakesh Agrawal,Ramakrishnan Srikant.Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules[A  P roc eed i n gs of 2 0 t h I n t  C o n f C  Very  L a r g e  Data Bases\(VLDB\,Jorge B.Bocca,Matthias Jarke and Carlo Zaniolo,eds.Morgan Kaufmann Press,1994:487-499 4  Jiawei Han,Jian Pei,Yiwen Yin.Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Gerneration  P r o c e e d i n g s o f AC M S I GM O D  Intl.Conference on Management of Data[C W e i d on g C h e n  J e ffre y Naughton,Philip A.Bernstein eds.ACM Press,2000:1-12 5  A.Savasere,E.Omiecinski,S.Navathe.An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases[A P r o ce e d ing s o f  21th Int’1 Conf.Very Large Data Bases  S an F r a n ci s c o:M o r g a n  Kaufmann,1995.432-444 6  Joog Soo Park,Ming-Syan Chen,Philip S.Yu.An Effective Hash Based Algorithm for Mining Association Rules[A  P roc eed in gs of  ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data[C Mi ch a e l J  Ca rey a n d Donova n A  Sc hn ei d e r ed s  San Jose,Califormia,1995,175-186 7  Shi Zhizhong.Knowledge Discovery [M  B e ij in g:T s i n gh ua  University Press,2003 8  Chen An,Chen Ning,Data Mining Technology and Applicatio [M  Beijing:Science Press,2006 9  Zhu Yuquan ,Sun Zhihui,,I Xiaojun.

Overall Low Middle High OD  V CONCLUSION In this paper a generalized sequential association rule mining has been proposed using Generalized GNP with MBFP processing mechanism It is clari\336ed from simulations that the proposed method can extract important time-related association rules for each class of the consequent attributes ef\336ciently These rules are used to decide to which class the time-related data belong From simulations we have also found that the proposed method can be used in traf\336c prediction problems And the obtained rules can provide useful information for the Q-value based optimal route calculation thus 336nally improve the effectiveness of the optimal route algorithm for the navigation system Further improvements on how to combine the traf\336c volume prediction and optimal route algorithm more ef\336ciently will be studied in the next step R EFERENCES  I Kaysi M Ben-Aki v a and H K outsopoulos An Inte grated Approach to Vehicle Routing and Congestion Predictions for Real-time Driver 85 01 65 76 88 44 84 01 82 26 64 98 85 31 80 81 81 72 60 19 82 26 71 83 80 97 59 70 82 01 70 41 80 67 58 02 73 92 73 68 76 04 54 75 83 39 67 93 61 215 155 0.90 0.85 0.80 0.75 0.70 Fig 9 Comparison of the routes with or without prediction TABLE IV A VERAGE T RAVELING TIME OF OPTIMAL R OUTE  TIME UNIT  R out ef orO D pai r 2 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 2 wi t houtpredi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 3 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 3 wi t houtpredi ct i on O 1 O 2 O 3 D 1 D 2 D 3 Or,Dr O ri gin Dest i nat i on ofrout e r i i t i i t t 002 002 j j j j  Q d 6 0 5 i 002 b 212 b N f t t E Optimal Route with Traf\336c Prediction A Q i t V ij V ij V ij t Q Q Q   1 If 2 If 1 and 2 are the parameters for the reward and punishment by future traf\336c prediction respectively and 1  2   to intersection Middle Middle     Prediction Accuracy 0.95 1 51 19 187 13 114 26 Q d Q d N S W E  Low Low Low R out ef orO D pai r 1 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 1 wi t houtpredi ct i on 002 High High High j                                    W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7  respectively TABLE III A VERAGE P REDICTION A CCURACY FOR DIFFERENT SELF DECREASE RATE T ESTING      where  without prediction Improved Rate   2 3     1  1  Q d is 323Low\323 and the real traf\336c of this section at time is exactly 323Low\323 then the accuracy is 100 The values based on the current traf\336c Three OD pair accuracy means the accuracy when the real traf\336c is values by traf\336c prediction and using 002 002 current criteria the thresholds for evaluating the importance of the rules are decreased based on the self-decrease rate in order to extract enough number of rules for each class How to choose the proper self-decrease rate is very important since it in\337uences the testing accuracy as shown in Table III The accuracy is de\336ned in the following if the traf\336c prediction result of the section at time self-decrease rate It can be seen from Table III that the more the criteria for important association rules decreases the lower the prediction accuracies become The next step is to use the prediction for the optimal route calculation in order to obtain better routes For example if the navigation system knows section in the route will have a high traf\336c volume during the traveling the navigation system can chose another optimal route to avoid being trapped in the heavy traf\336c values at the intersections of the current route are revised as follows when the car arrive at the intersection at time 1 represents the traf\336c volume prediction from intersection at time 5 are used In order to study the ef\336ciency of the traf\336c volume prediction the greedy method is applied to the vehicle after the above update of values which means the vehicle will choose the route with the minimum Q-value Comparison is done between using updated s are considered for calculating the routes with or without prediction which are shown in Fig.9 As shown in the Table IV Q-value based optimal route calculation with traf\336c prediction can reduce the traveling time of the optimal route since it considers the future traf\336c situations when choosing the next section on the optimal route with prediction
