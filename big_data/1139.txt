Mining Sequential Association-Rule for Improving WEB Document Prediction Wang Yong  Li Zhanhuai  ZhangYang 168#,710072,Dept. of Computer & Software Northwestern Polytechnical University,China Wangyong@mail.nwpu.edu.cn lzh,zhangy }@co-think.com Abstract Currently, researchers have proposed several sequential association-rule models for predicting the next HTTP request. These researches focus on using sequence and temporal 
constrains for pruning to improve prediction precision. In this paper, we provide a comparative study on different kinds of sequential association rules for web document prediction. Firstly, we give algorithms on mining sequential association rules, which is based on different sequence and temporal constrains combination. Then, the performance of all such algorithms has been compared on a real web log dataset. Based on the comparison, by the method of variance 
analysis, we explore the effect of sequence and temporal information on influencing the precision of prediction. We show that the sequence constrains, the temporal constrains and the interaction between these two constrains can affect the precision of prediction. Furthermore temporal constrains can affect more than sequence constrains. These results show light on the future research on improving the precisions of prediction 
KEYWORDS  Sequential Association Rule, Web Usage Mining, Analysis of Variance 1. Introduction Mining customer access and usage patterns on the web log is an important task, which can be used to predict the HTTP request in the near future. Currently, many prediction models based on different sequential association-rule mining have been proposed. They all use sequence and 
temporal constrains to improving the performance of prediction. In this paper, we aim at further improving the performance, so we need to explore how does sequence and temporal information affect the precision of prediction. Firstly, we compare the precision of prediction for different sequence association rule algorithms; Secondly, we use variance analysis to study the influence of sequence and temporal information on improving precision. We show that the 
interaction between the sequence information and temporal information can affect the performance of prediction, and temporal constrains can affect more than sequence constrains Our method takes two steps. Firstly, we mine usage patterns; and secondly, we build predictive models based on these usage patterns. In the first step, we mine several kinds of sequence association rules. And specifically, we mine association patterns that are constrained 
sequentially and temporally. In the second step, we use a rule based predictive model   which always chooses a rule with the highest confidence among all the applicable association rules The rest of this paper is organized as following. Section 2 reviews the literature in related research; Section 3 presents the notion of sequence constrain and temporal constrain, and the

sequential association rule mining algorithm, which is based on the possible combination of these two constrains; Section 4 provides experimental results on one public available web log dataset and the Analysis of Variance of these results; Section 5 concludes this paper and present our ongoing work 2.  Related works To discover usage patterns, several approaches such as collaborative filtering via clustering Markov model of sequential navigation, and association mining have been proposed in the literatures [2     Collaborative filtering [8 uses consum er sp ec if ic his tor ica l da ta to c l as si fy user s in to  different category so that the users in each category have similar interests or buying patterns Then it uses these categories to predict usersê future interests by referencing their group. One limitation of this approach is that it can be quite inefficient, especially for web sites where the number of physical web pages is quite large. Furthermore, when user identities are hidden, this technique can lead to inaccurate predictions. While some approaches, which are based on the off-line clustering of page accesses and the use of dimensionality reduction[6 a v e been  suggested to overcome these limitations, these approaches are still quite expensive Techniques that rely on sequential patterns contain more precise information about users navigation behavior. Techniques that fall into this class include methods that rely on statistical models such as Markov models, sequential pattern mining and association rules mining  9 10 11  T h e s e a p p r oach es a l so suf fe r f r om the p r ob lem s that the siz e of rul e se t generated could be exceedingly large and therefore need to be pruned so as to make it effective  13 T e m poral and seq uent ial  in form ati on a r e m a in a ppro ach es [4 5] fo r pruni ng  rule s  which improve the scalability and precision of online recommendation system. However, the effect of these pruning approaches has not yet been explored comparatively. In i ang Y ang compared many sequential association rule algorithms. A crucial difference between the approach we discuss in the next section and Qiang Yangês work is that, they compared the algorithms which have been present before, whereas we explore the effect of sequence and temporal constrains on influencing the performance of prediction. Furthermore the methods are quite different 3. Mining prediction rules Here, we define sequential and temporal constraints. By applying combination of different sequence and temporal constraints, our algorithm can mine different sequential association rules sets, which have different ability for prediction Definition 1 Web Transaction: A web transaction is denoted by 12 m WT={WA WA  WA   i WA is a web-page access where each web access is draw from WP the set of all web pages \(in a given website Definition  2   Web Log: A web log is a set of web transactions, and it can be represented as 12 n WL={WT WT  WT   Definition 3  Rule: A rule is defined as 12 m-1 m RULE=\(WA WA  WA WA   Definition 4  Position: Let WA be a HTTP request, and 12 n WT={WA WA  WA  be a web transaction, if i WA WA  1 2  im   m+1 WA=WA  1  mn  then we say the position of WA in WT is m+1 Definition  5   Rule Distance: Let 12 n WT={WA WA  WA  be a web transaction and i1 i2 im-1 im RULE=\(WA WA  WA WA  be a rule, if WT contains all items in the rule and the positions of ik WA k=1,2 m in transaction WT are 12 m j j  j  Suppose after sorting 12 m j j  j   Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications \(ICCIMAê05 0-7695-2358-7/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


we get 12 m nn n j j  j  with 12 m nn n j<j j   then  ii-1 nn max j j  i=2 m is rule distance of RULE with respect to WT  For example, for a web transaction WT={A,B,C,D,E,F and a rule RULE=\(A,C D  WT contains each item in the rule. The positions of items A,C,D in WT are 1,3,4 separately. Sorting 1,3,4 we get 1,3,4 Then the absolute value of difference of consecutive items is {2 1}. The maximum of these absolute values is 2. So, the rule distance of this rule given the transaction WT is 2 Definition  6  Order Distance: Let 12 m-1 m RULE=\(WA WA  WA WA  be a rule, and i1 i2 in WT=\(WA WA   WA  be a transaction, with WT contains all items in the rule. Suppose sequence j1 j2 jm WA WA   WA  is found by sorting the sequence 12 m-1m WA WA  WA WA  according to the positions of i WA i=1,2 m in transaction WT. Then the minimum exchanges which is required by turning the sequence j1 j2 jm WA WA WA  into sequence 12 m-1m WA WA  WA WA  is the order distance of the rule RULE with respect to the transaction WT  For example, let WT={A,B,C,D,B,F be a web transaction, and RULE=\(A,D C be a rule WT contains all the items in RULE For items A,D,C  RULE the sequence A,C,D d be found according to the order of items in transaction WT Then the minimum exchanges required to turn the sequence A,C,D e sequence A,D,C rder distance of RULE with respect to transaction WT is 1 When mining association rules, once the frequent k-itemsets\(k>2\e been determined, for each itemset we can generate 1 2 k i ki i CC  association rules 2 k i k i p  sequential association rules involving a single consequent. When temporal and sequential constrains are used for pruning the number of rules could be reduced greatly Figure 1 shows the pseudo-code of the algorithm that can generates several kinds of sequential association rules set according different combination of sequence and temporal constrains. Firstly, we input the frequent itemstes mined by Apriori algorithm  distance threshold, order distance threshold, and support threshold; then, for each sequential association rule and each transaction in the training dataset we compute the rule distance and order distance; finally, we prune all sequential association rules by the sequence constrains and temporal constrains, and output the final set of sequence association rules Algorithm: PruninSequenceAssociation Input ItemSetTree  contains all frequent itemsets mined by the algorithm in [1 MinSupp  support threshold MaxRuleDis rule distance threshold MaxOrderDis order distance threshold Output ruleSet output sequence association rules set Begin Foreach  itemset i S contained in ItemSetTree // generate all sequence association rules Rules=sequenceRule i S involving a single consequent for i S Foreach transaction T  in Dataset Foreach rule L in Rules{    //if the set of items in transaction T contains the set of If\(ItemsContain\(T,L\\/ items in rule L If\(\(OrderDis\(T,L\<=MaxOrderDis \nd\(RuleDis\(T,L\=MaxRuleDis Increase Lês support by 1   Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications \(ICCIMAê05 0-7695-2358-7/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

Algorithm for mining sequence association rules When order distance and rule distance both are infinite, the algorithm we present is an association rule mining algorithm. When order distance is 0 and rule distance is infinite, the algorithm is the subsequence mining algorithm When o r de r dis tan ce i s 0 a nd rul e di stan ce  is 1, the algorithm is latest-substring mining algorithm Whichever parameter is used, once the rules have been generated by our algorithm, they can be used for predict the next HTTP request for a transaction. Firstly, we try to match the left hand of each rule with the transaction. When matching a transaction, order distance and rule distance criteria must be satisfied. Then, the rule with highest confidence among the list of matched rules is used to predict next HTTP request. For instance, if the transaction has involved accessing A,C,D,E in that order, and the rule distance is 1, then the rule A,E X does not match the given transaction. The reason is that rule distance of A and E is 3 4. Experimental results and analysis We employ a real data set clarknet_access_log_Aug28.gz for our experiment [1 T h e  log was collected from Aug. 28, 1995 to Sep. 3, 1995.

We use the method described in  for prepr ocessi n g  After data prep roces sin g we ha ve 9 888 8 tran sactio ns and 88 13 7 different IP addresses. Then, the set of transactions has been divided into two datasets and each one is divided again into a training set and a testing set. The number of transactions in training set and testing set is 37063 and 12361, respectively We carried out the experiment on a PC with 4 2.4 P G 256M windowsXP/jdk1.4.2/.

01 H  02 H and 03 H That is to say, sequence and temporal constrains, the interaction between these two variable can affect the precision of prediction Finally, we use Matlab and data in table 1 for fitting curves. Among linear model, interaction model, pure quadratic model and full quadratic model, full quadratic model produces the best fitting curves for experimental data.

From the formula, we can see that the precision will increase, when 1 x reduce and 2 x is a constant and vice versa. Clearly when 12  xx are small 1 x has more impact than 2 x on influencing y  5. Conclusion In this paper, we explore the effect of sequence and temporal information on influencing the performance. We show that the sequence constrains, the temporal constrains and the interaction between them can affect the performance of prediction, and the temporal information based methods can affect more than the sequence information based methods. So, if we want to improve the performance of web document prediction, these relations should be embodied in the algorithm. For example, we can improve the performance by some certain algorithms which is presented by given different weight to sequence constrains and the temporal constrains, so as to capture the relationship.

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
