recommended item values. This system can avoid interested items in the MUês opposite direction and give higher weights value to the points of interest \(POIs\ the predicted moving region in order to provide correct and real-time information and promote user satisfaction. We will use simulations to further verify the recommended accuracy and efficiency of the proposed RCCF recommendation system, but also look forward to apply on related mobile services  Keywords-recommendation system; location dependent; LBS collaborative filtering I   I NTRODUCTION  In a location based mobile computing environment 
mobile users \(MUs\an acquire location dependant information from anywhere and anytime by utilizing mobile Devices \(MDs\such as mobile phones and notebooks. The remote database servers will reply by MD coordinates where the content of the information required. The information is only valid in a particular area, and the results with the MUês location of the current situation are related closely [1  Although the LBS services provided a convenient life for users, there are many problems of LBS such as data delayed transmission and MUs sent queries repeatedly. It caused the remote servers overloaded and network bandwidth wasted For MUs access the information more efficient, in past 
research, the authors proposed the mobile agent method and the pre-fetching mechanisms [2 3   Th ei r l ack s o f  consideration of the continuity check user behaviors resulted in remote servers reply to MUsê location dependent data queries frequently. This paper proposes behavioral linked events analytical method to explore the implicit correlation values from the events and compounds with items-based recommendation system. The system used MU location of query to estimate MU's follow-up patterns of behaviors and incorporated the mass appraisal criteria query category to predict the output closer to the MUs and the personal preferences of recommended items more accurately 
II  R ELATED W ORKS  A  Association Rule The Association Rule \(AR\ is an analyzing and prediction method utilized for data mining [4 fer e nce [5 stated that the purpose of the AR is used to identify the association among data items from a large number of transaction records. The most important application for AR is the Market Basket Analysis. In the Market Basket Analysis, customer shopping information is analyzed to identify the hidden relationship between data items Support and Confidence are two primary variables in the AR to evaluate the strength and validity for the association 
Support refers to the frequency that both X and Y items appear simultaneously in transactional databases to be analyzed. The equation for Support is depicted in equation 1\. Confidence refers to probability that one item X will reveal itself when another item Y appears. The Confidence equation is illustrated in equation \(2  1  2  Support is the rule strength of the AR. Reference [6  indicated that the higher the value for Support, the more reliable the AR is. An AR is only valid when both Support 
and Confidence in the analysis exceed Minimum Support and Minimum Confidence, threshold values that are preset by users In [7   th e au th o r s p r o p o se d  th e Qu ick  Sim p le  Decomposition \(QSD\gorithm.

and filter for information that matches MUsê requirements The MUs can use rating mechanisms to evaluate recommended information with ratings and feedback to the rating DBs The CF recommendation system was divided into Userbased, Item-based and Social Filtering CF recommendation systems  T h e Us erbas e d an d S o c i al Filt er in g C F  algorithms calculates the similarity of the preferences of individuals or groups, and then the systems recommend topN items of interest to users. The users are feedback their rating to the system records by the appraisal mechanism. The feedback rating should use for the next time similarity evaluation of user preferences and other reference value. In the User-based algorithms, the more users, the more rating items. It will also increase the algorithm's complexity The item-based CF algorithm explored the relationships between items first, and the relationships between items are relatively static. It used the user preference records of items and the association rules among items to estimate many unknown user rating accuracy and recommend the higher rating of the items to the user. The system can used to solve the derived problem from sparseness of items [9  I n   10 Slope One algorithm is an item-based CF algorithm. It can be quickly to estimate the reasonable accuracy of the data items rated, and it also can be effective recommendations for the new visitors or less usersê rating. This paper used the Slope One algorithm to predict the behavior associated rules with the corresponding data items within the project area The recommendation system will produce the topN list of the recommended rating values  Figure 1  Example of Item-based CF Fig. 1 shows the usersê ratings for user-item matrix. It is used to compare the similarity among the items. In itembased CF recommendation system, the similarity algorithm is a very important role. The similarity algorithm uses the distance formula to calculate the correlation of all items, and then it will predict the POIsê ratings that users had not evaluated it yet. The item-based similarity algorithm is illustrated with \(3     3   Where Sim  i  j   The similarity between items i and j  U The set of users who both rated i and j  r u,i The rating of user u on item i  r u,j The rating of user u on item j The average of u th userês rating III  RCCF  R ECOMMENDATION S YSTEM MODEL  This section explains the system model and the major algorithms of the relational compound collaborative filtering RCCF\ Recommendation System A  System Architecture     Figure 2  System Architecture of RCCF Recommendation System Fig. 2 shows the system architecture of RCCF recommendation system. In this system, the MUês sent his query condition and GPS position to the RCCF recommendation system via the GPS modules inside his mobile device. The relation module of the system will base on the MUsê behavior records to find out the association rules of the interest items in order to further predict the next interest items of MUsê moving behaviors The RCCF recommendation system will also take into account the MUês next possible region of the moving path and accordingly select the topN items from the activities association rules to CF module. The CF module based on the MUsê historical rating records to evaluate the weights of the interested items in those regions, so as to calculate the topN  items with higher weight for recommendation. The MU could actively feedback his preferences on the recommended items. If the MU does not make any subjective evaluation the system will actively make its own judgment based on the  22         ui u u j u uU ui u u j u uU uU rrr r Sim i j rr r r 003 003\003    003 003\003 u r

usage behavior patterns from the MU to evaluate his preferences, thus to construct a more complete rating DBs to solve the problem of sparse data in the CF mechanism In order to mine the relational rules form the MUs continuous query behaviors to explore a sense of the rules We design the schema of the database table associated with the storage structure, as shown in Table 1. If the MU keeps more complete information about the behaviors, the mining information of the relational rules will become more accurate TABLE I  THE  SCHEMA OF ASSOCIATED  RULES  RECORDS  B  Behaviors Mining Method Data mining is often used to analyze usersê requirements or moving behaviors model. Most users use data mining to mine their past records to predict the next information of the usersê location or future inquiries. It will improve the system efficiency and cache hit rate. However, in real lifeês environment, it will be dependent correlation patterns between mobility and demand patterns. If the user wants to get the implicit association rules, he must mine the moving behaviors model and the user's requirements at the same time   In order to address the study of the relationship among user behaviors, this paper assume that the query of each MU is valid for a range of cell. When the MU issues a query, the system returns its mining results from the near cell recommended rating value as a reference grid. The behavior associated module used QSD algorithm module t o m i n e  all MUsê records of information related behavioral characteristics, and to filter out the valued cell near to the user location The POIs are distributed in the experimental environment randomly in order to show the impact of behavior mining results, as shown in Fig. 3  If the user u moves from point P 0  to point P 1 direction, MU at P 0 point for real-time location via GPS module, and issued a "restaurant" of the query information content  The system is according the users location to analysis the strength of associated rules in adjacent grid cells where X represents the usersê areas. The cell grids of interconnectedness are 1 X Relate_Reg IR 004 80 2 X Relate_Reg IR 004 60 3 XRelate_Reg IR 004 40 The paper checks the prediction by the user query corresponds to the POIs area information, find Relate_Reg 1 and Relate_Reg 2 area information are qualified, and the traditional location-based recommendation systems approach to retrieve the corresponding region 020 1 020 2 and 020 3 restaurant information. Its recommended list determined by sorting the user preference rating matrix. However, taking into consideration the characteristics of mobile users, if only just recommended POI information to the user from the satisfaction rating matrix, may cause the system does not recommend the items on the user's moving direction, which means users need to issue continuous query to obtain the required information       40 IR  60 IR  80 IR    Figure 3  The user moving model in associated cells diagram C  Recommended Information Module To recommend real-time and effective LBS information this paper used the Slope One algorithm [1  a s t h e  b a s i s for  the recommendation module. If the MU sent a query, the behavior associated module would output the location information and sort the items rating, and based on the user's rating of the POIs, resulting in topN of the recommended value of the list. If the user did not set the region corresponding rating to all the POIs or the user had not went the region yet, the system will also compare the first data item with all users of the rating differences to find out the preferences items of the same group. And then the system set the ratings of POI and recommended to the users The user preference rating information is initialized by learning and default values. It often resulted in recommended follow-up results of real and personal preferences have a considerable gap. The system needs to be training samples over a period of time in order to make the recommended results close to stable [13  T h e p a pe r g e n e r a tes  10  of th e dominant rating randomly and saves them to records. Each user used the records to predict the POIês rating effectively The POIs' ratings are refer to Likert scale [14  th e ra tin g  5 points means that users are very interested in this item, 4 is divided into interest, 3 is divided into ordinary, 2 is divided

into not interested, 1 is totally not interested and 0 point is presented the user has not rating for that. This paper used Slope One Scheme to predict the rating from exists rating of users. Given a data set X its any two items j and i by users u  rating are annotated u j and u i individually Annotation   ji uS X 003 the number of set S j  i  X  annotated Card  S j  i  X We consider the average deviation of item i with respect to item j as \(4       ji ji ji uS X ji uu dev Card S X 003   003   4 002 Given that dev j  i  u i is a prediction for u j given u i  Like u  j is the average of all such predictors. The Like u  j is illustrated with \(5      j j ii iR uj j dev u Like Card R 003   003 5 Where     0 jji RiiSuijCardSX 003 005  is the set of all relevant items Finally, this paper integrates behaviors associated module and recommendation information module to calculate the area associated values and the corresponding region of the recommended POI rating, resulting in topN of the recommended value of the list. The RCCF is illustrated with 6   1  uj i j u,j R CCF IR  Like 006\006 004    6 Where u is a mobile user at the position of POI information i  i is corresponding to the POI information j is corresponding to the predicted POI information, then 002 is the modulation parameter can be any value between the 01 006 007\007  range, that means the system can, as the case adjust the weight value between j i IR 004 and u,i L ike If 002 is closer to 0, it means that does not consider the impact of the user associated behavior, only preferred the POI rating to have a list of recommended values. It is not differences from the past location-based scheme. If 002 is closer to 1, it represented the user concern associated rules with the adjacent area. It can be applied to query results from the properties of the POIs. In this paper, the default value of the parameter 002 is set to 0.5, on behalf impact of behavior associated with the recommended modules D  Algorithms Algorithm 1 RCCF Top-N Recommended Items Algorithm INPUT LDQueryString MUBehaviorRecords  itemsRatingValue OUTPUT Top-N  Recommended Items 1: itemTopNList ITNL 002 NULL 2: Parse LDQueryString 3: Get MUês GPS Info 4: Select LDQuery Attribute of POI from MUBehaviorRecords  5: Calculate the RelatedRegion  RR of the MU 6 predictedItemsList PIL 002 Call the QSD algorithm 7 itemsRatingValueList IRVL 002 Call the RCCF sub-algorithm  8 For all data items in IRVL  do  9:     Get the value of each item rating 10:     RecommendValueList RVL 002 RCCF 11 end for  12 ITNL 002 Sort RVL  13: Return ITNL   IV  P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION  The simulation will be designed using JAVA. We will also simulate situations of DBsê overload and excessive MUsê queries to get indexes on the average response time from DBs. In order to evaluate the precision of the prediction, we will use Precision, Mean Absolute Error MAE\ and Response Time as the evaluation factors A  Mean Absolute Error , MAE MAE is a measurement of mean absolute error of system predicted rating against MUês feedback rating. The MAE is illustrated with \(7 1 N ii i P r MAE N    003 7 where P i predicted ratings of item i  r i actual ratings of item i  N: number of items Smaller MAE value means higher prediction precision to the actual rating B  Coverage  C cat  The Recommended coverage ratio is a measurement of the number of items has been recommended with the total number items in the database.

CONCLUSION In the present study, distributed learning automata method was examined for sequence pattern mining in a set of sequence data. This method could assist in a great extent to suppliers of goods or shop owners in finding sequence of the customers shopping. We demonstrated that by this method we are able to extract in two-member, three-member n-member that have had the most iteration and provide them to the shop owners for decision making and accurate arrangements of goods in the shelves. It was compared with other methods and its results show higher efficiency of the proposed method than the other ones. Finding of the categories leads to increase of satisfaction of the customers in shopping, increase of the stores profits and decrease of the customers  confusion in finding their necessary products

Judging by common sense, the High threshold is defined as follows: for sections with one lane , if there exist 2 or more cars in 10 meters, then it is a High volume situation. On the other hand, the middle threshold is defined as follows: for sections with one lane, if there exist more than 1, and less than 2 cars in 10 meters, it is a Middle volume situation. The remains will be discretized to Low traffic volume situation The cars are randomly generated based on the values of the pre-defined OD\(OringinJDestination for every OD pair is changing during the execution as shown in Fig.6 lY l Jl .? 15 co ? 10 Xl 5 Q O .r:: 0 o 50 100  150 T:in e 4n ilutes Fig. 6.

Total number of rules extracted In order to check the effectiveness of the extracted rules we tested the classification accuracy of the proposed method using the classifier with competition The average prediction accuracy is shown in Table V. The accuracy is defined in the following: if the traffic prediction result of the section at time t is "Low" and the real traffic of this section at time t is exactly "Low", then the accuracy is 100%. The low/middle/high accuracy means the accuracy when the real traffic is low/middle/high, respectively Table V shows that the method with Accuracy Validation can improve the overall accuracy than the method without Accuracy Validation. The Middle volume of the traffic network can not be predicted accurately because the middle situations do not appear frequently enough to generate an enough number of association rules TABLE V AVERAGE PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR TESTING DATABASE Method Prediction Accuracy Overall Low Middle High With Accuracy Validation 84.82 85.84 57.71 89.71 Without Accuracy Validation 82.64 83.57 56.57 87.13 Longer step prediction is explored by studying the 2-step, 3step and 4-step prediction, where n-step means the prediction of the traffic volume at n time points later. It's results are shown in Fig. 8. It is shown from Fig.8 that the prediction accuracy decreases as the number of prediction step increases but the increase of the number of steps does not affect the overall accuracy so much, so the proposed method can do relative stable prediction even if the number of prediction steps Increases The ratio of the usable rules to the total number of rules in each prediction step is shown in Fig.9, which describes that 


how the number of the usable rules for prediction decreases by the increase of the prediction steps, considering the condition that the time delay between the antecedent part and consequent part should be bigger or equal to the prediction step. In another word, as the prediction step increases, the number of the usable rules decreases 86 if G 84 82 80 f-------?-""":__---------1 0:: 78 r-------------">.-======---1 :? 76 -------------------j 74 72 4 n-6tep I?w ihAcCUlacyValiiarnn -w ihoutAcCUlacyValiiarnn I Fig. 8.

CONCLUSION In this paper, an association rule mining method using GNP with Accuracy Validation mechanism has been proposed. It is clarified from simulations that the proposed method can extract important time-related association rules for each class of the consequent attributes efficiently. What's more important is that these rules can be used to decide to which class the time related data belong accurately. From simulations, we have also 


found that the proposed method can be used in traffic volume prediction problems.

encountering a related term, i.e. IC\(c e intuition behind the use of the negative likelihood is that the more probable a term to appear, the less information it conveys. All these features show that Jiangs measure tends to be more general and more appropriate for evaluating nontaxonomically related terms. Indeed, a high score of the relatedness measures suggests a strong relationship between terms Nevertheless, all relatedness measures have limitations because they assume that all the semantic content of a particular term is modeled by semantic links in WordNet Consequently, in many situations, truly related terms obtain a low scores even though their belongings to a certain category of tags, e.g., jargon tags Additionally, when measuring the quality of an automatically knowledge acquisition results, the typical measures used in Information Retrieval are Recall, Precision and F-Measure. However, computing Recall and F-Measure requires the availability of a Gold Standard. Hence, we will only compute the Precision which speci?es to which extent the non-taxonomic relationships is extracted correctly. In this case, the ratio between the correctly extracted relations i.e., their relatedness measures is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, and the whole number of extracted ones is computed. Thus, we have Precision Total correctly selected entities Total selected entities 12 http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity 13 A term refers to a tag subject or a tag object C. Evaluation of non-taxonomic relationships Only a percentage of the full set of non-taxonomic relationships \(89 is caused by the presence of non standard terms which are not contained in WordNet and, in consequence, cannot be evaluated using WordNet-based relatedness measures. Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation results of the extracted non-taxonomic relationships against their relatedness measures High relatedness score \(88 17% of the extracted relationships, as most of terms are strongly related with respect WordNet Null Scores were obtained for 5% of the extracted 


relationships. Analyzing this case in more detail, we have observed that the poor score is caused in many situations by the way in which Jiangs distance metric works. This latter completely depends on the distance between two terms based on the number of edges found on the path between them in WordNet. In consequence this measure returns a value that does not fully represent reality. For example, on the one hand, Jiangs distance metric returns a null value for the relationship between insurance and car, even though the ?rst is a commonly related to the second, i.e., car involved insurance Finally with a minimal Jiangs distance metric threshold, set to 46%, the computed precision of correctly extracted relationships candidates is equal to 68.8 An example of extracted non-taxonomic relationships is depicted in Table V where each relation describes the subject tag, e.g., tool, the predicate, e.g is being developed within, and the object tag, e.g mesh. Fig. 4 represent a fragment output of the extracted ontological structure where each concept de?nes a set of similar and synonym tags and labels, i.e., mentions has been, revealed, caused and is created with describe the predicates of the non-taxonomic relationships between terms Due to the limitations observed by the automatic evaluation procedure and the lack of gold standards containing non-taxonomic relationships, we have examined the extracted non-taxonomic relationships from a linguistic point 377 Top space      distance     quad great     groovy nifty caused address      addresses extension      quotation   reference  references extensions        referenz     source      refrence sources    rfrences    quotations research    search     searching searchs open-source     open_source

This qualitative evaluation can bring some interesting insights about the kind of results one can expect Invalid relations are extracted: Even though a relation such as music cities skill is considered as correct one since tag subject, tag object and predicate are correctly extracted. From a semantic point of view, this relation has no meaning. Hence, a higher precision is expected Figure 5.

Thus we expect that the redundancy removal within extracted relations will be of bene?t for the improvement of the 


obtained results VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The extraction of non-taxonomic relationships from folksonomies is to the best of our knowledge is the least tackled task within ontology building from folksonomy. This is why there is a need of novel and general purpose approaches covering the full process of learning relationships. In this paper, we introduced a new approach called NONTAXFOLKS that starts by pre-processing tags aiming at getting a set of frequent tagsets corresponding to an agreed representation Then, they are used to retrieve related tags using external resources such as WordNet. Thanks to the particular structure of triadic concepts, it allows grouping semantically related tags by considering the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the folksonomy. Thereafter we introduced an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pair of tags picked from the triadic concepts. In summary, our approach uses several well known techniques \(such as formal concept analysis or association rule discovering the social bookmaring environnement in order to propose a new way of extracting labeled non-taxonomic relationships between tags. Currently, we are investigating the following topic concerning the discovered predicates between two terms. Indeed, in order to avoid relationships redundancy and thus a redundancy in the builded ontology. One can try to classify them into prede?ned semantic classes, detect synonyms, inverses, etc. A standard classi?cation of verbs could be used for this purpose, adding additional information about the semantic content, e.g., senses, verb types, thematic roles, etc., of predicates relationships 378 REFERENCES 1] J.
