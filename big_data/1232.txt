Huge volume of information\ncollected from a large set of sensors poses great challenges\nto make inferences for prediction of signi?cant events. We\ncollaborate with a US Class I railway company and apply\nadvanced analytics techniques to be able to predict alarms\nassociated with catastrophic equipment failures several days\nahead of time. We use the case study in railroad to demonstrate\nthe techniques to address the big data concerns. In addition,\nthe alarm-prediction rule development needs to satisfy the\ncritical constraints to meet the high standards of prediction\naccuracy combined with human interpretability in railroad\nindustry. We build customized SVM algorithm to meet the\nrequirements. By adding a unique and remarkable feature of\nhuman interpretability to the rules we develop, our solution is\nable to facilitate the decision making process of operators and\nlead to ef?cient operational decision support.\nI MOTIVATION\nDue to its low cost, ef?ciency and ?exibility, sensor net-\nwork is broadly used across industries to monitor equipment\nconditions. [1] presents the development of wireless sensors\nfor use in various applications. Particularly, in railroad in-\ndustry, conducting preventative maintenance on the rail cars\nis essential to maintaining the ef?ciency and safety of the\nrail network. Over the last few years, railroad has invested\nin lots of new sensors to measure various characteristics like\ntemperature, noise signature, contact load between wheel\nand rail, etc. of each wheel assembly on all rail cars at many\npoints throughout the network.\nThe ubiquity of connectivity and the growth of sensors\nhave opened up a large storehouse of information. The\nbearing temperature detectors, for the Class I railroad un-\nder study, generate 3 terabytes of data in a year. Other\nindustries offer possibilities of even larger amount of data\ngenerated under normal operating conditions, e.g., a Boeing\njet generates 10 terabytes of information per engine every 30\nminutes of ight-time [2]. The amount of data is only going\nto continue to rise. There has been a lot of recent progress\nin big data warehousing to manage, store and retrieve this\ninformation including Netezza and Teradata, but the true\nvalue is realized only if you are successful in mining and\nusing the signals contained in the information effectively.\nThe sensor network contains the following series of func-\ntions including monitoring and collecting the data, assessing\nand evaluating the information using existing alarm rules,\nissuing alerts, formulating meaningful user displays, and per-\nforming decision-making. In these procedures, developing\nalarm rules plays a critical role in decision making. When\nthe component failure is imminent, the alarm of catastrophic\nfailure is usually issued, leaving little time for planning and\nputting the maintenance organization in reactive mode. In\nthe case study of railroad, we propose to develop rules\nand predict the alarms related to catastrophic component\nfailure in advance such that it provides enough time for the\nmaintenance organization to proactively plan the repair or\nreplacement action.\nRule development needs to satisfy the critical constraints\nto meet the high standards in safety-conscious industries.\nThe ?rst one is detection accuracy. The algorithms must\nbe extremely accurate to capture anomalies so that it can\nprevent future hazardous failures. Secondly, capturing more\nfailures usually bring in more false alarms that leads to a\nhigher false alarm rate. Under the constrained crew resources\nand budgets, companies can only afford very low false alarm\nrate. The third constraint is that the rules developed to\ntrigger alarms should allow for the rationale for its actions\nunder various situations to be understood and interpreted by\nhumans. Human understanding and interpretation of the rule\nsets can easily lead to ef?cient operational decision support.\nIn this research within the context of railroad industry,\nwe focus on using machine-learning approach to predict\nalarms associated with catastrophic equipment failures while\nmaking rules human interpretable. We explore several well\nknown supervised machine learning techniques including\nDecision Tree [3], K-Nearest Neighborhood \(KNN  ANN  SVM  decision tree has the capability\nof human interpretability, it only tends to perform better\nwhen dealing with discrete/categorical features. On the other\nhand, the rules developed based on KNN, ANN and SVM\nlack the ability to be readily understood and interpreted by\nhumans. Many researchers have tried to address the issue\nof improving the comprehensibility of the outputs from\nthe “black box” algorithms. [7] extracted symbolic rules\nfrom trained neural networks. They divided the activation\nvalues of relevant hidden units into two subintervals and\nthen found the set of relevant connections of those relevant\nunits to construct rules. It is also worth mentioning that [8]\nidenti?ed the con?ict between the idea of rule extraction and\ntraditional connectionism.\nWe want to emphasize the contrast of this approach\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 7\nagainst how these machine learning techniques are

In settings such as ranking of search results or\nrecommender system; the relative improvements of true\npositives are important but the cost associated with false\npositives and absolute values of true positives are relatively\nlow \(no safety concerns and operational costs understood by humans \(a\nblack-box approach is ?ne contribution is to tweak these well-\nknown machine learning techniques to meet the unique\nconstraints of high operating cost, safety-consciousness and\nheavy regulations inherent in industrial settings as described\nabove.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the\nbackground of the project we collaborated with a US Class\nI railroad and the data we use to provide alarm prediction.\nIt is followed by Section III which provides details of the\nmachine learning approach to handle big data issue in the\nclassi?cation context. In Section IV, we focus on how to\ngenerate human-interpretable rules from customized SVM\nmodel results. Then in the end, we present the result and\nsummary in Section V.\nII. BACKGROUND AND DATA\nA. Background\nWe collaborate with a US Class I railroad and apply\nadvanced analytics and optimization technologies to multiple\nbusiness processes. This collaboration initiative is targeted\nat the development of data models, automated learning\ntechniques and spatio-temporal rules engine, in support of\nautomatically detecting critical issues on rail cars and com-\nponents by combining information from multiple way-side\ndetectors currently deployed across their rail network. The\ngoal is to lower service interruptions and improve network\nvelocity.\nThe railway company manages an extensive network with\nmore than 1, 000 wayside detectors that monitor conditions\nof each passing freight car. A variety of detectors are\ninstalled along the rail tracks including a dozen of wheel\nimpact load detectors \(WILD ABD more than 800 hotbox detectors \(HBD measure bearing temperatures. The WILD system is\ncomposed of a series of strain gages welded to the rail The\nstrain gages measure wheel impact load by quantifying the\nforce applied to the rail. ABD captures noise emitted from\nthe bearings and is designed to alert to speci?c acoustic\nsignature that identify bearing defects prior to overheating.\nDue to detector accuracy and industry-wide adoption, one\nof the major focus areas for railroad is in monitoring bearing\ntemperature to prevent bearings meltdowns. The railroad\nhas developed some rules using HBD, WILD and ABD\nobservations that can predict imminent wheel and bearing\nfailures. SMEs express high con?dence in the ability of\nthese three detectors to identify bearing issues. While HBD\ngives the direct measurements of bearing temperature, the\nreason to add wheel impact force measurements in the rules\nis that out-of-bound wheels may transfer improper impact\nforces to bearings leading to hot bearings and eventual wheel\nand bearing failure. ABD monitors bearing noise, indicating\ndefects that may eventually lead to bearing overheating\nproblems. The existing rules are developed based on the\nexperts’ experience and knowledge in concert with industry\nstandards. They are easy to understand and implement.\nFor example, when the bearing temperature \(monitored by\nHBD train is required. However,\ndue to their simplicity, they can only capture imminent\noverheating and bearing failure accurately. This does not\nprovide enough lead time to perform proactive maintenance\nplanning and resource optimization. On the other hand,\ndetector vendors also build sophisticated alarm rules for each\ntype of detectors. Unfortunately, these rules are implemented\nin a black-box fashion without any visibility in reasoning for\na particular alarm triggering. Thus they are not widely used\nin the real operations.\nThe railroad has three levels of warm bearing alarms\nbased on different thresholds. The Level 1 alarm is the high-\nest level. When Level 1 alarm is issued, the train needs to be\nstopped and inspected, and repaired, if needed, immediately.\nThe unanticipated interruption will have signi?cant impact\non network velocity. On average, 1, 000 Level 1 alarms is\nissued every year. The set-out cost is estimated around 5\nmillions dollars to cover the immediate inspection on these\nalarms. Therefore, it is extremely valuable for the railroad\nto be able to predict Level 1 alarms several days in advance.\nIt will give the railroad extra time to deploy resources for\ninspection and accordingly prevent costly train stops and\nnetwork interruption.\nThe railroad operators are safety conscious and reluctant\nto remove any of the existing rules. Thus, we do not aim\nto make any change of their current alarm rules. Instead,\nwe are providing human interpretable rules to predict the\nhighest level alarms, i.e., Level 1 alarms. Furthermore, since\nthe company has limited resources to afford too many\nadditional alarms generated by our predictive rules, our\nalarm prediction algorithm must be very accurate to keep\nfalse alarm rate very low. In addition, to facilitate decision\nmaking process, our rule development system also provides\nthe capability to generate the con?dence level associated\nwith each prediction. By ranking the con?dence level of each\nprediction, operators can prioritize the prediction results\nbased on their resource availability.\nB. Data\nWhen a rail car passes an equipped detector, the detector\nwill report different features of the equipment. HBD is used\nto monitor the temperature of bearings 


Since there are more\n8\nthan 800 HBDs in the network and around 150, 000 cars\nrunning each day on average, the data size of HBD readings\nis large, about 3TB for a year which covers more than\n500, 000 cars. WILD system reports the features to describe\ndynamic impact load at each wheel level, such as maximum\npeak force \(KIPS maximum lateral force \(KIPS wheel level and car level data come from different\ntables. We merge the information through equipment id and\nthe message id which is generated by each detector for each\ntrain trip. ABD tables are composed of alarm event data such\nas the acoustic alarms for different bearing defect signatures.\nIn the alarm prediction, we give two sets of parameters\nthat the operators can control. One is the prediction time\nwindow. That is how many days in advance the alarm\nprediction is generated. The algorithm is designed to offer\npredictions either 3 or 7 days in advance, which gives\nenough reacting time for the railroad to prepare for inspec-\ntions considering resource availability. The second is the\nhistorical reading time window. This window includes all\nhistorical readings that are used to forecast alarms. Based on\nthe live storage capabilities of railroad detector IT systems,\nthe algorithm is designed to work with two options, 7 days\nand 14 days. By combining the two sets of parameters, the\nalgorithm is tuned for four settings of prediction, i.e., 7-7, 7-\n3, 14-7, and 14-3. The ?rst number indicates the reading time\nwindow and the second one the prediction time window For\nexample, 7-3 setting means using the past 7 days of HBD\nreadings from current day, we can provide alarm prediction\nfor day 3 in the future.\nIn data preparation, we merge the alarm data and detector\nreadings by bearing id and speci?ed time window. Given a\nLevel 1 hot bearing alarm, we identify the bearing id and\ndate associated with the alarm. Then search the readings\nfrom HBD, WILD and ABD of the same bearing and\ncorresponding historical time window. This procedure poses\nsome challenges. There are much fewer number of WILD\nand ABD, compared to HBD, in the entire railway network,\nand accordingly, much fewer observations from WILD and\nABD than those from HBD. On average, there are 20 to 30\nobservations per wheel in a year from WILD Since ABD\nonly keeps alarm events, the records are even sparse. That\nmeans if we choose the same length of historical reading\nwindow for those three detectors, such as 14 days, there may\nbe no any records from WILD or ABD for the same bearing.\nTo obtain more information, we extend the reading time\nwindow to 1 month for WILD and 3 months for ABD while\n7 or 14 days for HBD. Now we illustrate the procedures of\ngenerating model inputs using an example of a hot bearing\nalarm of bearing AAAA1 recorded on May 25, 2012. To\nmerge the alarm record with corresponding readings, we\nsearch all detector readings of bearing AAAA1. Under the\nsetting of 7-3 for example, the prediction time window is\n3 days. That is to look back at the past readings from\nMay 22. For HBD we pick the readings from May 16 to\nMay 22, 2012 which is 7 day reading window; for WILD,\nuse readings from Apr 22 to May 22, 2012 and for ABD,\nuse Feb 22 to May 22, 2012. Once the model inputs are\ngenerated, we can develop the classi?cation algorithm for\nalarm prediction.\nIII. MODEL DEVELOPMENT\nThe predicting system consists of four main components,\nfeature extraction, dimension reduction, model training and\nprediction and con?dence estimation. We begin to describe\neach component in the subsections.\nA. Feature Extraction\nIn this step, we discuss what features should be included\nin the learning process and how to extract them from the\nraw detector readings. Based on the test results from over\nthousands of random trials, ABD data, due to its sparsity and\nmeasurement error associated with the detector itself, did not\nexhibit signi?cant impact on predicting railcar failures and\nsometimes even make the performance worse. Therefore, we\nexclude ABD data from our prediction. We in this project\nfocus on using WILD and HBD measurements as they show\nsigni?cant correlation with the occurrence of Level I alarms.\nWithin a selected reading time window, a set of statistical\nfeatures are extracted from HBD and WILD readings, in-\ncluding maximum values, 95%, 90%, 80 quantiles, mean,\nstandard deviation, etc. In addition, to capture the trending\nof detector readings over time with the interests to detect\nthe increasing trend of temperature, we calculate the slope\nof the readings over time. Moreover, standard deviation of\nthe measurements from a single bearing is calculated to\nrepresent the variability.\nIn total, 55 features are selected and extracted from\nHBD and WILD measurements, which will be used for the\nlearning and prediction. It is worth to note that a feature from\nWILD data, the number of records of maximum peak force\nlarger than 90 KIPS, is the most discriminative one amongst\nall the 55 features. The other 54 features provide comparable\nperformance in the learning. Therefore, we include all the 55\nfeatures for model learning as none of them can be discarded\nwithout hurting the performance and reliability.\nIn the step of feature extraction, big data issue poses huge\nchallenge. For the railway company we work with there\nare around 150,000 railcars running every day on average\nand each railcar is equipped with at least 8 bearings. HBDs\ngenerate around 1.5 TB amount of data in half a year.\nSince the measurements of bearings and railcars from each\ndetector are stored in separate ?les, we need to link bearing\ninformation with its corresponding railcar. Considering 3TB\ndata amount in one year, it becomes an arduous task to\nmerge bearing 


tables and its corresponding railcar tables.\nAdditionally, we also need to match the bearing information\nfrom HBD to those from WILD, the time complexity of\n9\nfeature extraction turns to be the major concern in model\ndevelopment. We shall now present two simple methods,\nhashing and parallelization, that can be used to accelerate\nthe feature extraction process.\nHashing In the raw ?les of sensor readings, each railcar\nis labeled by an 8-character string, which is the internal\nserial number of that railcar. Through testing, we ?nd that\nin practice the string matching consumes most runtime\nwhen merging the tables. The original 7-month HBD data\nis comprised of 3.8547 × 109 lines in text ?les and each\nline corresponds to a temperature record of a single railcar\nbearing. To directly locate a bearing using string matching\nin such a huge ?le, assume a computer is able to handle\n100, 000 string matchings in a second, it would take around\n38, 547 seconds to locate all the records of a particular\nbearing, which is roughly 26.8 day. Hence, we propose a\ndouble-layer hashing scheme to make such data aggregation\naffordable. Each hash table can be viewed as a content\ntable/list and a double-layer hashing implies that we build a\ntwo-layer content table/list for all unique warm bearings For\ninstance, to locate a HBD record, we ?rst look up the ?rst\nlayer content table \(higher level hash table and it indicates\nwhich second layer content table that we should go to. We\nthen look up the returned second layer content table for\nthe readings of a particular railcar/bearing. In this way, we\nare able to ef?ciently match sensor readings to their cor-\nresponding railcars/bearings. Speci?cally, the double-layer\nhashing could be implemented as the following steps: \(1 using\nstandard SHA \(Secure Hash Algorithm  the second\nlayer hash table contains 1,000 keys \(railcars 1,000 keys \(note that for\nbetter ef?ciency the number of keys for each layer hash\nfunction should be balanced since the computation time of\nhashing increases with the total number of keys 2 the HBD records to their corresponding\nrailcars using the pre-computed double-layer hash function.\nWithin the readings of each railcar, usually a few hundreds,\nthe reading of a particular bearing can be easily aggregated\nto produce uni?ed feature vectors. Since hash function is\nsigni?cantly faster than string matching the running time of\ndata aggregation could be signi?cantly reduced.\nParallelization Further ef?ciency could be achieved using\nparallelization. Modern CPUs have more than one core on\na single chip. However, traditional programming languages\ncan only utilize one of them. If we parallelize the computa-\ntion to multiple cores/computers, then the overall of running\ntime would be reduced proportionally \(with the overheads of\nparallelization readings\nto their corresponding railcars. Due to the independence\nbetween railcars, searching the readings of one railcar will\nnot interfere with the searching of others. Parallelizing the\nhashing scheme would reduce the overall runtime of data\nmerging. In practice, this can be accomplished simply by\nrandomly dividing all readings into subsets, and then run\nhashing on them at the same time. In our implementation,\nwe adopt a standard parallel programming package, namely\nMPI. In addition, GPU computing also can be included for\nfurther ef?ciency, as there are naturally tons of cores on\nGPUs each of which can perform faster ?oating points than\na CPU.\nB. Dimension Reduction\nThrough data cleaning, we get the data of WILD, HBD\nreadings and alarms merged at bearing level. Totally, we\nhave 55 features extracted from the WILD and HBD data.\nFor ef?cient model development, we reduce the dimension\nof data using principal component analysis \(PCA  is to maximize the variance over a set of\ninstances. In our study, according to the results from cross\nvalidation, we kept 6 features \(projected using the eigen\nvectors 12 dimensions in total alarm prediction. The model\nis to predict whether a bearing will be alarmed at Level\n1 in 3 or 7 days. The predictions are completed using a\nvariant of SVM \(support vector machine  boundary that maximizes the margin\nbetween different classes. As our alarm prediction is a binary\nclassi?cation problem, namely either positive or negative, we\nstart with a linear classi?er where x is a feature description,\nsuch as bearing temperature and corresponding maximum\nwheel impact load, and y is the class label, i.e., alarm and\nnon-alarm. The formulation is as shown in Eq.\(1 1 hyperplane and b is offset, both of which\ntogether draw a decision boundary in the feature space.\nNow the problem turns to how to measure the success of\na classi?er. Following the intuition that the best separating\nhyperplane is the one which maximizes the margin between\nthe two classes, our goal is to minimize w? as 2?w? is the\nmargin between the binary classes. In addition, we relax the\nproblem using a non-negative soft margin” slack variable\n?. This allows the classi?cation result on the training set to\nbe slightly distant to \(on the wrong side of Formulation\nmin\nw,?\n1\n2\nwTw + C\nn?\ni=1\n?i \(2 w\nTxi + b 


that controls the trading-off between\nthe “margin” and the training error \(in terms of misclassi?ed\nlabels Because of the need for achieving very low false\npositive rate, we add in another non-negative parameter nwhich is used to reduce the number of samples that will\nbe labeled as positive. Generally, a large ? would produce\nless positive predictions, while a small ? predicts more\npositives. The ?rst constraint in Eq.\(2 enforces the penalty\nfor misclassi?cation, which tries to push every labeled\ninstances to the correct side of the classifying hyperplane.\n2 produce desirable accuracy, thereby\nnonlinear approaches are preferred if the computational com-\nplexity is not signi?cantly increased. A nonlinear classifying\nfunction could be easily obtained from a linear classi?er\nfollowed by a mapping function ?, which projects the\noriginal feature vectors to a higher dimensional space where\nthere is a better chance that more given labels are satis?ed.\nA kernel function, which characterizes a notion of pairwise\nsimilarity between instances, allows the nonlinearity of the\nlearning function without explicitly providing a mapping\nfunction ?. To make use of kernel, ?rstly we need to ?nd\nthe dual optimization of Eq.\(2 Karush-Kuhn-Tucker strong\nduality of the primal problem holds. Therefore the dual\nproblem can be derived using the standard procedure: the\nLagrange function L can be obtained by subtracting the\nproduct of the multiplier rst constraint in Eq.\(2 i=1\n?i\n\(\nyi\n\(\nwTxi + b\n i\n 3 i.e.\n?L\n?w\n= 0, we have\nw =\nn?\ni=1\n?iyixi \(4 to b and set it to zero,\n?L\n?b\n= 0 and then we have\nn?\ni=1\n?iyi = 0; \(5 4 into the Lagrange primal\nfunction L Eq.\(3 5 formulated as:\nThe Dual Formulation\nmax\n?\n?\nn?\ni=1\n?i ? 1\n2\nn?\ni=1\nn?\nj=1\n?i?jx\nT\ni xj \(6 0;\n0 ? ?i ?

Assume there is a mapping function ? that\nprojects feature vectors to a higher dimensional space, then\nxTi xj can be replaced by < ?\(xi xj in Eq.\(6  a new parameter ? instead of 1. In\naddition, practitioners may also consider using approxima-\ntion techniques and SMO \(sequential minimal optimization 6 implementation, we choose\nthe widely used kernel function for our alarm/failure pre-\ndiction problem, namely RBF \(radial basis function de?ned as:\nKij = e\n?\n\(xi ? x2j 7 regulate the complexity of predicting model.\nFinally, the training stage is operated as the following\nsteps 1 7 2 6 and\nrecover the optimal ? of the problem using constrained\nconvex program solver; \(3 solving\nwTxi + b ? 1 = 0 for active constraints. We shall in the\nnext subsection describe the usage of the variables ? and b\nlearned from training data in making predictions.\nD.

The output predicted alarms/failures are\nsorted in descending order based on the values of estimated\ncon?dence, such that the predicted alarms are arranged with\nrespect to their priority.\n11\nE Parameter Selection\nThere are three parameters in our failure prediction model\nthat we can tune to improve the prediction performance.\n• The parameter ? is the length scale of RBF kernel. The\nsmaller ?, the more complicated decision boundary the\nmodel will generate. Thus, the value of ? needs to be\nsmall enough to solve a dif?cult learning task. However,\n? should not be too small in order to avoid over?tting.\n• The parameter C is used to penalize the training errors.\nA large C is assigned to allow only a small number\nof misclassi?ed instances in the training process. This\nis desirable when the data is not noisy. However, the\nsensor readings in our application are very noisy due to\na series of factors, such as weather, temperature, instru-\nment measurement error, loss in signal transmitting, etc.\nIn this scenario, C should be relatively small otherwise\nit will force the model to memorize the noise and\nthereby mislead the classi?er. In addition, in our data,\nthe positive and negative samples are highly imbalanced\n\(only 1, 000 of alarm samples versus around 1 000, 000\nnegatives implicitly controls the number of sup-\nport vectors, which in turns manipulates the number of\npredicted 


positive railcars. When ? > 1 the model tends\nto have more support vector since there will be more\nactive constraints. This would produce a more complex\nprediction model, such that the false positive rate could\nbe lowered and the number of true positives would\nalso be reduced. Thereby, ? is mainly used to achieve\nan user-speci?ed false positive rate by sacri?cing true\npositive rate. As the expected false positive rate is\nextremely low in our prediction task, ? should be set\nto a value that is greater than 1. In addition, since each\nprediction in our model comes with a con?dence value,\nanother way to decrease the false positive rate is to\nsolely focus on the top priority alarms/failures which\nhave high estimated con?dence.\nIV. RULE SIMPLIFICATION\nTo make the output of our classi?cation model human-\ninterpretable, we perform an exhaustive grid search in entire\nfeasible feature space. Speci?cally, as the ?rst step, we\ndivide the feature space into non-overlapping small cells,\nall of which together cover the entire feature space. Then\nwe input the center point of each block into the prediction\nmodel, from which we can get a class assignment and the\ncorresponding prediction con?dence score. After obtaining\nthe class labels of all blocks, we can create sets of rules by\ncombining the ranges of all dimensions of each block.\nAs the feasible ranges for the features can be pre?xed\nbased on the possible ranges of sensor readings \(HBD and\nWILD rule logicaliza-\ntion is the step size of the granular search. Using a small\nstep size, higher learning performance can be achieved, but\nthe generated logical rules are complicated in terms of more\nclauses. With a large step size, the generated logical rules\ncontains less clauses, thus simple, but may not perform as\nwell as the ?ner grid search. Thus the complexity of the\nlogical rule is proportional to the step size; while the learning\nperformance is inversely proportional to the step size. This\nmay not always hold \(depends on how the feature space\nis divided Therefore, for a\nparticular problem, a reasonable step size should be the one\nfrom which we can achieve a desired prediction accuracy\n\(performance complexity is worth to note that if the search\ngrid is ?ne enough \(the step size is small enough could reach the exactly same learning performance as\nthat of the original nonlinear predicting model.\nV EMPIRICAL STUDY\nData. We have 7 months worth of HBD, WILD and\nalarm data from Sept 2011 to Mar 2012 covering about\n500,000 train cars in total. 100,00 non-alarmed cars are\nrandomly sampled. For those cars, we extract their HBD and\nWILD readings as non-alarm samples. 600 alarm records are\nsampled from 900 alarms and then merged with HBD and\nWILD data by bearing id and selected reading time window.\nCombining the non-alarm samples and alarm samples, we\nobtain the training sets.\nTo evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we use\ntwo measures, true positive rate \(sensitivity 1 - speci?city sensitivity,\nmeasures the proportion of actual positives which are cor-\nrectly identi?ed as such \(e.g., the percentage of the alarms\npredicted by the algorithm over total number of alarms proportion of negatives which are\ncorrectly identi?ed \(e.g., the percentage of non-alarms that\nare correctly identi?ed as not having the alarming condition 0.244%\nWILD 40.373% 0.211% 51.395% 0.269%\nHBD+ABD 26.906% 0.084% 31.824% 0.107%\nHBD+WILD+ABD 39.135% 0.120 44.596% 0.163%\nHBD+WILD 60.387% 0.199% 73.423% 0.211%\nTable I\nTRUE POSITIVE RATES AND FALSE POSITIVE RATES USING DIFFERENT\nCOMBINATION OF DATA SETS FOR 7-7 AND 14-3 SCENARIOS,\nRESPECTIVELY.\nTable I shows the performance using different combina-\ntions of detectors.

Comparison of decision functions with different complexities\nThe alarm prediction results are shown in Table II in\ntwo scenarios, 7-7 and 14-3, for illustration purpose Our\nalgorithm can achieve arbitrary high true positive rate \(with\ncorresponding trade-off in higher false positive with corresponding trade-off in lower\ntrue positive right tuning of parameter set. We show\nthree sets of results based on tolerance of false positives and\nrequirement of true positives, which itself stems from trade-\noff between maintenance cost and unexpected breakdown\ncost and associated decrease in network velocity. The ?rst\nset gives the highest true positive rates if the intent is to\ncapture as many true alarms as possible while disregarding\nthe false alarms. The second set keeps the number of false\nalarms below 20 per day, i.e., 0.014%, which is a rule-of-\nthumb benchmark used by the railroad with availability of\ntheir maintenance resources and personnel in mind. Under\nthis setting 


our method can capture about 38.5% of the\ntrue Level 1 alarms 7 days in advance or 45.4% 3 days in\nadvance For either of scenarios, our approach can reduce\nthe most severe alarms by more than 1/3 in either 7 or 3\ndays in advance compared to the current operations. Under\nthe other extreme, if the cost of false alarms is prohibitive,\nallowing for no false alarm, i.e., the false positive rate is\n0, then our method can still capture 7.5% Level 1 alarms 7\ndays in advance and 9.0% 3 days in advance without any\naddition cost.\nSimple v.s. complex decision function Figure 1 demon-\nstrate the complexity of the Level 1 alarm prediction prob-\nlem we are dealing with, where Figure 1\(a b the\nresult using a complex decision function. Regardless of the\ntrue positive, in this example we see that the false positive\nrate of the simple decision function is 16.7257%, which\nis de?nitely unacceptable as it is 1000 times beyond our\ntolerance. In contrast, the false positive rate of the complex\ndecision function is 0.2655 showing that our nonlinear\nmethod is worth to pursue. Consequently, we conclude that\nin order to achieve an acceptable false positive rate, complex\nnonlinear classi?cation technique is required.\nCoarse v.s. ?ne granular search with probability We\nshall now take a 2D example to illustrate the impact of\ngranular size in decision rule logicalization. A comparison\nof coarse and ?ne granular search is shown in Figure 2,\nwhere Figure 2\(a b blue im-\nplies normal, pink indicates alarm corresponding\nprobability \(increases as color goes from blue to red c 2\(d 1 classifying accuracy improves as the\ngrid size decreases, since in Figure 2\(a c increase from 34.5588% to 37.5000% while more\nimportantly the false positives decrease signi?cantly from\n8.4956% to 0.2655%; and \(2 positive\nrate signi?cantly, which can be observed in Figure 2\(a b 8.4956% to 4.070%,\nand in Figure 2\(c d It is worth noting the\ntradeoff between predicting accuracy and rule complexity.\nAlthough rules acquired from coarse grid search are easier\nto implement in practice, ?ner granular logicalization would\nproduce more classi?cation accuracy in terms of higher true\npositive rate and signi?cantly lower false rate.\n13\n\(a Decision map using coarse search \(b c d Probability map using ?ne search\nFigure 2. Performance comparison of granular rule logicalization\nVI CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we collaborate with a US Class I railroad\nand apply advanced analytics techniques to predict alarms\nassociated with catastrophic equipment failures several days\nahead of time. In this unique case study, we particularly\naddress the concerns of big data collected from about 1,000\ndetectors of multiple varieties using hashing and paral-\nlelization techniques. In addition, safety conscious and high\ncapital cost based industrial setting requires highly accurate\nprediction; posing challenge of only allowing extremely low\nfalse positive rate. We achieve this by modeling and tuning\na set of parameters in our customized SVM algorithm. More\nsigni?cantly, we develop the rule sets with the capabilities of\nhuman understanding and interpretation without sacri?cing\nthe prediction performance. These rule sets provide ef?cient\noperational decision support, meeting regulatory and indus-\ntry consortium requirements. Our work is able to provide\nsolutions to address the above concerns and effectively lower\nservice interruptions and improve network velocity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Tiwari, F. L. Lewis, and S. S.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
