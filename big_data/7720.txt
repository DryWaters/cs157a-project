This paper presents a perspective on endianness learning using 8-bit microcontroller units MCUs a practicable approach on assembly language arithmetic techniques, addressed to aid students in exploring big and little-endian ordering for handling memory storage. The proposed approach associates the study of endianness representation with a regular challenge in 8-bit microcontroller education, that is, the assembly-level arithmetic techniques for numbers extending one-byte range. The educational objective intended to be reached in this communication is to provide to the students a better understanding of the processor’s workings at the machine level, and help them in exploiting byte ordering towards to an optimum perfor mance of a low-level system implementation  Keywords  Assembly-level programming, big-endian representation, little-endian representation, integer arithmetic, microcontrollers I  I NTRODUCTION  Endianness in computing is referred to the attribute that describes data storage and accessing process of a multibyte integer value in computer’s memory. Processor architectures regularly store/access integers as sequence of bytes in which, numeric significance can be of either bigendian or little-endian ordering \(that is, a decreasing or increasing respectively byte ordering as memory is counted-up\or example, the four-byte \(4B\of 0x1234ABCD value would be represented at the very beginning of a 256B memory as follow: Big-endian 0x00:0x03 = 0x1234ABCD; Little-endian: 0x00:0x03 0xCDAB3412. In addition, some architectures feature biendian representation, which is referred to the capability of supporting both endian formats and is addressed for improving computers performance [1  I n t h i s  communication the authors propose a perspective on endianness learning, which is addressed in an assemblylevel tutoring system for 8-bit microcontroller units MCUs\e memory organization in small MCUs allows data storage and accessing process in consideration of user’s agreement during the assembly code development process. Although endianness concept is of great value for engin eers who are employing microcontrollers in their applications [2 itio n a l  approaches to education of small MCUs [3, 4  fail to provide an endianness scheme for handling memory storage. The approach presented in this paper proposes the association of endianness concept with a regular challenge in 8-bit microcontroller education, that is, the assemblylevel arithmetic techniques for numbers extending onebyte range The present effort is a part of an overall research on higher education, which is ca rried out at the Department of Communications, Informatics and Management, Epirus Educational Institute of Te chnology, Arta, Greece. Our lines of research are a concern of a revision of the traditional Computer Architecture course to Microcomputer Architecture [5 Thi s ch oi ce st em s from the need of taking active role in the demands and technologies that are, no wadays, shaping computing discipline. Regarding the fact that students within computing curricula might become programmers of general-purpose computers or embedded systems in their prospective careers contributions rely on the enhanced role of a new challenging course at expense of the traditional Computer Architecture. Due to the technological/professional natu re of the proposed course one aspect of our research is in reference with innovative practicable examinations of issues regularly studied by theory [9  Thi s pape r prese n t s  a n unc o nve nt i o na l perspective on endianness lear ning that is addressed to provide to the students a better understanding of the processor’s workings at the m achine level, and help them in exploiting byte ordering for the optimum performance of a low-level system implementation. Following a set of application examples involving arithmetic operations students have the opportunity to study the advanced 


601 handling techniques of memory storage by means of a practicable approach II  B ACKGROUND  Microcontrollers\222 technology is traditionally addressed to engineers of the electrical/electronic curriculum However, many reports on the migration of MCUs to allied engineering disciplines appear in the literature [12 C a se st u d i e s o n t h e e ducat i o n of b i ol ogi cal a n d  agricultural engineers [1 mechanical engineers [14   i n dust r i a l  engi neers  1 6  chem i cal engi neers  1 7 an d computer engineers r e some of the abundant propositions that have been posed in the literature over the last decades. It is generally accepted that a different educational approach should be engaged when teaching complex computerized system St ude nt s wh o  practically cannot have an in-depth understanding of all major technologies involved in a computerized system should focus on a certain are of interest only Our lines of research have been focused on the education of software engineers, in an attempt to provide more flexibility and less specialization in graduates together with an increased capability for design and innovation [2 The em pl oy m e nt of a sim p li fi ed embedded computer system \(i.e. an 8-bit MCU\ in the education of engineers with a background on software design issues was a concern of a reinforcing of the students\222 background on the hardware domain In consideration of the need for the incorporation of more content into engineering courses [2 o u r d eci si ons rel i e d on the encompassing of an 8-MCU into Computer Architecture class and therefore, a switching of the traditional course to Microcomputer Architecture. The present effort deals with a critical issue on computer architecture learning, i.e the endianness concept, and promotes its study by means of a practicable approach using 8-bit MCUs. Since endianness concept is regularly missing in traditional approaches to education of small MCUs [3,4 is co mm u n i cati on aims in the enhancement of the traditional tutoring methods. Regarding the widely employment of MCUs in various engineering disciplines 12-18 as we l l as t h e im port a nce of e n di anne ss co nce p t  to engineers who are employing microcontrollers in their applications e au tho r s anticipate the present effort would provide valuable feedback to educators who address MCUs to other th an electrical/electronic engineering students III  T HE P ROPOSED A PPROACH  The proposed approach a ssociates the study of endianness representation with a regular challenge in 8-bit microcontroller education, that is, the assembly-level arithmetic techniques for numbers extending one-byte 1B\ range. The examples presented hereafter deal with arithmetic operations of unsigned numbers in double-word i.e. 4B\ size length, assigned to memory either in big or little-endian ordering. In order to provide a clear scheme on endianness ordering for optimizing the performance of a low-level system implementation, number bytes are manipulated as being array elements in microcontroller\222s random access memory \(RAM\his particular technique promotes the advantages and disadvantages of byte ordering with reference to assembly code optimization and provides to the students the opportunity to study in detail the microcontroller\222s instructions set architecture ISA\ well as the advan ced handling techniques of memory storage. It is worth noting that, the proposed examples follow a sequence of lessons that are based on an interdisciplinary methodology for bridging the gap between low-level and high-level programmi a n d thus, students are already familiarized with indexing techniques for accessing array elements in RAM. The examples are in line with the MC68HC908GP32 [2  IS A  and focus on arithmetic additi on/subtraction, as well as multiplication/division by means of a shifting operation i.e. multiply/divide by 2 A  Addition/Subtraction Fig. 1 and 2 present the addition of two double-word numbers in big-endian and little-endian mode respectively. Fig. 1a\a\erform addition in a simplified process, while Fig. 1b\nd 2b\anipulate data that are organized in array   Fig. 1. Addition of double-word numbers in big-endian 


602 In both cases, addendum is assumed to be stored in memory locations 0x0040-0x0043, while adder is assumed to be stored in memory locations 0x00440x0047. Addresses 0x0048-0x4B are reserved for the sum Regarding, for example, an addendum of 0x1234ABCD value, the number is stored in memory as follow: Bigendian: \(0x0040=0x12, 0x0041=0x34, 0x0042=0xAB 0x0043=0xCD\dian: \(0x0040=0xCD 0x0041=0xAB, 0x0042=0x34, 0x0043=0x12\. Due to the fact that addition initiates from the least significant byte Fig. 1b\ uses an iterative loop with a decrement counter while Fig. 2b\ an in crement counter for accessing number bytes   Fig. 2. Addition of double-word numbers in little-endian The algorithm for the addition is achieved in lines 58 for big-endian mode \(Fig. 1b\d in lines 5-12 for little-endian mode \(Fig. 2b\while test expression of the loop is achieved in line 8 for the former case, and in lines 10-12 for the latter. At this point the students have the opportunity to compare the two kinds of endianness representation and reach to the result that, optimal implementation is achieved in big-endian mode because of the employment of the low-level compound instruction in line 8 \(DBNZ \226 decrement index register low and branch if not zero\. In addition, little-endian mode needs two more instructions \(lines 5 9\porary storage and subsequent retrieval of the condition code register \(CCR to/from accumulator \(TPA \226 tr ansfer processor status bytes to accumulator, TAP \226 transfer accumulator to processor status bytes\n order to understand the need for these particular instructions, the students have to study the effect on CCR of the instructions used in test expression DBNZ instruction does not have an effect on CCR carry flag and thus, it does not affect addition procedure However, CMPX \(compare index register low with memory\n affects carry flag \(which is subsequently evaluated by instruction BNE \226 branch if not equal\ and thus, a temporary storage of the carry flag should be taken into account Following the example of addition, students could straightforwardly revise a ddition to subtraction by switching ADC \(add with carry\n to SBC subtract with carry\Thus, the students have the opportunity to study the double service of carry flag which is used as carry during addition and borrow during subtraction. Those examples are addressed to provide to the students a deeper insight into the inner workings of the central processing unit \(CPU and help them enhance their programming skills at machine level as well. It is worth noting that, association of the endianness concept to low-level arithmetic operations provides a great opportunity on code optimiza tion practicing. Hereafter we give another example regarding a multiplication and division by 2   Fig. 3. Multiplication of a doubl e-word number in big-endian B  Multiplication/Division Fig. 3 and 4 present the multiplication \(by 2 double-word number in big-endian and little-endian mode respectively. Fig. 3a\ and 4a\ perform multiplication in a simplified process, while Fig. 3b\nd 4b\anipulate data that are organized in array In both cases, number is assumed to be stored in memory locations 0x0040-0x0043, while result is assumed to be stored in the same memory locations. Due 


603 to the fact that shift-left processes initiate from the least significant byte, Fig. 3b\uses an iterative loop with a decrement counter, while Fig 4b\ an increment counter for accessing number bytes. The algorithm for the multiplication is achieved in lines 5-6 for big-endian mode Fig. 3b\ lines 5-10 for little-endian mode \(Fig 4b\est expression of the loop is achieved in line 6 for the former case, and in lin es 8-10 for the latter   Fig. 4. Multiplication of a doubl e-word number in little-endian Accordingly, optimal implementation is achieved in big-endian mode because of the employment of the DBNZ instruction in line 6, while little-endian mode needs the two extra instructions \(lines 5, 7\ for the temporary storage and subsequent retrieval of the condition code register \(CCR from accumulator Regarding the division operation, shift-right processes initiate from the most significant byte and thus, optimal implementation is achieved in little-endian mode. Figure 5 and 6 present the division \(by 2\of a double-word number in big-endian and little-endian mode respectively Fig. 5a\d 6a\erform division in a simplified process, while Fig. 5b\d 6b\anipulate data that are organized in array. Moreover, ROL \(rotate left through carry\nstruction is switched to ROR \(rotate right through carry This particular example helps students clarify that bigendian mode does not consist an ideal byte ordering scheme. Therefore, students have to decide on the selection of the suitable representation mode according to the arithmetic operation being implemented. It is worth noting that the proposed addition/subtraction and multiplication/division examples are designed to fit within a two-hour lesson, while their assessment \(presented hereafter\reveal the positive contribution on students learning, in consideration of a clear scheme on endianness term \(by means of a pr acticable approach  Fig. 5. Division of a double-word number in big-endian   Fig. 6. Division of a double word number in little-endian IV  A SSESSMENT  Seventeen students partic ipated in an anonymous questionnaire regarding the assessment of the proposed approach. The questionnaire was administrative to each student at the end of this particular lesson. Table 1 summarizes the results of the assessment survey, where scores \(1\o \(5\and for \223at all\224, \223shortly\224, \223enough\224 223much\224 and \223very much\224 respectively. \(AV\for average The first question explores the effectiveness of the proposed practicable approach on endianness learning while the next two explore the value of the proposed approach on the obtaining of its educational benefits. The high score in the first question confirms that a practicable perspective on endianness learning is more appropriate than a theoretical one. Positive results of the two subsequent questions find students agreed with the effectiveness of the pr oposed approach on the 


604 understanding of the a\dvanced handling techniques of memory storage and b\ exploiting of endianness representation towards to an optimum performance of a low-level system implementation. The higher score in the second question is fair enough, since students have already been introduced to more sophisticated methods for code optimization techniques, by means of macroinstructions [8, 9  What is ev en m o re pro m isin g is th e fact that none of the students believes the current method helped in the conception of endianness learning at all Table I A SSESSMENT S URVEY  Scores Questions 1\\(AV Do you believe that a practicable approach on big-endian & littleendian representation provides a better understanding of these terms compared to a theoretical approach 6 6 4 1 0 4 Did the lesson help understand the advanced handling techniques of memory storage for an 8-bit microcontroller 3 5 7 2 0 3.53 Did the lesson help you understand how to exploit endianness modes for an optimum performance of a lowlevel system implementation 1 4 10 2 0 3.24  V  C ONCLUSION  This paper has presented an unconventional approach on endianness learning based on assembly-level programming for 8-bit microcontrollers. The proposed approach relied on the association of endianness representation with the assembly-level arithmetic techniques for numbers extending one-byte range, as a supporting scheme towards to a better understanding of the a\dvanced handling techniques of memory storage b\xploiting of byte ordering formats for the optimum performance of a low-level system implementation.

In the ideal amplifier case both the BPSK and 12-4 QAM meet the ACI mask with OBO=3 dB The hump in the BPSK lobe is the result of it being statistically more likely to have a zero-crossing in BPSK modulation than 12-4 QAM In addition an OBO of 3 dB is similar to IPAPR95 implying that IPAPR95 may be a reasonable offset factor between linear and saturated EIRP The second case of study is simulation of memory-less nonlinear models such as AM-AM and AM-PM The manufacturers provided large-signal measurement-based AM-AM and AM-PM models of SSPAs A and B to simulate using the LLAT software The spectral re-growth of these models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a shows the onset of spectral re-growth much earlier than the ideal amplifier case Since SSPAs A and B have different AM-AM characteristics shown as power compression curves in Figure 1 and Figure 2 the re-growth characteristics are also different between the two models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a for SSPA A and Figure 7\(a and Figure 8\(a for SSPA B Although the memory-less non-linear models show larger re-growth than the ideal amplifier model for both BPSK and 12-4 QAM they provide an optimistic expectation of only a few dB OBO requirement for most spectral masks The third case of study is a measurement of the two SSPA devices using LLAT Each device is characterized using BPSK and 12-4 QAM waveforms at 3.75 and 15 Msps In the case of SSPA A the device without significant memory effects BPSK modulation at the two data rates shown in Figure 5\(b and Figure 5\(c match closely with the model simulation in Figure 5\(a A degradation of a few dB in spectral re-growth is observed when comparing the measured data and the model The measurements also match closely with the model for 12-4 QAM shown in Figure 6\(b and Figure 6\(c 5 CONCLUSION During the early planning and design phase of a SATCOM terminal it is important to predict the expected radiated power from a transmitting amplifier This is especially true for small mobile terminals where size weight and power are at a premium Under these conditions the transmitting amplifiers must be optimized for power efficiency and linearity Understanding how the non-linear effects of an amplifier distort a waveform is a difficult task especially when limited to single-tone data Simulations show that a few dB of OBO is required to meet an ACI mask of 30 dBc even with in an ideal power-limited amplifier IPAPR95 of a waveform is a reasonable estimate for required OBO Measurements indicate that it is possible to realize Q-band solid-state amplifiers that approximate an ideal power-limited amplifier however care must be taken not to add memory into the device when optimizing it for high-power and high-efficiency performance Future work will investigate the limitations of two-tone measurements in predicting distortion since two-tone waveforms have a limited PAPR 5 LLAT is capable of fully interrogating an amplifier in order to develop highfidelity behavioral models 6 7 Ongoing work aims to understand how millimeter-wave solid-state and travelingwave tube amplifier distortions relate to ACI EVM and BER as data rate increases However SSPA B which has strong memory presents two effects The first is degradation in spectral re-growth in the first side-band region of 5 to 10 dB for the lower data rate shown in Figure 7\(b for BPSK and Figure 8\(b for 12-4 QAM The higher data rate has 10 to 15 dB degradation in the first side band shown in Figure 7\(c and Figure 8\(c The second effect is the asymmetry in the re-growth between the highand low-side bands The memory-less non-linear model based on single-tone measurements of SSPA B does not make any predictions of side-band asymmetry The strong memory in SSPA B was determined to be the result of bias circuitry originally designed for maximum power and efficiency using single-tone measurements Modifications to the bias network improved the performance and significantly reduced the memory effects 6

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
