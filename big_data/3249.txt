QLD4001 Australia g4.shaw@student.qut.edu.au Abstract The quality of association rule mining has drawn more and more attention recently One problem with the quality of the discovered association rules is the huge size of the extracted rule set Often for a dataset a huge number of rules can be extracted but many of them can be redundant to other rules and thus useless in practice Mining non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solve this problem In this paper we rstly propose a deìnition for redundancy then we propose a concise representation called Reliable basis for representing nonredundant association rules for both exact rules and approximate rules We prove that the redundancy elimination based on the Reliable basis does not reduce the belief to the extracted rules We also prove that all association rules can be deduced from the Reliable basis Therefore the Reliable basis is a lossless representation of association rules Experimental results show that the Reliable basis signiìcantly reduces the number of extracted rules Index Terms Association rule mining redundant association rules closed itemsets generator certainty factor I I NTRODUCTION One big problem in association mining is the huge amount of the extracted rules which severely hinders the effective use of the discovered knowledge Moreover many of the extracted rules produce no value to the user or can be replaced by other rules thus considered redundant Many efforts have been made on reducing the size of the extracted rule set The approaches can be roughly divided to two categories subjective approach and objective approach In the subjective approach category one technique is to deﬁne various interestingness measures and only the rules which are considered interesting based on the interesting measurements are 3 Another technique in this category is to apply constraints or templates to generate only those rules that satisfy the constraints or templates 8 10 14 In the objecti v e approach cate gory  the main technique is to construct concise representative bases of association rules without using user-dependent constraints A concise representative basis contains much smaller number of rules and is considered lossless since all association rules can be derived from the basis A number of concise representations of frequent patterns have been proposed one of them namely the closed itemsets is of particular interest as they can be applied for generating non-redundant rules  11 17 The notion of closed frequent itemset has its origins in the mathematical theory of Formal Concept Analysis FCA introduced in the early 15 FCA has over the years grown to a powerful theory for data analysis information retrieval and knowledge discovery The use of frequent closed itemsets presents a clear promise to reduce the number of extracted rules and also provides a concise representation of association rules 18 Ev en though the number of generated rules can be reduced drastically by only using frequent closed itemsets however a considerable amount of redundancy still remains Our work will be in this category to construct concise representatives of association rules based on closed itemsets for effective redundancy reduction The redundancy elimination should consider three aspects removing as much redundancy as possible ensuring that the extracted rules retain the same inference capacity and being able to deduce all associations In this paper we propose a concise representation basis of association rules called Reliable basis We adopt a similar deﬁnition of non-redundant association rules that have minimal antecedents and maximal consequents as deﬁned by Pasquier et al Ho we v e r  our deﬁnition relaxes or reduces the requirements to redundancy and thus much more redundant rules can be eliminated compared to Pasquier’s approach Most importantly in this paper we show that the redundancy elimination based on the proposed Reliable basis will not reduce the inference capacity of the extracted non-redundant rules The certainty factor CF is an important and popular used measure of belief to inference rules W e pro v e that the redundant rules eliminated by our approach have less or equal CF belief values than that of their corresponding non-redundant rules which are extracted and thus the elimination of such rules will not reduce the belief to the extracted rules Moreover we prove that the reliable basis is a lossless representation of association rules since all association rules can be deduced from the reliable basis The paper is organized as follows The basic concepts of association rule mining are given in Section 2 In Section 3 we rstly propose a deﬁnition to redundancy and then discuss the elimination of the redundancy Section 4 rstly introduces the proposed reliable association rule basis for extracting non-redundant rules then presents a method to derive all association rules from the reliable basis Experimental results are given in Section 5 Section 6 brieﬂy discusses some related work Finally Section 7 concludes the paper 94 1-4244-2 3 84-2/08/$20.00 c  2008 IEEE

different identiﬁable transactions An association rule is an implication in the form of X  Y  where X Y  I are sets of items called itemsets and X  Y    Association rule mining is to nd out association rules that satisfy the predeﬁned minimum support denoted as minsupp conﬁdence denoted as mincof from a given database The problem is usually decomposed into two subproblems to nd frequent itemsets and to generate association rules from those frequent itemsets For the popular used Mushroom dataset http://kdd.ics.uci.edu with minimal support 0.8 and minimal conﬁdence 0.8 we can generate 88 association rules Table I displays 20 of the 88 association rules The deﬁnition of closed itemsets comes from the closure operation of the Galois connection Let I denote the set of items and T denote the set of transactions 2 I and 2 T are the power set of I and T  respectively  i  I and  t  T  if item i appears in transaction t  then i and t has a binary relation  denoted as it  The Galois connection of the binary relation is deﬁned by the following mappings where X  I  Y  T   2 I  2 T   X   t  T  i  X it  1  2 T  2 I   Y   i  I  t  Y it  2   X  is called the transaction mapping of X    Y  is called the item mapping of Y      X   called the closure of X  gives the common items among the transactions each of which contains X  Deﬁnition 1 Frequent Closed Itemsets Let X be a subset of I  X is a frequent closed itemset iff     X  X and X is a frequent itemset Deﬁnition 2 Generators An itemset g  2 I is a generator of a closed itemset c  2 I iff c      g  and g      g

percentage of transactions which contain X  i.e supp  X     X     T   For the Mushroom dataset the closed itemsets and their minimal generators minsupp=0.8 are given in Table II From Deﬁnition 2 we can get that g  c is true for any generator g and its closed itemset c  III R EDUNDANCY IN A SSOCIATION R ULES A challenge to association mining is the huge amount of the extracted rules Recent studies have shown that using closed itemsets and generators to extract association rules can greatly reduce the number of extracted rules 17 However considerable amount of redundancy still exists in the extracted association rules based on closed itemsets Therefore techniques are needed to remove the redundancy for generating high quality association rules An important issue related to redundancy elimination is the deﬁnition of redundancy The scope of the redundancy must be carefully and fairly deﬁned so that the reduction won’t cause information loss or reduce the belief to the resulting rules Any information loss or belief degradation will cause the quality deterioration of the extracted rules which makes the redundancy reduction not worthwhile In this section we start with some examples to show the existence of redundancy in extracted rules following that we give a deﬁnition of redundant rules to be removed and then we prove that the elimination of the deﬁned redundancy won’t reduce the belief to the extracted non-redundant rules In Section 4 we describe a concise representation of the deﬁned non-redundant association rules from which all association rules can be derived A Redundancy Deﬁnition The rules in Table I are considered useful based on the predeﬁned minimum support and conﬁdence However some of the rules actually do not contribute new information The consequent concluded by some rules can be obtained from some other rules without requiring more conditions but with higher or the same conﬁdences For example in order to be red the rules 5 8 13 and 20 in Table I require more 2008 I EEE I nt er nat io nal Co nf ere n ce o n S yst e ms M an an dC y ber n e t ic s SMC 2008 9 5 


conditions than that of rules 2 6 11 and 9 respectively but conclude the same or less results which can be produced by rules 2 6 11 and 9 That means without rules 5 8 13 and 20 we still can achieve the same result using other rules Therefore rules 5 8 13 and 20 are considered redundant to rules 2 6 11 and 9 respectively Comparing to rules 2 6 11 and 9 the redundant rules 5 8 13 and 20 have a longer or the same antecedent and a shorter or the same consequent respectively and the conﬁdence of the redundant rules is not larger than that of their corresponding non-redundant rules The following deﬁnition deﬁnes such kind of redundant rules Deﬁnition 4 Redundant rules Let X  Y and X   Y  be two association rules with conﬁdence cf and cf   respectively X  Y is said a redundant rule to X   Y  if X   X  Y  Y   and cf  cf   Based on Deﬁnition 4 for an association rule X  Y  if there does not exist any other rule X   Y  such that the conﬁdence of X   Y  is the same as or larger than the conﬁdence of X  Y  X   X or Y  Y   then X  Y is non-redundant In terms of the size of antecedent and consequent Deﬁnition 4 is similar to Pasquier’s deﬁnition of min-max association rules  Ho we v e r  P asquier s deﬁnition requires that a r edundant rule and its conrresponding non-redundant rule must have identical conﬁdence and identical support while Deﬁnition 4 here only requires that the conﬁdence of the redundant rule is not larger than that of its corresponding non-redundant rule In the following subsection we prove that the requirement relaxation to redundancy will not reduce the belief to the extracted non-redundant rules B Reliable Redundancy Elimination The certainty factor theory were rst introduced in MYCIN  to e xpress ho w accurate and truthful a r ule is and ho w reliable the antecedent of the rule is The certainty factor theory is based on two functions measure of belief MB  X Y  and measure of disbelief MD  X Y  for a rule X  Y asgiven below MB  X Y   1 P  Y  0 P  Y/X   P  Y  P  Y/X   P  Y   1  P  Y  otherwise 3 MD  X Y   1 P  Y  0 P  Y/X   P  Y  P  Y   P  Y/X  P  Y  otherwise 4 where in the context of association rules P  Y/X  and P  Y  are the conﬁdence of the rule and the support of the consequent respectively The values of MB  X Y  and MD  X Y  range between 0 and 1 measuring the strength of belief or disbelief in consequent Y given antecedent X  MB  X Y  weighs how much the antecedent X increases the possibility of Y occurring If the antecedent completely support the consequent then P  Y/X  will equal to 1 thus MB  X Y  will be 1 MD  X Y  1 indicates that the antecedent completely denies the consequent thus the disbelief in the rule reaches its highest value The total strength of belief or disbelief in the association captured by the rule is measured by the certainty factor which is deﬁned as follows CF  X Y  MB  X Y   MD  X Y  5 The value of a certainty factor is between 1 and 1 Negative values represent cases where the antecedent is against the consequent positive values represent that the antecedent supports the consequent while CF 0 means that the antecedent does not inﬂuence the belief to Y  Obviously association rules with high CF values are more useful since they represent strong positive associations between antecedents and consequents Indeed the aim of association rule mining is to discover strong positive associations from large amount of data Therefore we propose that the certainty factors can be used to measure the strength of discovered association rules Theorem 1 below states that the CF value of a redundant rule deﬁned by Deﬁnition 4 will never be larger than the CF value of its corresponding non-redundant rules It means that the association between the antecedent and consequent of the non-redundant rule is stronger than that of the redundant rule Theorem 1 Let X  Y and X   Y  be two association rules If Y   Y  and P  Y/X   P  Y  X    then CF  X Y   CF  X  Y    Proof From Equation 5 we have CF  X Y  CF  X  Y    MB  X Y  MB  X  Y    MD  X  Y   MD  X Y  1 Assuming that P  Y  X    P  Y    From condition Y   Y  we have P  Y   P  Y    Because P  Y/X   P  Y  X    so we have P  Y/X   P  Y   In this case MD  X  Y   MD  X Y   0 To prove the theorem we need to prove that MB  X Y  MB  X  Y    0 FromEquation\(3\,wehave MB  X Y  MB  X  Y    P  Y/X   P  Y  1  P  Y   P  Y  X    P  Y   1  P  Y     P  Y/X   P  Y  1  P  Y     P  Y  X    P  Y   1  P  Y  1  P  Y  1  P  Y    P  Y/X   P  Y  X   P  Y  X   P  Y   P  Y/X  P  Y    P  Y  P  Y   1  P  Y  1  P  Y   Let   P  Y/X   P  Y  X    the above expression becomes    P  Y  X   P  Y      P  Y  X   P  Y    P  Y  P  Y   1  P  Y  1  P  Y      P  Y  X   P  Y   P  Y    P  Y  X   P  Y    P  Y  P  Y   1  P  Y  1  P  Y     1  P  Y   P  Y  X    P  Y   P  Y    P  Y  P  Y   1  P  Y  1  P  Y     1  P  Y    P  Y    P  Y  1  P  Y  X   1  P  Y  1  P  Y   Because P  Y   P  Y   and P  Y/X   P  Y  X   which makes   0  we prove that the above expression  0  Hence MB  X Y  MB  X  Y    0 2 Assuming that P  Y  X    P  Y    In this situation we have two cases i P  Y/X   P  Y  In this case MB  X Y  MB  X  Y    0 To prove the theorem we need to prove that MD  X  Y   MD  X Y   0  From Equation 4 we have MD  X  Y   MD  X Y   P  Y    P  Y  X   P  Y    P  Y   P  Y/X  P  Y  After expanding the above expression and eliminating identical dual terms we have MD  X  Y   MD  X Y   P  Y/X  P  Y    P  Y  X   P  Y  P  Y  P  Y     P  Y/X  P  Y    P  Y/X  P  Y  P  Y  P  Y    Again since P  Y   P  Y   weget MD  X  Y   MD  X Y   0  ii P  Y/X   P  Y  In this case MD  X Y  0 and MB  X  Y    0 To prove the theorem we need to prove that MD  X  Y    MB  X Y   0  Because P  Y  X    P  Y   and P  Y/X   P  Y   from the equations 3 and 4 it is 96 2008 I EEE I nt er nat io nal

true that MD  X  Y    MB  X Y   0 Combining the results of the above cases we have CF  X Y  CF  X  Y    0  hence CF  X Y   CF  X  Y    According to Theorem 1 the CF value of a redundant rule deﬁned by Deﬁnition 4 is never higher than that of its corresponding non-redundant rule and thus the elimination of such redundant rules is reliable since it won’t reduce the belief to the extracted non-redundant rules IV C ONCISE B ASES R EPRESENTING N ON REDUNDANT A SSOCIATION R ULES Developing concise and lossless representations is a promising way to improve the quality of the discovered associations Some work has been done in this area 9 12 18 Pasquier et al proposed tw o condensed bases to represent non-redundant association rules which are deﬁned as follows Deﬁnition 5 Min-max

basis is M inM axExact   g   c  g   c  C g  G c g   c  Rules with conﬁdence less than 1 are called Approximate rules and rules with conﬁdence equal to 1 are called Exact rules For the 88 rules extracted from the Mushroom dataset mentioned above there are 17 exact rules and 71 approximate rules Based on the Min-max approximate basis and the Minmax exact basis only 9 exact rules and 25 approximate rules as displayed in Table III and Table IV are extracted and considered non-redundant in terms of the redundancy deﬁnition given in  Ho we v e r  under Deﬁnition 4 some of the rules extracted from the min-max bases are redundant such as rules 5 6 and 7 in Table III which are redundant to rules 1 and 2 in the same table and rules 21 to 25 in Table IV which are redundant to rules 17 11 10 and 16 respectively A Reliable Bases Corresponding to the two Min-max bases we propose two more concise bases called Reliable bases as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 7 and Deﬁnition 8 Using the Reliable bases more redundant rules can be eliminated Deﬁnition 7 Reliable Approximate Basis Let C be the set of frequent closed itemsets and G be the set of minimal generators of the frequent closed itemsets

B Deriving Association Rules from the Reliable Bases The proposed reliable bases are lossless which means that from the bases we can construct all association rules without scanning the dataset Algorithms have been proposed to derive all association rules from the Min-max bases and the Reliable Exact basis In this section we pro vide an algorithm that can derive all approximate rules from the Reliable Approximate basis As showed at the beginning of this section the Min-max approximate basis which is a super set of the Reliable approximate basis still contains redundancy Based on the deﬁnitions 5 and 7 the Min-max Approximate basis can be described as M inM axApprox   g   c  g   c  C g  G     g   c    g   c  g   c  C g  G    g   c  c    g   or conf  g  c  g  conf  g   c   g   for all c   C g   G     g  012 c or  g   c  c    g   and conf  g  c  g   conf  g   c   g   for some c   C g   G     g   012 c     g   c  g   c  C g  G c    g   c  c    g   or conf  g  c  g  conf  g   c   g   for all c   C g   G     g  012 c   g   c  g   c  C g  G c  g   c  c    g   and conf  g  c  g   conf  g   c   g   for some c   C g   G     g   012 c    ReliableApprox  N onReliableApprox Where N onReliableApprox   g   c  g   c  C g  G c  6 g 015  c  c    g   and conf  g  c  g   conf  g   c   g   for some c   C g   G     g    c   The following theorem showes that for r 2  g 2  c 2  g 2  c 2  C and g 2  G i.e r 2 is a rule in M inM axApprox  if for some c 1  C and some g 1  G  there is  g 1 015  c 1  c 2   g 2  and conf  r 1   conf  r 2   then we can deduce r 1  g 1  c 1  g 1 is a rule in N onReliableApprox  This means that from a rule in M inM axApprox  we could deduce a N onReliableApprox rule Theorem 3 Let C be the set of frequent closed itemsets and G be the set of minimal generators For rules r 1  g 1  c 1  g 1 and r 2  g 2  c 2  g 2 where c 1  c 2  C  g 1  g 2  G      g 1   c 1  and     g 2   c 2  r 1 is a NonReliable approximate rule iff  g 1 015  c 1  c 2   g 2  and conf  r 1   conf  r 2   Proof 1   According to the deﬁnition of Min-max approximate basis both r 1  g 1  c 1  g 1 and r 2  g 2  c 2  g 2 are Min-max approximate rules If g 1 015  c 1  c 2   g 2 and conf  r 1   conf  r 2   then   g 1 015  c 1  c 2   g 2  must be false According to the deﬁnition of Reliable approx basis r 1   ReliableApprox must be true Therefore r 1  N onReliableApprox is true 2   Assuming that r 1  g 1  c 1  g 1  N onReliableApprox  From Equation 6 we immediately get g 1 015  c 1  c 2   g 2  and conf  r 1   conf  r 2  for some c 2  C  and g 2  G   We designed the following algorithm AllApproxF romReliable to derive all approximate rules from the Reliable Approx basis The algorithm AllApproxF romReliable takes ReliableApprox as the initial value for M inM axApprox  Steps 4-8 generate approximate rules from an approximate basis rule in current M inM axApprox  Steps 9 to 14 deduce N onReliableApprox basis rules and add them into the current M inM axApprox  Therefore during the process of deriving approximate rules we generates all N onReliableApprox rules so that M inM axApprox will be completed progressively during the course Theorem 3 ensures that we can deduce all N onReliableApprox basis rules On completion of executing Algorithm 2 M inM axApprox will contains all ReliableApprox basis rules and also all N onReliableApprox basis rules Steps 17 to 21 in Algorithm 2 derive all approximate rules from these basis rules which performs the same task as the steps 11 to 17 in the approximate reconstruction algorithm proposed in Algorithm 2 AllApproxFromReliable  ReliableApprox  Input ReliableApprox  reliable approximate basis Output AllApprox  A set of all approximate association rules 1 AllExact    M inM axApprox  ReliableApprox 2 for i 2 to maximum size of closed itemsets 3 for rule  r 1  a 1  c 1 r 1 supp r 1 conf   M inM axApprox and  c 1   i 4 for subset c 2  c 1 5 if  r 2  a 1  c 2 r 2 supp r 2 conf    AllApprox 6 and r 2 conf  1  r 2 is not an exact rule 7 then AllApprox  AllApprox    r 2  a 1  c 2 r 1 supp r 1 conf   8 end-for 9 for each closed itemset c 3 10 for generator a such that a 015 a 1 and a.closure  c 3 11 if a 015  c 3   c 1  a 1   a 1  and r 1 conf  c 3 supp a.supp 12 then M inM axApprox  M inM axApprox   a   c 3  a  c 3 supp c 3 supp a.supp  13 end-for 14 end-for 15 end-for 16 end-for 17 for rule  r 1  a 1  c 1 r 1 supp r 1 conf   AllApprox 18 for each subset c 3  c 2 where c 2  a 1 closure  a 1   a 1 closure  supp a 1 supp 1 19 AllApprox  AllApprox   a 1  c 3  c 1  c 3 r 1 supp r 1 conf  20 end-for 2008 I EEE I nt er nat io nal Co nf ere n ce o n S yst e ms M an an dC y ber n e t ic s SMC 2008 99 


21 end-for 22.return AllExact V E VA L UAT I O N We have conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Reliable approximate basis This section presents the experimental results A Datasets We used the following three datasets from UCI KDD Archive http://kdd.ics.uci.edu The Mushrooms dataset contains 8,124 records each of which describes the characteristics of one mushroom object Each mushroom object has 23 attributes some of which are multiple value attributes After converting the multiple value attributes to binary ones the number of attributes of each object becomes 126 The Annealing dataset contains 898 annealing instances objects each has 38 attributes After converting multiple value attributes to binary ones each object has 276 attributes The Flare2 dataset contains 1,066 solar are instances each of which represents captured features for one active region on the sun Each are instance has 50 attributes after the multiple value attributes are converted to binary attributes The experiment is to nd the associations among attributes for the three datasets B Experiment Results We have reported the evaluation result for the Reliable exact basis in In this section we will e v a luate the effectiveness of the proposed Reliable Approximate basis on eliminating redundancy We have proved in Section IV that the Reliable bases are more concise than the MinMax bases and thus should contain less number of basis rules We have also proved in Section IV that from the Reliable bases we can deduce all approximate association rules In this experiment rstly we conﬁrmed that both the MinMax basis and the Reliable basis can deduce all approximate rules For example when Minsupp is 0.3 both bases produce 21,377 approximate rules for the Mushroom dataset as showed in Table V Secondly we tested the reduction ratio between the size of the M inM axApprox basis and the size of the ReliableApprox basis for different Minsupp settings For all tests the minconf was set to 0.5 Table V Table VI and Table VII present the test results for the three datasets respectively The experiment results showed that the reduction is considerable high For instance when Minsupp was set to 0.3 for the Annealing dataset the MinMax basis contains 865 basis rules as showed in Table VI while the Reliable basis contains 554 basis rules the reduction ratio is 36 In this case 5,052 approximate rules can be deduced either from the MinMax basis or from the Reliable basis For example the following 9 rules in the MinMax basis are redundant to the reliable rule steel-A  product-type-C,strength-000 0.4844 0.9886 therefore they are excluded in the Reliable basis TABLE V N UMBER OF APPROXIMATE RULES M USHROOM DATASET  MINCONF 0.5  Approx rules derived MinMax Reliable

steel-A,carbon-00,bore-0000,class-3  product-type-C,strength-000 0.3653,0.9850 The 9 rules listed above have the same consequent but a larger antecedent than that of the reliable rule steel-A  product-type-C,strength-000  Both the support and conﬁdence values  as indicated as support conﬁdence at the end of each rule of these 9 rules are smaller than that of the reliable rule Therefore according to Theory 1 their CF value won’t be greater than that of the reliable rule In real world problem solving if we know that steel-A is true by applying the rule steel-A  product-type-C,strength-000  we can conclude that product-type-C,strength-000 is true We don’t have to know hardness-00  class-3 or bore-0000  etc in order to reach this consequence That means all the 9 rules are useless or redundant if we have the rule steel-A  product-typeC,strength-000 at hand Eliminating these redundant rules can greatly reduce the size of the discovered rule set but the capacity of the rule base in solving problems remains the same VI R ELATED W ORK One approach on addressing the quality of association rules is to apply constraints to generate only those association rules that are interesting to users based on some constraints TABLE VII N UMBER OF APPROXIMATE RULES F LARE 2 DATASET  MINCONF 0.5 Approx rules derived MinMax Reliable Reduction Minsupp

 and 14 proposed some algorithms that incorporate item constraints to the process of generating frequent itemsets Also some works have been done on measuring association rules with interestingness parameters These approaches focus on pruning the association rules to get more general or informative association rules based on interestingness parameters The approach proposed in inte grates v arious constraints into mining process including consequent constraint and minimal improvement constraint as well The consequent constraint is used to restrict rules with certain consequent speciﬁed by the user while minimal improvement constraint is used to simplify the antecedents of rules based on item’s contribution to the conﬁdence and therefore prune association rules that have more speciﬁc antecedent but do not make more contribution to the conﬁdence Another approach is to use a taxonomy of items to extract generalized association rules i.e to generate rules between itemsets that belong to different abstract levels in the taxonomy especially between high abstract levels aiming at reducing the number of extracted rules The approaches mentioned above aim at reducing the number of extracted rules and also improving the“usefulness of the rules but eliminating redundancy of rules is not a focus The approaches proposed in and 12 focus on extracting non-redundant rules Both of them make use of the closure of the Galois connection t o e xtract non-redundant rules from frequent closed itemsets instead of from frequent itemsets One difference between the two approaches is the deﬁnition of redundancy The approach proposed in e x tracts the rules with shorter antecedent and shorter consequent as well among rules which have the same conﬁdence while the method proposed in deﬁnes that the non-redundant rules are those which have minimal antecedents and maximal consequents Our deﬁnition to redundant rules is similar to that of Ho we v e r  the requirement to redundanc y i s r elax ed and the less requirement makes more rules to be considered redundant and thus eliminated Most importantly we prove that the elimination of such redundant rules does not reduce the belief to the extracted rules and the capacity of the extracted non-redundant rules for solving problems will also not be reduced The concept of non-derivable itemsets was introduced in The basic idea is to nd lo wer and upper bounds on the support of an itemset based on the support of its subsets When these bounds are equal the itemset is considered derivable The set of frequent non-derivable itemsets allows for deriving the supports of all other frequent itemsets and as such forms a concise representation from which all other frequent itemsets can be derived Goethals proposed a method to derive non-derivable rules from the non-derivable itemsets The amount of the non-derivable rules is much smaller than the size of the entire rule set However it was not discussed whether the non-derivable rule set has the same capacity to solve problems as the entire rule set VII C ONCLUSION One challenge problem with association rule mining is the redundancy in association rules which greatly affects the use of the extracted rules in solving real world problems The work presented in this paper aims at improving the quality of association rules by eliminating redundancy In this paper we proposed a relaxed deﬁnition of redundancy and a concise representation of association rules called Reliable basis We theoretically proved and experimentally conﬁrmed that the proposed Reliable basis can eliminate considerable amount of redundancy Based on certainty factor theory we also proved that the elimination of the redundancy using the proposed Reliable basis does not reduce the belief to the extracted rules Similar to the Min-max basis the proposed Reliable basis is not only a concise but also a lossless representation of association rules From the Reliable basis all association rules can be deduced R EFERENCES  R J Bayardo R Agra w al and D Gunopulos Constraint-based rule mining in large dense databases Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  4:217–240 2000  M J A Berry and G S Linof f

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as ìfor manyî, ìthere are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logicî, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e compositionî, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
