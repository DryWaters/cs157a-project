204Many high performance large-scale storage systems will experience signi\223cant workload increases as their user base and content availability grow over time The U.S Geological Survey USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science EROS center hosts one such system that has recently undergone a period of rapid growth as its user population grew nearly 400 in just about three years When administrators of these massive storage systems face the challenge of meeting the demands of an ever increasing number of requests the easiest solution 
is to integrate more advanced hardware to existing systems However additional investment in hardware may signi\223cantly increase the system cost as well as daily power consumption In this paper we present evidence that well-selected software level optimization is capable of achieving comparable levels of performance without the cost and power consumption overhead caused by physically expanding the system Speci\223cally we develop intelligent prefetching algorithms that are suitable for the unique workloads and user behaviors of the world\220s largest satellite images distribution system managed by USGS EROS Our experimental results derived from real-world traces with 
over 223ve million requests sent by users around the globe show that the EROS hybrid storage system could maintain the same performance with over 30 of energy savings by utilizing our proposed prefetching algorithms compared to the alternative solution of doubling the size of the current FTP server farm

I I NTRODUCTION Massive scale storage systems often face dif\223culties on two fronts as time passes First they must grapple with the problem of data expansion as new more current information is 
added to a repository alongside many older but still valuable pieces of information Second as the system and its provided services gain more attention and popularity user population will increase constantly over time This will inevitably demand higher performance for existing systems Administrators of massive storage systems cannot attempt to solve one issue but ignore the other as both are integral components in allowing unhindered growth The USGS EROS is the United States\220 of\223cial repository of civilian terrestrial imagery and it hosts the world\220s largest satellite images distribution system containing many petabytes of satellite data Every day high resolution images of the Earth are taken by the orbiting Landsat satellites and added 
to EROS\220 ever-expanding library of satellite data In October 2008 EROS opened their vast amounts of archived satel 
Fig 1 The monthly satellite images download requests of EROS grow by almost 400 during Oct.2008 Feb.2011 lite images to the public for free which prompts a large and continuous growth of the user base of EROS system In about three years the number of monthly requests for images received by EROS has nearly quadrupled as shown in Figure 1 This number is expected to grow constantly in the future To provide high quality service for a rapidly growing number of customers EROS needs to improve the performance 
of its existing system either by purchasing more hardware or exploring possible software optimization Expanding the storage capacity is a simple way of improving performance but it will also increase system cost and consume more power due to the increased number of devices A software solution while more complex and dif\223cult to implement could achieve the same level of performance without purchasing additional hardware In this paper we demonstrate our study on utilizing intelligent prefetching techniques to signi\223cantly reduce the power consumption and cost of the world\220s largest satellite images distribution system without degrading performance Before we discuss the details of the proposed prefetching algorithms it will be helpful to explain how the EROS 
satellite image distribution system works An illustration of the EROS system is shown in Figure 2 Users interact with the EROS system through the EarthExplorer and the Global Visualization Viewer web portals where the y may select one or many images for download If the requested images are available at the FTP server a download link will 978-1-4799-3214-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


Tier Model Capacity Hardware Bus Interface Tapes  200 Satellite Image Processing Subsystem New LandSAT Images  1 Sun/Oracle F5100 100 TB SSD SAS/FC 2 IBM DS3400 1 PB HDD SATA 3 Sun/Oracle T10K 10 PB Tape In\223niband Table I outlines the tiered EROS Long Term Archival Storage System as speci\223ed in a recent EROS report Since the majority of requests will be read operations using SSDs for FTP servers can signi\223cantly reduce the data transfer time once the satellite images are ready However the vast volume of EROS satellite data and the high cost of SSDs also limit the size of the FTP servers To trade-off performance and cost only a small portion of satellite data should reside in the FTP and the majority of data must be stored in the low cost tapes From this perspective the FTP can be considered as the cache layer of the EROS hybrid massive storage system There are two strategies to reduce the FTP miss rate i.e improve performance The 223rst strategy is to expand e.g doubling the FTP server size which is easy to implement with minimum system changes The second strategy is to intelligently prefetch popular images to the FTP servers before the actual requests arrive which requires a comprehensive understanding of global user behavior but can reduce cost and power consumption The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 contains a brief analysis of the EROS workload characterization Section 3 will discuss two prefetching algorithms that can be utilized to improve EROS system performance In Section 4 we present the detailed experimental results in terms of performance and power consumption by exploring various hardware and software con\223gurations available to the EROS system Section 5 provides other related work and Section 6 concludes our study II EROS W ORKLOAD C HARACTERIZATION In order to design intelligent prefetching algorithms that are capable of predicting user requests with a high degree of accuracy we must 223rst understand the critical trends exhibited by historical user requests By conducting a series of comprehensive studies using over 5 million real world requests provided by USGS we have identi\223ed several distinct characteristics of EROS workload 5 among which the following two patterns are most important Geometric Processor Fig 2 An overview of the EROS satellite images distribution system be immediately created and provided to the user This will appear as an instantaneous procedure to the user and is the ideal response time that should be sought after for every request submitted to EROS If however an image is not present in the public FTP server a new image processing workorder will be initiated To complete a workorder the raw data captured by the Landsat satellites needs to be found at magnetic tape storage 223rst then sent through a pipeline where a series of imaging processing and optimization algorithms are applied in order to produce the download-ready version This process is both CPU-intensive and IO-intensive which takes approximately 20 minutes in optimal conditions Once the 223nal version of a missing image is generated it will be placed in the FTP server and the user will be noti\223ed of its availability via email As a result a noticeable delay will be incurred if a user requested image is not currently on the FTP server Therefore improving EROS system performance can be accomplished by reducing the miss rate of FTP servers TABLE I EROS Long Term Archival Storage System While the majority of locations on Earth have a low number of requests few locations of the globe are requested with a high frequency in the same time period We also found that these 215hot spots\216 change over time Therefore the proposed prefetching algorithms should Quality  Control Format Package Image Processing Pipeline Workorder Handler Processing Queue Storage Area Network \(SAN Radiometric Processor User Interface FTP Server Database Server  User 


A small group of users is responsible for a disproportionately high volume of requests In fact the top 100 aggressive users requested almost half million images which clearly indicates that targeting on the trends of these speci\223c users would be of great bene\223t for effective prefetching III P REFETCHING T ECHNIQUES Our previous work has shown that using conventional caching algorithms LRU or LFU alone cannot reach a very high hit ratio on the FTP servers of the EROS system  Prefetching as a method of of fsetting latenc y caused by accessing low-speed storage components is a technique that has been well explored in several areas of computing 8  10 11 12 13 Unfortunately  e xisting prefetching algorithms cannot be applied directly to improve the EROS system performance because of its unique workload and user behavior In this section we propose two unique prefetching algorithms that are designed based on the EROS workload characterization results stated in Section II Fig 3 The three dimensions of an EROS satellite image focus on images of these popular areas and should be able to automatically handle evolving popularity of satellite images Images cataloged by EROS are indexed using a version of the Worldwide Reference System WRS known as WRS2 WRS-2 uses a grid that divides Landsat 5 and Landsat 7\220s orbital paths into a system of 248 latitudinal segments known as rows North-South and 233 longitudinal segments called paths\(East-West Each scene is targeted for imaging by the satellites once every orbit approximately every 16 days providing a third dimension of time as shown in Figure 3 A unique combination of row path and acquisition date is referred to as an image As Landsat 5 and 7 orbit the Earth and take new satellite images we must determine which new images should be automatically processed and prefetched into the FTP servers Although proper prefetching can reduce FTP miss rate overaggressive prefetching e.g prefetching all new satellite images would not work or even further degrade performance It has been previously observed that few of the 17,000 available locations on Earth are 215hot spots\216 Therefore it is critical to only prefetch the images that are likely to be popular and requested soon A satellite image can become popular for a variety of reasons For example an image may owe its popularity to historically signi\223cant events that occurred in the past The images that correspond to Chernobyl and Hurricane Katrina belong to this category For such 215hot spots\216 prefetching newly captured images will not be bene\223cial Instead keeping the old images in the FTP for a longer time would be more helpful For other locations users may be interested in the newest images available For example researches monitoring the effects of global warming may request the newest images of Greenland as soon as they become available In this case it would be bene\223cial to prefetch new satellite images of Greenland as soon as they are available An additional consideration is that the popularity of satellite images evolves over time For example a group of researchers may be interested in the images of the Mount Everest now for a research project but they may lose their interests after their research is complete Determining signi\223cant shift in popularity can be accomplished by splitting the trace evenly in two and identifying the most popular 100 images for both the 223rst and second half of the data An image is popular in the 223rst half but not the second half is claimed to have short term popularity Conversely if the image is popular in both the 223rst and second half of the data then the image has long term popularity Our solution to the evolving popularity issue is to update the prefetching list at the beginning of every month which ensures that the most recent popularity is re\224ected in our prefetching algorithm The previous popularity based prefetching attempts to capture trends observed by the general audience However users are likely to behave differently in terms of areas of geographical interest Therefore prefetching rules generated based on one user\220s pattern may not be suitable for another user with a different research interest With this in mind we present the second prefetching algorithm generating prefetching rules that re\224ect a user\220s historical requests The detailed user-speci\223c prefetching algorithm is explained below Every unique request for an image consists of six attributes satellite number satellite sensor row path acquisition year and acquisition day-of-year Users can vary their download pattern in any of these six dimensions between two requests which contributes dif\223culty to establishing a pattern for each user Our solution is to represent each important attribute of a request as an integer Then we concatenate all six attribute integers to create a single long integer that represents a unique satellite image Making use of an integer representation of an image where each set of digits correspond to a different attribute allows us to capture the shift in a user\220s requests by simple subtraction We can treat these movements as prefetching rules For example if a user requests two images taken by Landsat 7 200 A Prefetching based on popularity B Prefetching based on users Row Path Acquisition date 


UP represents the number of requests that a user has made We have observed in Section II that aggressive users play an important role in determining the workload of EROS system Therefore we want to pay special attention to them Our algorithm uses UP to 223lter out users who did not frequently use the EROS system Increasing UP will require a larger number of downloads by a given user before prefetching rules is applied to that user Figure 4 demonstrates the impact of increasing UP on FTP hit rate Although a larger UP will lead to lower hit rate it can signi\223cantly reduce the number of prefetched images thereby saving energy WS is a measure of the length of the system global request history that is examined when generating rules for prefetching Using WS we can ensure that we are able to utilize enough history to generate intelligent prefetches while also limiting the request history to relatively recent trends Figure 5 demonstrates how shifting window size 25 days 50 days User Popularity UP Threshold Window Size WS Threshold Con\223dence Threshold Fig 4 Impact of User Population on FTP hit rate and Landsat 5 using sensor 1 on the same location row 30 path 40 at the same time 105th day of year 2000 These two satellite requests will be represented by the integers 71-030-040-2000-105 and 5-1-030-040-2000-105 we evaluate the difference of the two and observe the following movement 710300402000105 510300402000105  200000000000000 We can use the value 200000000000000 to represent the movement of the same location on earth taken through a different satellite in this case Landast 7 and 5 We record a set of all movements made by each user as that user\220s personal pattern Even more challenging some user patterns may not come in the expected order For example if a user requests a set of images with column increment by 1 as the pattern the exact request order may show as Fig 5 Impact of Window Size on FTP hit rate Fig 6 Impact of Con\223dence Threshold on FTP hit rate and 75 days affects FTP hit rate The larger the window size more rules are likely to be generated which leads to more prefetches and higher hit rate But at the same time more energy needs to be consumed to process the prefetched images col+1 col+3 col+2  rather than col+1 col+2 col+3  To catch such irregular user patterns we generate rules by subtracting the numeric representation of each image from a vector of that user\220s history However this will result in an exponential growth in the number of rules generated To solve this problem we introduce the following three threshold values to reduce the number of derived rules   200 200 200 CT indicates the estimated likelihood that a rule will be followed by a user It is a value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of times a rule is exhibited by a user divided by the total number of rules generated by that user in the same window speci\223ed by WS Using CT we can prune rules that occur very rarely and the impact of an increasing CT value is shown in Figure 6 A higher CT means a smaller number of applied rules reduced prefetching requests and less power consumption IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed prefetching algorithms using forty-two months of real world download requests provided by EROS To accurately evaluate the proposed algorithms with respect to performance and power consumption we develop an emulator of EROS satellite image distribution system This emulator is able to emulate the EROS system with a variety of hardware and software con\223gurations which are shown in Figure 7 In each con\223guration we collect the FTP hit rates of the utilized algorithms on a monthly and overall basis in order to determine performance improvement   


A Impact on Performance 1 Prefetching Applied to Existing Con\223guration Fig 7 Summary of hardware and software con\223gurations from the current con\223guration We also evaluate the impact of different software and hardware con\223gurations on power consumption and cost of the EROS system The Least Recently Used LRU and Least Frequently Used LFU cache replacement algorithms are implemented in our emulator to determine which image to be evicted from the FTP server Additionally our emulator models a unique aspect EROS 223lls the FTP to a certain capacity threshold e.g 90 capacity before triggering a 215clean-up\216 procedure instead of replacing individual images one by one Once triggered the 215clean-up\216 procedure removes a large chunk of images according to the selected replacement policy until the FTP satis\223es a certain availability threshold e.g 45 capacity Moreover we implement the EROS 215One Week\216 policy in our emulator which prevents an image from being removed if it resides in the FTP for less than a week With the 215One Week\216 policy users are given at least a week to download their requested images In our experiments the emulator does not prefetch any images if the prefetching option is 216No\216 If the prefetching option is set as 216Yes\216 the emulator applies both popularitybased prefetching and user-based prefetching algorithms USGS has supplied a log 223le containing over 5,000,000 lines of data cross 42 months with each line representing one user request for one image to be processed and made available for download This trace 223le serves as the input of our emulator From each request the emulator extracts the ID of the user generating the request the date on which the request was made and an agglomerate variable which represents the location on the globe and the acquisition date of the image being requested While processing each request the emulator records the monthly FTP hit rates and calculates the monthly power consumption of the FTP server and Image Processing Subsystem Please refer to Figure 2 The EROS system uses a ninenode cluster to process workorders Each node is capable of processing up to four images simultaneously A new workorder either issued by FTP missing or prefetching will be inserted to the processing queue and assigned to one of the nine compute nodes in a round-robin fashion A workorder is considered to be utilizing 100 power when processing four or more images with linear power decline for a partially empty queue The EROS system FTP server farm is built with Sun F5100 224ash storage arrays Each 1920GB array consumes 386W of power when active Due to the unpredictable user behavior the nature of SSDs to provide Fig 8 Comparison of monthly hit rates for 100TB LRU caches with and without prefetching Fig 9 Average of monthly hit rates for 100TB LRU caches with and without prefetching peak performance as well as the EROS 215One Week\216 policy it is hard to dynamically turn on/off some SSDs in the FTP server to save power Therefore in our emulator all SSDs in the FTP server farm are always powered on The possible addition of 100TB in storage costs approximately 8 million The monthly po wer cost is calculated using the commercial utility rates for Sious Falls South Dakoa utility provider for EROS which at the time of study is 0.081 per kilow Currently the EROS system utilizes LRU replacement algorithm only achieving a 65.86 hit rate as shown in the summary at the end of this section in Table II We have applied the prefetching algorithms described in Section III to the standard 100TB cache used in EROS currently 2TB of disk space in the cache is reserved exclusively for images that have been processed as a prefetch request and no prefetched images will be stored on the remaining 98TB Figure 8 depicts the monthly hit rates for EROS standard 100TB LRU cache alongside the same 100TB LRU cache 


The current con\223guration of the EROS system uses LRU replacement policy to determine which images to be removed from the cache This is a simple policy as it only considers the amount of time elapsed from the last request of an image A more complex policy might yield better results As the focus of our study is on the effects of prefetching we examine the use of the LFU replacement policy in addition to prefetching with a 100TB cache Both systems will use the same 98TB/2TB split as described previously We demonstrate the monthly hit rates of the LFU and LRU policies in Figure 10 with the current con\223guration 100TB LRU without prefetching for reference We can see that the addition of prefetching still supplies an increase in hit rate over the current con\223guration but the change to LFU does result in a lower hit rate than LRU in most months On average a 100TB LFU cache with prefetching attains a 68.41 hit rate which is 1.8 lower than the results achieved with a 100TB LRU con\223guration in Figure 11 Fig 10 Comparison of monthly hit rates for 100TB LRU and LFU caches with prefetching with the addition of prefetching We observe an immediate and consistent increase in hit rate over time from the proposed prefetching algorithms A software-only change would increase average monthly hit rate by 4.43 evidenced by Figure 9 Meanwhile we observe that the system power drops in almost all cases with the proposed prefetching algorithms implemented Fig 11 Average of monthly hit rates for 100TB LRU and LFU caches with prefetching Fig 12 Comparison of monthly hit rates for 100TB and 200TB LRU caches without prefetching Fig 13 Average of monthly hit rates for 100TB and 200TB LRU caches without prefetching 2 Selecting Another Cache Replacement Algorithm 3 Expansion of Storage Capacity Up to this point we have explored the option of using intelligent prefetching to improve the performance of EROS satellite image distribution system The alternative solution for EROS is to expand the capacity of its existing hybrid storage system especially the capacity of the FTP server In this experiment we evaluate the impact of doubling the FTP server size to 200TB on performance All other con\223guration facets such as LRU replacement policy and the lack of prefetching found in the current system remains the same for this experiment 


Fig 14 Comparison of monthly hit rates for 200TB LRU caches with and without prefetching Fig 15 Average of monthly hit rates for 200TB LRU caches with and without prefetching The performance of the 200TB LRU cache deviates frequently from that of the 100TB current con\223guration with both positive and negative shifts as expressed by Figure 12 On average the monthly hit rate of a larger 200TB cache is 69.58 which is 3.71 higher than the current 100TB con\223guration as evidenced in Figure 13 As expected a larger FTP server cache size provides more storage for processed images and allows for a lower availability threshold for the LRU replacement policy Fig 16 Monthly power consumption for 100TB LRU caches with and without prefetching Fig 17 Monthly power consumption for 100TB and 200TB LRU caches without prefetching consistently outperforms the con\223guration without prefetching The monthly results are summarized in Figure 15 and we observe that the 200TB LRU cache enhanced with prefetching has an average monthly hit rate of 71.83 a marked 2.25 improvement over the 69.58 hit rate attained with a 200TB cache without prefetching As the EROS system continues to expand with more users and requests the size of the FTP server cache may be expanded out of necessity in spite of the higher associated cost Our 223nal experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the prefetching algorithms described in section III when they are applied to the 200TB LRU cache Will prefetching continue to improve the performance of EROS system with a larger cache If so how much can we offset the additional cost of 100TB of extra SSDs by using prefetching Figure 14 plots the monthly hit rates for the two cache con\223gurations of 200TB LRU with and without prefetching We can observe the con\223guration enhanced with prefetching Figure 17 plots the monthly power consumption of the 200TB LRU cache against the current con\223guration 100TB LRU and we can easily see the extra power consumed by the addition of 100TB is quite signi\223cant B Impact on Power Consumption 1 Prefetching Applied to Existing Con\223guration 4 Prefetching and Expansion of Storage Capacity 2 Expansion of Storage Capacity On a monthly basis the addition of prefetching algorithms conserves an average of 159,963 watts of power per month visible in Figure 16 As both con\223gurations utilize the same number of SSDs the differences in performance will come from the combination of overhead required to process the additional images and the same overhead not required for hits on prefetched images It appears that the penalty of additional workload caused by prefetching is much less than the bene\223t of additional hits that prefetching results in Prefetching clearly improves both the hit rate and the power consumption making it a very appealing solution 


TABLE II Summary of Average Monthly FTP Hit Rate and Monthly Power Consumption Fig 18 Monthly power consumption for 200TB LRU caches with and without prefetching 3 Prefetching and Expansion of Storage Capacity Cache Con\223guration Avg Monthly Hit Rate Avg Monthly Power Watts Avg Monthly Cost  We now examine power consumption of the same two cache con\223gurations in 223gure 18 We observe that the inclusion of prefetching results in an average monthly power consumption of 17,052,688 watts a 15.38 reduction from the 20,152,915 watt average monthly power projection of a 200TB LRU cache without prefetching In this section we provide several possible software and hardware con\223gurations that EROS may choose to improve the performance of its satellite image distribution system presented previously in Figure 7 EROS currently operates with a cache capacity of 100TB and can achieve a 3.71 increase in hit rate through the use of our proposed prefetching algorithms In addition to an increase in hit rate EROS is projected to consume 159,963 less kilowatts of power per month If the system were expanded to a cache capacity of 200TB we predict that an additional 6,244,295 watts of power would be consumed monthly at the bene\223t of 3.71 increase in monthly hit rate If EROS does expand to a larger FTP server our proposed prefetching algorithms have the potential to reduce the power consumption by 3,100,227 watts per month 15.38 Furthermore prefetching on a 200TB LRU cache would increase the hit rate by 2.25 The results of our experiments are summarized in Table II V R ELATED W ORK Massive data systems are characterized by their focus on the warehousing of vast amounts of data and the necessity to serve a multitude of clients simultaneously The current trends in research in the improvement of massive storage systems have focused on the application of solid state disks to take advantage of the myriad of technical bene\223ts they provide Lee et al has presented a thorough evaluation of the bene\223ts of using solid state drives as a cache for a larger sized hard disk array to create a tiered storage architecture in order to improve system throughput as well as to reduce power consumption Other researchers have also explored using SSDs as a faster tier of storage for caching and suggest a similar approach Schall et al have explored using SSDs in high-performance massive databases and measured power consumption under a series of differing loads and access patterns recommending that SSDs not being used as large storage devices but instead as storage for the most highly accessed pieces of data in order to take advantage of the potential power savings provided by SSDs The ER OS system utilizes a tiered hybrid storage system where raw data is stored on magnetic tapes before being requested for processing and sent to the higher layer the FTP servers made of SSDs which can take advantage of SSDs and tradeoff performance and cost when appropriate con\223gures are selected Prefetching has been widely used to increase cache performance 8 9 10 11 12 It w as reported that an effective prefetching algorithm can improve the cache hit ratio by as much as 50 percent It also has been shown that performance can be improved without a higher cost via intelligently prefetching Prefetching techniques can be classi\223ed into informed prefetching and predictive prefetching Informed prefetching relies on user-provided hints while predictive prefetching is based on the analysis results of historical user behavior For the EROS system it is almost impossible to obtain a list of a user\220s future requests before they are submitted to the system Without prior knowledge of a user\220s choices predictive prefetching will be the most appropriate method for offsetting the FTP miss penalty Next Sequential Prefetching NSP 22 23 are also used to explore spatial locality to improve cache performance However the structure of the EROS data prohibits the forming of direct spacial relationships among two images because each request can shift in six possible dimensions Please refer to Section III-B VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a variety of con\223gurations that can be applied to the FTP servers of a public-servicing massive storage system maintained by USGS EROS We have explored the changes in two key metrics performance and power consumption that can be obtained by the adoption of 100TB LRU No Prefetching current 65.8628 13,908,620 1,127 100TB LRU with Prefetching 70.2583 13,748,657 1,114 200TB LRU No Prefetching 69.5770 20,152,915 1,632 200TB LRU with Prefetching 71.8283 17,052,688 1,381 C Summary of Results 


in Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems various software and hardware con\223gurations leading us to the recommendation that prefetching algorithms be applied to any of the proposed cache con\223gurations in order to increase the hit rate and decrease the system power consumption In addition we have examined the effects of a likely future expansion of FTP server size on the EROS system and found a slight increase in hit rate in addition to the expected substantial increase in power consumption Although the bene\223t of prefetching diminishes as cache sizes become larger we continue to suggest the use of prefetching as a mechanism for offsetting the cost of powering additional hardware The cost of expanding the FTP server farm to 200TB would contain not only a signi\223cant up-front investment about 8 million dollars but an increasing power draw Our experimental results Table II demonstrate that the EROS system can maintain the same level of performance with 31.78 of power savings by using our proposed popularity-based and user-speci\223c prefetching algorithms compared to doubling the size of its FTP server farm Therefore we suggest administrators of large scale massive storage systems fully explore all possible software optimizations before physically expanding the existing system
