TAR Temporal Association Rules on Evolving Numerical Attributes Wei Wang Jiong Yang T.J. Watson Research Centers IBM ww 1 jiyang us.ibm.com Abstract Data mining has been an area of increasing interests dur ing recent years The association rule discovery problem in particular has been widely studied However there are still some unresolved problems For example research on min ing patterns in the evolution of numerical attributes is still lacking This is both a challenging problem and one with significant practical application in business science and 
medicine In this papel we present a temporal association rule model for evolving numerical attributes Metrics for qualifying a temporal association rule include the familiar measures of support and strength used in the traditional as sociation rule mining and a new metric called density The density metric not only gives us a way to extract the rules that best represent the data but also provides an effective mechanism to prune the search space An efJicient algorithm is devised for mining temporal association rules, which uti lizes all three thresholds \(especially the strength 
to prune the search space drastically Moreover the resulting rules are represented in a concise manner via rule sets to reduce the output size Experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the efJiciency of our algorithm 1 Introduction Data mining the discovery of 223interesting\224 information from a given large data set has become an active research area during recent years The association rule discovery problem has been studied for several years An associa tion rule generally has the form X Y where X and Y are two sets of items and the 
rule indicates that the oc currences of X and Y have high correlation It has been demonstrated that association rules are very useful tools for many purposes For example, supermarket managers might use association rules among products to conduct their sale promotions to achieve greater profits Earlier work on asso ciation rules  1 2 5 7 81 focused on binary attributes and intra-transaction relationships For example an association rule ham  bread would be interpreted as 223when a cus Richard Muntz 
Department of Computer Science UCLA muntz @cs.ucla.edu tomer buys ham he or she is likely to buy bread as well\224 However the information conveyed by this rule is limited This type of rule cannot describe relationships such as Supermarket If the price per item of A falls below 1 then the monthly sales of item B rise by a margin be tween loo00 and 20000 e Real estate People between 35 and 45 with salary be tween 80,000 to 
120,000 are likely to buy a house whose price range is between 300,000 and $400,000 within two years of marriage In fact mining patterns involving numerical attributes and temporal evolution has significant practical applications e.g segmenting a large customer-oriented database for market targeting and is also quite challenging Recently there have been a number of advances in this area We pro vide an overview of some recent results in the following sec tion In this paper we aim at mining temporal association rules which capture the correlation among numerical at tribute evolutions Similar to traditional association rules users are 
not required to provide a detailed road-map to guide the mining process even though temporal evolutions are in volved Parameters such as support strength e.g interest or confidence and density defined later are necessary to qualify interesting rules We assume that the database con sists of a set of objects each of which has a unique ID and a set of time varying numerical attributes For example in an employee database each person is an object and age salary height etc are attributes associated with each object A sequence of snapshots of objects 
and their attribute values are taken at some frequency Here time plays a role in syn chronizing these numerical attributes i.e each attribute is recorded at the same sequence of time instants Due to the nature of numerical attributes, many valid but uninteresting rules may exist if support and strength are the only criteria employed For example the following two rules have the same value for support and strength con fidencehnterest assuming that there is no new employee younger than 25 in the database 283 1063-6382/01$10.00 0 2001 IEEE 


1 2 Ifa new employee\222s age is between 25 and 30 then his her salary would start between 40,000 and 60,000 and increase by at least 2000 each subsequent year Ifa new employee\222s age is between 20 and 30 then his her salary would start between 40,000 and 60,000 and increase by at least 2000 each subsequent year Certainly the first rule conveys more precise information and is preferable In order to filter out the second rule we use density as an additional metric for determining whether a rule is valid For a given object the evolution of its at tributes over a period of time can be mapped to a point in a high dimensional space The distance between a pair of such points can be regarded as an indication of the dispar ity in the attribute evolution of corresponding objects If a significant number of points are 223close\224 to each other i.e a cluster is present then their corresponding object evolu tions must follow a similar pattern which in turn suggests that some correlation may exist among the evolutions of in volved attributes. A temporal association rule can be viewed as a hypercube in such a high dimensional space, which con tains the set of objects that satisfy the rule. Thus, the clusters can serve as a natural foundation for generating temporal as sociation rule Much work has been done in the area of high dimensional clustering We adopt a density-based approach 3 11 13 141 in which a cluster is defined as a region where the density is above a user-specified threshold This density threshold requirement provides the following benefits e 0 The Only hypercubes \223fully occupied\224 by a cluster of points with some minimum density are thereby identified For example c1 and c2 in Figure 1 a are reported while c3 and c4 are not qualified for generating temporal associa tion rules. Intuitively, this coincides with the notion that there should be enough samples everywhere within the intervals specified in a rule to show that the rule is valid over the entire range As a result, an interval would be included in a rule only if there are at least some mini mum number of objects whose attribute values fall into that interval For example the interval 20,25 is ex cluded from any rule as the employee\222s age since no new employee is younger than 25 Since a temporal association rule may represent the cor relation in the evolutions of any subset of attributes over a period of time it is necessary to find clusters embed ded in any subspace i.e a space consisting of a subset of dimensions of the original space The density met ric enables us to prune the search space dramatically in finding subspace clusters 3 density parameter establishes a natural connection be tween a temporal association rule and a density-based clus ter As a more restrictive model than clustering, the temporal association rule can be mined in two steps Find density-based clusters A clustering algorithm is adopted to find clusters within the mapped high dimen sional space Since a temporal association rule repre sents the correlation in the evolutions of any subset of attributes over a period of time it is necessary to find clusters embedded in a subspace We employ a bottom up subspace clustering algorithm similar to 3 to find all clusters with some minimum density and support Rule generation For each identified cluster we gen erate rules which have enough support and strength Both the well-known Apriori property \(with respect to the support metric\and a novel based on the strength metric are used in prune the search during the rule generation process             mi g j 0  1    i           I I salary a clusters in domain space  rmin 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 salary raise in thousand dollars b inin-rules and max-rules Figure 1 Example of Employee Database It is well known that the number of valid rules is often large in association rule mining applications and without ad ditional filtering, would be even much larger in our proposed temporal association rule problem To address this problem we use a compact representation of the collection of all valid rules, namely rule sets Each rule set is represented by a pair of rules one called the min-rule is ra specialization of the other called the max-rule A valid rille set is a min-rule max-rule pair such that any rule which is a specialization of the max-rule and a generalization of the min-rule is also valid For example, suppose the light shaded region in Fig ure 1 b\represents the attribute values which satisfy the sup port strength confidencehnterest\and density requirement Any subregion of the light shaded region which contains the dark shaded area, also satisfies the requirements e.g T in Figure l\(b is an example of such region There could be potentially many such subregions Thus we use min-rule and max-rule boxes as shown in Figure l\(b to represent these subregions The formal definition of rule sets is pre sented in Section 3 This representation of large sets of rules by a min-rule max-rule pair is both notationally efficient and also leads to algorithmic efficiencies by defining opera tions on rule sets 284 


Contribution of the paper In this paper we propose a temporal association rule model to represent the correla tion among numerical attribute evolutions. Besides the com monly used metrics such as support and strength an addi tional metric density is introduced to qualify valid temporal association rules. A novel approach is proposed to mine tem poral association rules by first discovering subspace clusters followed by efficiently constructing rules via special prop erties held by the support and strength metrics Empirical evaluation shows that this approach outperforms alternative algorithms by a large margin in terms of execution time Last but not least the result is represented in a concise manner via rule sets The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Sec tion 2 presents some related work The general model is presented in Section 3 Section 4 describes our approach to mining temporal association rules with numerical attributes in detail. Performance analysis is presented in Section 5 Fi nally conclusions are drawn in Section 6 2 Related Work The model of quantitative association rules is introduced in 191 The domain of each quantitative attribute is divided into a set of intervals and intervals are combined as long as their support is less than the user-specified max-support The original intervals and the combined intervals are treated as a set of items The algorithms for mining traditional associa tion rules can be applied to these items Unfortunately, the Max-support threshold may exclude some strong and inter esting rules from being discovered In order to overcome this problem in our model we will use a more meaningful metric, namely densify to restrict the search space 6 presented a geometric-based algorithm BitOp for performing clustering on association rules of the form A n B C where the left hand side attributes A and B are quantitative and the right hand side attribute C is categori cal Given a rule format A n B  c the attribute domain is partitioned into two dimensional grids For each specific value of C data in each individual grid cell is examined to determine whether the association rule applies for that grid cell and the result is represented by a bit in a two dimensional bitmap Then a clustered association rule can be formed by combining a set of association rules with identical right hand side but 223adjacent\224 left hand side attribute values A smooth ing technique is employed to cover 223small holes\224 within a big cluster The result is an approximation to the result a human might construct None of the above work addressed the temporal aspect of association rules The authors of  161 consider the subject of mining co-evolving time sequences online A method namely MUSCLES is proposed to use a multi-variate lin ear regression model based on the portions of given time sequences within a tracking window to detect correlations outliers and to predict missing data lo proposed a scheme called FITI to mine inter transaction association rules on categorical attributes This algorithm was inspired by the observation that an inter transaction frequent itemset contains only the frequent item sets of its corresponding intra-transaction counterpart A special data structure containing intra-transaction frequent itemsets is used to provide fast mining of inter-transaction frequent itemsets We also notice that many research has been conducted in the areas of mining 223optimized association rules\224 mining association rules with constraints, mining sequential patterns in time series data, discovering periodic patterns, and simi larity search in time sequence\(s Interested readers please refer to  131 for a detailed overview Alternative solutions to our problem Inspired by 9 and 6 the following are two alternative so lutions to our problem SR algorithm One method is to map the numerical attribute evolutions to binary attributes and apply one of the existing algorithms for mining association rules 9 For each nu merical attribute A its domain is quantized to b intervals O\(b2 items i.e binary attributes are needed to represent all possible subranges for each attribute Therefore if the data consists oft snapshots O\(b2 x t items are required to encode all possible evolutions of an attribute range After the transformation a traditional data mining algorithm can be used to mine the rules Finally the rules in terms of the binary attribute values can be mapped back to the numerical ranges However, this creates a huge number of items and hence makes the mining process very inefficient LE algorithm In this method after domain quantization rules are first generated for each possible right hand side at tribute and each possible value of this attribute Then final rules are formed by combining 223adjacent\224 association rules with identical right hand sides 6 This is due to the fact that the original algorithm was designed for categorical right hand side attribute Therefore in order to solve the problem presented in this paper, each possible evolution of the right hand side attribute has to be mapped into a distinct \(categori cal\value After generating the rules, the combining process has to be performed separately for each possible rule format and each possible evolution of the right hand side attribute For example for each right hand side attribute A if its do main is partitioned into b intervals and we consider its evo lution over t snapshots then there could be b2t distinct evo lutions This approach becomes inefficient in the context we address as the number of possible attribute evolutions which can serve as the right hand side attribute of the rule explodes exponentially with the total number of attributes andor length of attribute evolution time series In contrast our proposed algorithm handles attributes on the right hand 285 


side of the rule in a similar manner as the attributes on the left hand side Thus the necessity of transforming the right hand side into categorical values can be avoided This char acteristic of our algorithm leads to a significant performance advantage over the previous approach This observation is verified by the performance results in Section 5 3 General Model In this paper we deal with objects Each object has a unique ID and a set of numerical attributes AI A2   The database is viewed as a sequence of snapshots SI S2    St of objects and their attribute values taken at some fre quency We aim at finding correlations among evolu tions of attributes In contrast to the traditional associ ation rule discovery the building blocks in our proposed temporal association rules are attribute evolutions Intu itively an evolution describes the temporal changes of at tribute values of some object For example 223employee\222s salary changes from an interval of 40,000 and 45,000 to an interval of 47,500 and 55,000 then to an inter val of 60,000 and 70,000\224 is an evolution This evolu tion of attribute salary involves 3 snapshots and can be represented as salary E 40000,45000  salary E 47500,55000  salary E SOOOO 700001 2233\224 is re ferred to as the length of the evolution. Formally given an at tribute A and m snapshots an evolution E\(Ai of length m describes the range of values of Ai at each snapshot, which is represented as Ai E l1,~1  Ai E l2,~2      Ai E I U where Zj uj is the range of val ues of Ai at the jth snapshot Conceptually an m dimen sional space can be constructed by associating the jth di mension to the value of Ai at the jth snapshot relative to the start of the evolution This space is referred to as the evolu tion space of Ai for evolutions of length m Any evolution of Ai of length m uniquely corresponds to an m dimen sional hypercube refehed to as evolution cube in the evolu tion space, and vice versa For example, Figure 2 shows the evolution space for evolutions on salary of length 3 The evolution E1  salary E 40000,45000  salary E 47500,55000  salary E SOOOO 700001 corresponds to the shaded cube For any two evolutions E\(Ai  Ai E ll  Ai E l2,~2    Ai E l and E\222\(Ai  of the same length m Ai is a specialization of E\222\(Ai iff for every j\(1 5 j 5 m Zj,uj is enclosed by l U In other words, the evolution cube corresponding to E\(Ai in the evolution space\is entirely subsumed by the evolu tion cube corresponding to E\222\(Ai In such a case E\222 is a generalization of E\(Ai For example E1 is a spe cialization of salary E 40000,55000  salary E 40000,60000  salary E SOOOO 700001 However it is not a specialization of salary E 40000,55000  Ai E l U  Ai E lh U    Ai E A,u cube of E snapshot 3 Figure 2 Evolution Space for salary salary E 40000 50000  salargr E SOOOO 65000 Note that an evolution is always a specialization and a gen eralization of itself This specializatiordgeneralization rela tionship forms a lattice among evolutions Multiple attribute evolutions Evolutions can span any set of snapshots In this pa per we focus on mining correlations of simultaneous evo lutions \(of different attributes i.e evolutions over the same set of snapshots In general if n attributes AI A2     A are considered then the evolution space for the conjunc tion of evolutions E\(A1 E\(A2   E\(A of length m is an n x m space where each dimension represents the val conjunctions EC  E\(Al n E\(A2 n   n E\(A and EC\222  E\221\(A1 n E\221\(A2 n   n E\221 EC is a special ization of EC\222 iff for every attribute Ai 1  j  n E\(Ai is a specialization of E\221\(Ai In this case EC\222 is also called a generalization of EC ues of one attribute at one snapshot For any two evolution 3.1 Temporal Association Rules Our proposed temporal association rule has the form of X Y where X and Y are conjunctions of attribute evolutions We use U instead of since correlation is indeed a symmetric relationship In this paper we as sume that Y only contains the evolutioin of one attribute for simplicity and clarity of exposition All results with minor modifications can be applied to the case where evolution conjunctions are allowed for Y as well as X Definition 3.1 Let Al  A2    A be U subset of attributes A temporal association rule of length m is a correlation E\(A e E\(Ak and E\(Ai is an evolution of length m of attribute A 1 5 i 5 n E\(A n E\(A n  n E\(A n E\(A n  n 286

Criteria for assess ing interest in a rule are elaborated in the following discus sions For any rule, its support, density and strength are indi cations of frequency of occurrence, concentration of popula tion and the degree of non-independency represented by this rule respectively The reasons for specifying support and strength thresholds are similar to the reasons for specifying support and confidence thresholds in traditional association rule discovery  1,2 In addition due to the nature of numer ical data, users need to specify one more parameter densify Intuitively this is motivated by the notion that clustering may provide an efficient means to segment objects naturally ac cording to their behavior and on the other hand there should be enough samples everywhere within the intervals specified in a rule to show that the rule is valid over the entire range Thus the density parameter 6 is introduced for this purpose The length of a rule is usually smaller than the number of snapshots available The concepts of window and object history are then introduced to facilitate the mining of rules of any length A window of width m is a sub of m consecutive snapshots Sj Sj+l   Sjfm-1 where 1 5 j 5 t  m  1 and Sj is called the starting snap shot This window is denoted by W\(j,m For exam ple S3 Sq Sg s6 and Sg  S7 s SS are two windows of width 4 and 5 and are denoted by W\(3,4 and W\(5,5 respectively In general given a sequence of t snapshots SI    St there are a total oft  m 1 different windows of width m where 1 5 m 5 t Given an object o and a window W\(j,m  Sj Sj+l    Sj+m-l the sequence of tempo ral changes of o over W\(j m is called the object history of o within window W\(j m The length of this object his tory is m An object history can be mapped to a point in the corresponding evolution space of the involved attributes A temporal association rule can be viewed as a hypercube in this high dimensional space which contains the set of ob ject histories satisfying the rule The thresholds for support strength, and density correspond to constraints on the num ber and distribution of object histories within the hypercube These thresholds will be discussed in more detail shortly Given a sequence of m snapshots and an evolution on attribute Ai of length m we say that an object history of length m within a window W\(j,m  Sj Sj+l   Sj+,,,-l follows this evolution i.e E\(Ai iff for each snapshot in the window the value of the at tribute in the object history falls into the corresponding in terval specified in E\(Ai In other words if the point repre senting the object history in the evolution space is enclosed by the box representing the given evolution then we say that the object history follows this evolution For example if the salary of an object history of \223Joe Smith\224 changes from 44000 to 50000 then to 62000 then we say that this object history of \223Joe Smith\224 follows evolution E1 defined in the previous example However, such an object history does not follow the evolution salary E 40000,50000  salary E 55000,57500  salary E SOOOO 675001 since 50000 does not belong to the range 55000,57500 An object history is said to follow an evolution conjunction E\(A1 nE\(A2 n  nE\(A iff this object history follows every evolution E\(A 1 5 i 5 n As mentioned before clusters are generated as a first step in constructing temporal association rules In this paper we employ an efficient clustering algorithm based on space partitions similar to 3 113 The space is discretized into small base cubes and a cluster is thereby approximated by a set of adjacent base cubes which meet some density thresh old Each attribute domain is quantized into a set of disjoint equal-length intervals, referred as base intervals and a cer tain amount of information loss is introduced For simplicity of exposition in this paper we assume that the same number of base intervals are used for every attribute domain This can be easily generalized to different numbers of base inter vals on different attribute domains Let b be the number of base intervals for each attribute domain The values within each base interval are regarded as non-distinguishable As a result, the evolution space consists of b\224 basic hypercubes referred to as base cubes Each evolution cube is then rep resented as the union of a set of adjacent base cubes For example the evolution cube of E1 in Figure 2 consists of 24 base cubes The span of a base cube in each dimension in this example is 2,500 For a given evolution E\(Ai object histories of different objects might follow E\(Ai during different windows For example E\(Ai may be followed by an object history of object 01 at window W\(j m and an object history of object 02 at window W\(k m where j  k Therefore we define support, strength, and density based on object histories For 287 


an evolution of length m a sliding window of width m is used to examine object histories of length m For example in order to evaluate evolutions of length 3 all object histories of length 3 are considered as illustrated in Figure 3 All object histories within all windows of length 3 are examined to aggregate the overall support strength, and density We now discuss each of these three measures in detail  s4 ss s6   snapshot 00000000  U U U sliding window of width 3 ___ Figure 3 Sliding Window 3.1.1 Support The support of an evolution conjunction E\(A1 n E\(A2 n  n E\(A of length m on a sequence of snapshots SI S2    St is the number of object histories of length m which follow this evolution conjunction For a given window W\(j,m the support within this window is the number of object histories which follow the evolution con junction The overall support of this evolution conjunction is the sum of the supports within each window There fore one object can contribute multiple times to the sup port if multiple object histories of this object follow the evo lution conjunction The support of a temporal association rule E\(Al n E\(A2 n   n E\(Ak-l n E\(Ak+l n    n E\(An U E\(Ak over snapshots SI S2   St is the support of E\(Al n E\(A2 n    n E\(A,-l n E\(A on the same sequence of snapshots Definition 3.2 Given an evolution conjunction n  E\(A1 n E\(A2 n    n E\(A of length m and a sequence of snapshots R  SI S2     St the support of the evolution conjunction denoted by Suppmt\(ll R is where N\(II,W\(j,m is the number of object histories whichfollow II on window W\(j m 3.1.2 Strength Different methods can be used to capture the degree of non independence In this paper we use a metric that is similar to interest defined in 4 to measure the strength of a temporal association rule Definition3.3 Given a temporal association rule R  X w Y and a sequence of snapshols R  SI SZ     St suppori xny,n the strength of the rule is Support\(X,n Y,n 3.1.3 Density Since we are concerned with numerical attributes, there can be unoccupied regions in the evolution space especially when the attribute domain is continuous The density con cept is introduced to enable a cluster oriented approach and to ensure that a region in the evolution space will not be in cluded as part of a rule if there is no enough evidence to show that the rule holds for the region More specifically a valid rule corresponds to an evolution cube in which object history concentration within each base cube contained in the evolu tion cube is above the specified density threshold Thus we introduce the density parameter to capture the object history concentration of the sparsest base cube within the evolution cube Different base cubes will in general contain different number of object histories.

3.2 Rule Sets Definition 3.5 Given two rules i and rma5 where i is a specialization of I a rule set  i T  rep resents the set of all rules I such that I is a specialization of T and a generalization of i i and I are called min-rule and max-rule of the rule set respectively Looking ahead, the number of valid rules can be very large but we will often be able to use a small number of rule sets to summarize all valid rules 4 Our Approach Given a sequence of snapshots our objective is to find the set of temporal association rules that meet the user specified thresholds for support density and strength This problem can be transformed into a problem of identifying clusters in a high dimensional space Two phases involved are involved in finding the temporal association rules 1 After partitioning each attribute domain into b base in tervals find all subspace\clusters with respect to the density threshold 2 Based on identified clusters find all valid rule sets 4.1 Cluster Discovery We first find all dense base cubes in a bottom-up fashion and then generate clusters by coalescing adjacent dense base cubes 3 141 The Apriori property holds on the density met ric 3 141 and can be restated into the following properties that are directly used in pruning the evolution space Property4.1 Let E  Ai E Z1,u1  Ai E Z2,u2  Zj+l uj+1      Ai E Zk,uk be two evolutions where 1 _ j 5 IC 5 m For a given sequence of snapshots R the density of E over R is less than or equal to that of E In the above property E contains a subsequence of inter vals specified in E E can be viewed as a projection of E onto an evolution space of lower dimensionality Property 4.2 Given a sequence of snapshots R the density of an evolution conjunction E\(A1 n E\(A2 n    n E\(An is less than or equal to the density of the conjunction of any    Ai E Z,,U and E  Ai E lj,~j  Ai E subsetof{E\(AI E\(A2    E\(An Similar to Property 4.1 Property 4.2 states that the den sity of an evolution conjunction is less than or equal to the density of any of its projections onto an evolution space of lower dimensionality Based on these two prop erties a level-wise dynamic programming 7 algorithm can be used to find all dense base cubes In Figure 4 BaseCube\(i m denotes the set of base cubes of evolution conjunctions involving i distinct attributes and having length m If the density of a base cube bc in BaseCube\(i m sat isfies the density threshold then by Property 4.1 both of bc's projections in BaseCube\(i m  1 have to satisfy the threshold as well In addition by Property 4.2 all bc's pro jections in BaseCube\(i  1 m must also satisfy the density threshold Level n+t-1 Cup 0    Property 3.1  Property 3.2 Level n+t-2  ky 1 ByCuv.n 1-1   Level 1 B&Che\(l 1 Figure 4 Base Cube Lattice Therefore, beginning from the set of all base intervals, at each successive level j we compute the set of dense base cubes in BaseCube\(i,j  i  1 for all 1 5 i 5 j until such a level that the set of dense base cubes at the previous level is empty The set BaseCube\(i m is examined during the i  m  1 scan of the data Let 0 be the maximum value of i  m  1 for all dense base cubes where i and m are the number of involved attributes and the evolution length of a base cube respectively Then the algorithm makes 0 passes over the database Let y  i x m be the highest dimensionality of any dense base cube2 Then the algorithm is exponential with respect to y since all of its projections of this dense base cube onto a subset of these y dimensions are also dense It follows that the computational complexity of this step is O\(Bx I R I cy for a small constant c where 1 R I is the data size After we find all dense base cubes a set of clusters can be formed by linking adjacent base cubes This step is equiva lent to finding connected component in a graph Each dense base cube is mapped to a graph vertex and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding dense base cubes are adjacent i.e they share a common face A depth-first traversal through this graph would be able to find all clusters In fact any algorithm proposed for efficiently comput ing subspace clusters can be adopted in this phase We will not elaborate on them in this paper due to space limitations Since every valid rule has to satisfy the density requirement 2Note that y  0 in general 289 


we only need to explore these clusters in the second phase In addition we will not examine a cluster if its support is less than the user specified threshold because no rule de rived from this cluster can meet the required support 4.2 Temporal Association Rule Discovery Let SUPPORT STRENGTH and E be the user spec ified thresholds for support strength and density respec tively The properties of strength will be shown to enable us to find all temporal association rules efficiently Let AI Az    A be a subset of attributes The space of evo lution conjunctions E\(A1 n E\(A2 n  n E\(A of length m is an m x n dimensional space Our objective is to find all valid rule sets E\(A1 n E A2 n   n E Ak 1 n E\(Ak+l  n    n E\(A U E\(Ak for each possible choice for the right hand side attribute Ak Note that in contrast to the previous algorithm proposed in 6 our approach treats the attribute on the right hand side of a rule in a similar man ner to the handling of left hand side attributes As a result it avoids the necessity of examining the left hand side at tributes repeatedly for each possible value of the right hand side A significant performance advantage over the previous approach is then achieved as demonstrated in Section 5 It is obvious that given an attribute Ak as the right hand side, only one rule corresponds to each evolution cube whose strength can be calculated uniquely In the following discussion, without loss of generality, we assume that Ak is on the right hand side of the rule and rule\(c and cube\(r are used to denote the corresponding rule of evolution cube c and the corresponding evolution cube of rule r respectively As we mentioned before due to the density requirement, we only need to examine rules whose corresponding evaluation cubes are enclosed entirely by some cluster The finest gran ularity rule we consider is the rule that corresponds to only one dense base cube We regard such rules as base rules The following two properties \(which are proven in  131 are used to guide the rule discovery process in each cluster The final result is the union of all valid rule sets discovered in each cluster Property4.3 For any rule r there exists a base rule brj which is a specialization of r and whose strength is at least that of T This property is illustrated in Figure 5\(a Basically it says that any valid rule has to be a generalization of some base rule whose strength is at least STRENGTH Then for this cluster, we only need to examine rules which are gen eralizations of the set of base rule\(s BR whose strengths are at least STRENGTH Let R be this set of rules, each of which is a generalization of some subset of base rule in BR and whose corresponding evolution cube is enclosed by the given cluster R contains all potential valid rules which can be discovered from this cluster The following property can be utilized to prune R further r h5 a Property 4.3 b Property 4.4 Figure 5 Properties for Strength Property 4.4 For any two rules r and r\222 where r\222 is a spe cialization of I and the strength of r\222 i,s less than that of r there exists another base rule bri which is a specialization of r but not r\221 and whose strength is greater than that of r As illustrated in Figure 5\(b this property implies that if the strength of a rule r\222 is below the threshold STRENGTH then the strength of any generalization of TI denoted by r is below STRENGTH unless r con tains some other base rule bri whose strength is greater than STRENGTH This suggests that we can prune R further by skipping those rules which are generalizations of r\222 but which do not contain any other base ruk in BR Since each rule in R is a generalization of some base rule\(s in BR for any two rules r E R and bri E BR we say that r contains br iff the evolution cube of bri is enclosed by that of r Rules in R can be divided into groups such that rules in the same group contain the same subset of base rules in BR If there are g base rules in BR then there are 29  1 distinct subsets of BR and hence R consists of 29  1 groups one for each subset Moreover the set of evolu tion cubes corresponding to rules in the same group occupy a continuous region in the search space. For example in Fig ure 6 BR   bl  b2    bg  are the set of base rules whose strengths are above the threshold BR\222  b3 b4 is a sub set of BR The light shaded area between those two solid contours in Figure 6 corresponds to the region for the set of evolution cubes, denoted by SE which are generaliza tions of b3 and bq but not others in BR SEC stands for Set of Evolution Cubes Any evolution cube that contains the inner contour and is enclosed by the outer contour belongs to SEC34 All rules whose corresponding evolution cubes are in SEC34 belong to the same group Therefore each cluster can be viewecl as the union of a set of regions each of which contains the set of evolution cubes corresponding to rules belonging to the same group In our algorithm each such region is examined in turn so that the space can be pruned efficiently 290

at a slower pace with respect to the number of base inter vals When we choose the number of base intervals to be 100 in the TAR algorithm, the response time is still within an acceptable length but 90 recall can be achieved One of the reasons that TAR has a significant better per formance is that the strength threshold is merely used to verify whether a rule is valid in the SR and LE algorithms whereas the strength is used to prune the search space in the TAR algorithm In turn, the set of candidate rules searched by the TAR algorithm is much smaller than others and hence the response time is improved Figure 7\(b shows the re sponse time of the three algorithms as a function of the strength In this test, the support and density thresholds are set to 5 and 2 respectively and there are 100 base inter vals on each domain The response time of the SR and LE remain constant because they do not use strength as a tool to prune the search space. However in the TAR algorithm the strength threshold is utilized to prune the search space, thus the performance is improved 5.2 Real Data Set We also ran the TAR algorithm on a real data set Each object represents a person The attributes are the age, the title of that person, the salary of that person family status sin gle, married, head of household and the distance between the person\222s house and a major city The distance is com puted based on the zip codes We selected all attributes as interesting There are 20,000 objects and 10 snapshots The snapshot was taken once a year from 1986 to 1995 We set the number of base intervals to be 100 and the thresholds for support density, and strength to be 3 i.e 600 objects 2 and 1.3 respectively It took approximately 260 seconds to mine the rules A total of 347 rule sets were discovered Due to space limita tion we only can present a few of mined rules here One rule discovered is that 223People receiving a raises tend to move further away from the city center.\224 This rule might be ex plained by the price of a house in the suburbs being more expensive and the area being more desirable to high income family The other is that 223People with a salary in the range between 70,000 to lOO,OOO get a raise the range of the raise will likely be from $7,000 to 15,000.\224 6 Conclusions In this paper we studied the problem of discovering cor relations among temporal evolutions numerical attributes The temporal association rules are introduced to describe this type of relationships Three parameters support strength and density are employed to qualify the validity of a rule We also devise an algorithm that can efficiently find the set of rules based on user specified thresholds In particular, sub space clustering is employed and some special properties on strength metric are proven and utilized to prune the search space further.

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
