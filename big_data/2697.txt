A Stream Partitioning Approach to Processing Large Scale Distributed Graph Datasets Rui Wang Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Binghamton Email rwang4@cs.binghamton.edu Kenneth Chiu Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Binghamton Email kchiu@cs.binghamton.edu Abstract RDF datasets are an important source of big data Many of them however are too large to t on a single machine One approach to address this is to partition the RDF graph across multiple machines with each component residing on a single machine A poor partition can incur signiìcant communication costs however if as a result many queries involve multiple machines A number of existing partitioning schemes seek to reduce these costs by nding partitions that avoid cutting edges in the RDF graph While these can successfully nd good partitions the partitioning process itself is often not very scalable and not capable of handling incrementally-generated RDF data In this paper we develop a more scalable effective and low complexity approach online graph dataset partitioning to produce high quality dataset partitions with fewer links between partitions We show experimentally that it works well in reducing the communication cost of query processing while at the same time improving scalability of the partitioning itself Index Terms communication cost dataset partitioning online algorithm graph partitioning large scale RDF dataset I I NTRODUCTION Resource Description Framework RDF datasets are a signiìcant source of big data For example the open data movement initiated by the W3C publishes data in RDF format on the Web By 2011 the Linked Open Data LOD project had published 295 datasets consisting of over 31 billion RDF triples interlinked by around 504 million RDF links To query manage and store these datasets one option is to store each RDF triple as a row in a table and use a relational database This incurs substantial overhead for join operations however which are required when following edges When extensive joins are required the relational DB model breaks down However in a database where the RDF graph is explicitly modeled as a graph graph DB the join operation is easy to perform because the edges between graph elements make the relationships within the data explicit The beneìt of the graph DB model is that traversing is very efìcient and it yields a style of problem-solving known as the graph traversal pattern Graph DB techniques have been widely used in different types of applications such as social biological transportation and language The size of these datasets however may preclude storing and processing one of them on a single machine As a result a number of distributed graph DB approaches have been developed including Microsoftês Trinity Google s Pregel and F acebook s T ao 4 T ypically  these systems store the data as a graph and then hash some aspect of the data and use the resulting hash code to partition the RDF graph across nodes of a computer cluster The hashing approach is easy to implement and is efìcient for simple data retrieval However it is oblivious to any structure in the data and in fact intentionally destroys any clustering Because the hashing approach strives to distribute data evenly without considering the relationships between data it often results in a large number of edge cuts Thus related data is separated over several machines and with complex data needs involving joins this incurs heavy communication costs for query messages and the transferring of intermediate results This weakens the processing capacity of graph database systems Intelligent partitioning thus is key to controlling communication costs for querying and evenly distributing the graph partitions In order to efìciently manage a large scale dataset in a distributed system an approach superior to hash partitioning is needed In our previous research we proposed a graph partitioning approach to manage large scale RDF datasets This approach minimizes the number of RDF links between triples on different data nodes Graph partitioning thus reduces both the number of query messages across nodes and the total number of bytes that must be transferred A system design taking advantage of the characteristics of the partitions that have been produced further reduces system overhead Through experiments the results showed that graph partitioning is a promising approach to generate good partitions for distributed data processing and dataset management Although graph partitioning is a promising method most existing graph partitioning algorithms are ofîine algorithms or ofîine approximation algorithms such as Metis F o r big data problems loading the whole graph into memory and using traditional graph algorithms to process is not feasible A scalable and effective way to approximate the behavior of graph partitioning and to get comparable performance is the key to widespread real-world adoption of graph partitioning In this paper we propose an online graph partitioning approach to distributing RDF resource and triples In RDF resource partitioning vertices RDF resources are assigned to graph components on-the-îy as triples stream in In the triple allocation triples are assigned based on different supervised strategies for better performance There are two aspects of our research contribution First we adopt the streaming data model which is crucial for many real-world scenarios Second online algorithms were created to approximate graph partitioning goals which generate partitions of roughly the same size with minimum edge cut To evaluate our work we used real world datasets such as Uniprot dataset Link edCT dataset 8 and Semantic Dog Food dataset Also we b uilt a simulation system to carry out experiments It partitions datasets according to our algorithms simulating querying with benchmark queries and accumulates statistics on the load balance of each partition and system communication cost In the experiment we 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 537 


compare the results between our online hashing and ofîine approaches As shown by our experimental results our proposed online partitioning approach consistently outperformed hash partitioning on all the testing datasets for evaluation of communication cost the size balance of partitions is also better We note that in addition to communication costs graph processing also involves computational and local I/O costs Controlling communication costs however is crucial to any overall solution and is the focus of this paper Furthermore though a simulation we believe that our system accurately measures the communication costs of a distributed graph processing system for RDF data and actually is more exible than a working graph processing system for investigating different strategies We also note that our approach can work on other types of dataset as well such as the property graph model and the relational database model as long as there is some way to represent data relationships during processing as a graph Section II introduces background knowledge Section III details our online graph partitioning approach to RDF dataset Experiments in section IV presents evaluation and comparison with hashing approach in partitioning Section V discusses related works Finally section VI sums up the paper and discusses future work II B ACKGROUND A RDF RDF Resource Description Framework is a W3C speciìcation for modeling graph-structured data Though originally intended primarily for metadata its use has expanded to include many forms of graph-structured data An RDF statement also called a RDF triple is denoted as  Subject  Predicate  Object  The Subject and Predicate are URIs while the Object can be a URI or literal The URI is also called a resource The Subject or Object also can be blank nodes which serves to aggregate other Objects or Subjects We consider blank nodes to be the same as resources for the purposes of this paper The graph model for a RDF triple is that Subject and Object are represented as vertices and the Predicate is denoted as a labeled edge directed from the Subject vertex to the Object vertex This model is similar to property graph model used by Neo4J Therefore a RDF dataset can be represented by a graph The formal deìnition of this graph can be found in Fig 2 sho ws a RDF graph of the dataset in Fig 1 sampled from the Semantic Web Dog Food Dataset The dataset is simpliìed from the original data for clarity B SPARQL and Query Processing SPARQL is a RDF query language and allows for queries consisting of triple patterns conjunctions disjunctions and an optional pattern These are able to retrie v e and manipulate data stored in RDF format in a database This paper mainly uses triple patterns for benchmark queries A triple pattern is similar to an RDF triple but allows any of the subject predicate and object elds to be a variable Note that SPARQL triple patterns are also graph patterns When querying the graph pattern of the query is matched to subgraphs of the RDF dataset  Snippet of çiswc 2010 nt  Google-inc-germany-gmbh type Organization  Google-inc-germany-gmbh based_near gmbh/location  Google-inc-germany-gmbh member Thomas  Thomas type Person  Thomas homepage author39477.html  Thomas affiliation Google-inc-germany-gmbh  Thomas status industry  Thomas publish_on ISWC2010 Thomas based_near Germany Roger based_near Germany Sabine based_near Germany Sebastian based_near Germany Ulf based_near Germany Stefan based_near Germany Ulrich based_near Germany Fig 1 Example RDF dataset type google-inc-germany-gmbh Organization gmbh/location based_near  Thomas  member affiliation author39477.html homepage ISWC2010 publish_on Person type Status Industry based_near Germany Sabine Stefan Ulrich Roger Sebastian Ulf based_near based_near based_near based_near based_near based_near Fig 2 RDF graph and graph partition In this paper we use SPARQL queries as benchmark queries for evaluating the performance of our approach A query example in Fig 3 shows how it can be converted to a graph pattern This query asks for the person who is the member of Google GMBH and works in Germany For query processing existing distributed RDF stores such as ha v e tw o kinds of machine nodes a coordinator which receives and replies to queries and data nodes which provides results for queries to the coordinator The coordinator records the status of the sent-out queries Since the query coordinator is involved in many phases of query processing it can become Query Select person Where  google-inc-germany-gmbh member person  person based_near Germany   person  google-inc-germany-gmbh Germany member based_near Fig 3 Example Query 538 


a signiìcant bottleneck of the system Also how many queries the coordinator can process at a time will directly determine how many users can access the system which inîuences the parallelism In order to compare with our new design we call the system introduced here a conventional system  When a complex query is processed in a conventional system rst it is divided into several sub-queries which are sent to the data nodes The data nodes to send to are determined by some type of look up in various indices Some queries require multiple rounds to execute For example queries following the pattern  s  p 1   x   x  p 2   y  need to receive answers for  x from the rst part before the second part can begin A query such as  s  p 1   x   x  p 2 o   however can be answered in one round We call a query that requires one round to be a 1-level query a query that requires 2-rounds to be a 2-level query etc For 1-level queries the coordinator needs to merge the intermediate results and often the transfer cost is higher than ideal because the returned intermediate results include data that does not make it to the nal result For 2-level queries the coordinator is often waiting for intermediate results from part of sub-queries This waiting time limits the throughput of the coordinator III O NLINE P ARTITIONING OF RDF D ATASETS Before detailing the online algorithms for RDF dataset partitioning weêd like to formally introduce the data processing model we used in this paper and introduce the concepts of the online algorithm we chose for partitioning A Data Stream Model and Online Algorithm The data stream model is well known in the telecommunication eld It describes a sequence of data packets used to send or receive information that are in the process of being transmitted In this paper we use data stream model for processing sets of RDF triples Because when reading in the large triple dataset the triples are read in one by one in a long time span and are processed on the y The inputs are not available for random access on disk or in memory This behavior meets the deìnition of data stream model Formal deìnition of triple stream model is ordered sequences of pairs each pair being made of a RDF triple and a time stamp t can be denoted   sub i pred i obj i  t i   Time stamps can be regarded as annotations of RDF triples and monotonically non-decreasing in the stream Consecutive triples can have the same time stamp meaning that they stream in the buffer at the same time and are processed in the same batch In our stream model the triple is initially stored in a buffer with a certain window size All triples in the buffer will be processed together once The range of window size is limited by available memory In contrast to our previous work using an ofîine algorithm we used an online algorithm in this paper An online algorithm processes its input incrementally as it is available without having the entire input available from the start Such algorithms are appropriate where the input may be too large to store in memory as a whole and also limit the processing time per item Those constraints mean that an online algorithm produces an approximate answer based on a summary or sketch of the data stream in memory Our algorithmês focus on the amount of memory usage allows it to be called a streaming algorithm For stream orders in this paper we choose to solve orderfree case because we think in real life application the order of data is mostly undecidable Hence designing the stream algorithm according to special order information would limit the usability of the algorithm Although we treat the problem as order-free our partitioning algorithm can still use the order information if it exist In addition we provide several allocation strategies as conìguration options which can optimize the performance according to order characteristic of different dataset B Vertex Partitioning The goal of this algorithm is to make a preliminary assignment of a vertex subject or object resource to a partition 1 Before Partitioning To partition the vertices rst we choose window size for the stream-in buffer and make it as large as possible if system resources are available A larger stream-in buffer will produce better partitions that have fewer total edge cuts When the dataset is read in triples are initially stored in the stream-in buffer The data remains there until the buffer is full For each vertex a partial adjacency list is built based on the triples in the buffer The vertices are sorted in descending order according to the number of edges among the vertices in the buffer This is to handle the most connected vertex so far rst because this kind of vertex is more helpful in forming a locally highly connected sub-graph When such a vertex is assigned to a partition it will tend to attract other vertices to its partition during the vertex partitioning which improves the quality of the partitioning Also this adjacency list can be built on the y and because the buffer size is small this step will not be time consuming After this all the information needed for stream partitioning is prepared The two steps described above will be repeated for each buffer-full of streaming triples until the whole dataset is completed In the following section we detailed how the streaming algorithm performs the partitioning 2 Adjacency Greedy The essence of this algorithm is making decisions based on what is known so far This knowledge consists of two parts vertices already assigned to partitions and the current sub-graph in the stream-in buffer The information about the vertices is kept in the global index whose role is already detailed in our previous paper The sub-graph is kept in adjacency lists in the preparation step In the following the two parts are modeled for the purpose of illustrating the algorithm Deìnition 1 Global Index It is denoted as I   V P T W    where V is the vertex set T denotes the type of the vertex W denotes the assignment weight of vertex of V in a partition in P  P   1 N   The function   V   P T W  is a mapping function for the index There are two types of vertex one is subject vertex that denotes the subject resource of a RDF triple the other is object vertex that denotes the object resource of a RDF triple This model must satisfy the following each entry in the index is uniquely determined by a pair  v p   v  V  p  P  and any entry in the global index is an instance of this quadruple model I i means the set of global index entries of partition i  Deìnition 2 Stream-in Sub-graph The sub-graph that is temporarily kept in the buffer is denoted as G sub   539 


Algorithm 1 adjacency-greedy I  G sub  v  1 list Adjacency  G sub  v  2 For i in  1  N  do 3 4 w i  join i   i 5 assignment   i max w i  0<i N  6 return assignment         1       length list j V I v list c list Join i j j i Fig 4 Adjacency greedy algorithm V AdjList   V denotes the set of vertices in the graph AdjList    v c   v  V v   V  v  c    v v     The vertices in V is sorted by the value of c in descending order G sub can be a disconnected directed graph The algorithm does not consider self-edges The number of vertices in a partition must be less than double the window size Before discussing the algorithm there is an important issue about balancing during the partitioning to be considered During graph partitioning a highly connected vertex in a partition causes more vertices to be assigned to that same partition which can result in a bad partition balance Hence an adjustment factor should be determined and considered in computing assignment weight to control imbalances There are many options here in our research we use  i 1  p i    S  N   p i is the current size of the partition i when processing a vertex in the buffer 0 i  N  and N is the expected number of partitions S is the total number of data items in the dataset Adjacency  G sub v  is a function to map from a vertex v  v  G sub V to a instance of AdjList  I i V denotes the set of vertices already assigned in partition i  and appears in index I i  w i denotes the assignment weight of v in partition i w i  1  Algorithm 1 gives the method that selects a partition with the largest computed weight for a vertex v  For each partition P  it sums the weights of all edges in the buffer that connect v to a vertex that also appears in P  The partition with the highest weight is chosen If multiple partitions have the same weight the partition with largest join is selected following the greedy policy For other weight cases we just use random The complexity of this algorithm is O  N   This algorithm keeps the strongly connected vertices in the same partition As a result the total edges distributed on a boundary can be reduced because most edges are distributed in partitions in the more strongly connected sub-graphs Although this algorithm is good at clustering closely connected vertices as seen thus far it is possible to make a poor decision based only on partial knowledge Thus it is also possible to generate poor partitions with a large number of edge cuts This is all because the assignment suggestion is based on current stream-in triples and current sub-graphs of each partition However even with this weakness experiments still show us this streaming algorithm performs better than hash partitioning even in the worst case C Triple Allocation After a vertex assignment suggestion is generated by adjacency greedy or balance based random the nal assignment of the vertex and the placement of the vertex related triples must be determined In this step the triple allocation strategy can take the assignment suggestion made above or make its own decision In this part we proposed two strategies to cover the above issues for the nal vertex assignment decision and attached triples allocation 1 Strict Vertex Assignment Suggestion Follower In this strategy we make vertex assignment decisions and triple allocation strictly based on the vertex assignment suggestion from Greedy Adjacency or random allocation with size balance of so-far partitions This strategy is simple with no optimization Partition balancing only relies on the balance mechanism in the vertex assignment algorithm The quality of the partition directly relies on the vertex assignment algorithm 2 Assignment history considered In the model of deìnition 1 a weight eld is kept in I  which is used to keep the updated weight of a vertex assigned in a partition Every time a vertex is assigned to a partition in which it already exists the weight is updated according to its previous weight and the number of neighbors added by the new vertex For this strategy the vertex assignment history is considered when making a new assignment decision The history here means the existed entries for the vertex in the global index The accuracy of the adjacency greedy algorithm is decreased because vertex assignment suggestion is made based solely on the adjacency list of a vertex in the stream-in buffer and this adjacency list is not full for the vertex in the whole graph In order to make up for this weakness we designed a strategy to approximate the full adjacency list IV E XPERIMENTS In this section we evaluated the communication cost on three different RDF datasets with different features We evaluated the performance of our one pass streaming algorithm by comparing to ofîine algorithms Hash partitioning was used for performance comparison with our stream partitioning In our benchmark evaluation we compared the results among online hash and ofîine approaches Both our online partitioning and hash partitioning are compared to optimal algorithm performed by Metis in communication cost and also compared with each other The graph partitioner kemtis 5.0.2 is used as the graph partitioner with default setting for partitioning dataset mapped graph For this default setting partitioning scheme is multilevel k-way partitioningês objective function is edge cut minimization load imbalance factor is 1.136 For graph coarsening sorted heavy-edge matching is used for uncoarsening the number of iterations for the reìnement algorithm is 10 The hashing-based approach has the same basic setup and SHA-1 us used to hash the RDF subject A RDF Datasets In our experiment we used three different RDF datasets The rst was Uniprot Universal Protein Resource a central database of protein sequence and function created by joining the information contained in Swiss-Prot TrEMBL and PIR W e used part of the data from it to test the scalability of our algorithm and its performance on big data On this dataset we did experiments both with and without the common URI removal technique for which we removed triples which contain  rdf  type    rdf  predicate    rdf  object   and  rdf  subject   The second was the Linked Clinical Trial LinkedCT data of which is transformed from clinical trial data The proìles of the datasets are in T able I 540

partitioned to m parts in our experiments  m 20  40  60  80  100  where m is the desired number of partitions For online approach we use history section III.B as the triple allocation strategy for all m group experiments This group of algorithm conìguration performed better than other groups All the other conìguration options for experiments with each dataset are the same In online partitioning if the strongly-connected vertices are distributed evenly it can seed clusters of following vertices which produces fewer edge cuts The standard deviations of the size of all partitions in our online partitioning are better than that of hash partitioning For an actual querying comparison we compared the results among the three partitioning approaches online hash Metis by the ratio  real querying bytes/total benchmark query bytes   From the group of results in Fig 5 our online approach works better than the hash approach in actual querying on all datasets Also in this experiment we found a group of interesting results on dataset Uniprot-removed Its performance is better than ofîine approaches By checking the number of querying bytes used for each pattern query we found that for pattern  x  p 2 o   the ofîine approach sent many more bytes than our online one which results in its overall communication costs being larger than online one One reason for this is that we clustered RDF triples to partitions according to the partitioning of their RDF subject in ofîine dataset partitioning Thus for this RDF object star query pattern it does not work well Another nding here is that in actual querying evaluation our online partitioning algorithm performs close or better than ofîine partitioning By checking the number of bytes sent for querying by each query pattern the online one sent many fewer bytes than ofîine ones on pattern  s  p 1   x   x  p 2 o  and  x  p 2 o   Due to the fact that the ofîine graph partitioning partitions graph by vertex this means no one vertex can be assigned to two partitions without intentional replication hence many paths in the graph are cut However actually our online partitioning algorithm partitions by edges thus triples with the same RDF vertex can be allocated to different partitions Hence many paths connected to one vertex can be kept in the same partition And pattern  s  p 1   x   x  p 2 o  queries can still be treated well in the online partitioning Here we did not consider the replication issue Even if the algorithm produced some vertex replication that is generated naturally by the algorithm and not as the result of any intentional replication strategies Indeed from this nding we can develop a replication strategy to keep all edges un-cut on each vertex partition V R ELATED W ORK The dataset partitioning approach is an important way to distribute datasets into several parts for distributed processing and management There are many popular ways to do dataset partitioning Paper gi v e s a good summary on it such as round robin partitioning hash partitioning and range partitioning It also proposed inîuential factors in partitioning datasets Accordingly except for range partitioning the other two simply distribute data randomly Although range partitioning can maintain locality its performance strongly depends on the ordering property of the dataset that nearby data should be related In real applications the data of a dataset are related to each other If we just simply partition the dataset by the above approaches the relationships between data are broken and processing across partitions will result in poor performance Datasets with related data can in fact be mapped to a graph Thus many research approaches process relational datasets with graph algorithms For partitioning graph partitioning is the most famous one such as balanced graph partitioning and multilevel graph partition There are also man y graph partitioning tools that can scale well within a certain range such as Metis and Chaco 20 There is also research on using graph partitioning approaches to distribute dataset over clusters Paper used Metis as their graph partitioner to distribute RDF dataset over a Hadoop cluster Each node is equipped with a local RDF store It is related to our previous work but there is no speciìc index system using graph features of partitions in this paper Although the shown results are much better than hash partitioning scalability of using classic graph partitioning is limited for using it for big data problems Because graph partitioning is an NP-Hard problem even approximate algorithm will tak e O\(log n  based on the complete knowledge of the graph This is also the limitation of many ofîine algorithms for big data problems There is some research on using parallel graph partitioning to handle large scale graphs and speed up the partitioning process ParMetis e xtends the functionality pro vided by Metis and includes routines that are especially suited for parallel adapative mesh reìnement computations and large 541 


scale numerical simulations Paper used e xplicit graph information to perform incremental graph partitioning using recursive spectral bisection algorithm It also used a linear programming approach to adjust the incremental graph with minimum vertex movement minimum edge cut and balanced partition However these approaches are limited by needing the whole knowledge of the graph Streaming algorithms are one approach to processing large scale datasets Stream graph partitioning proposed one pass k partitioning algorithms to partition a large scale graph Our work is related but in their approach they still need full knowledge of all neighbors of a vertex and their processing space is O\(n Although it can scale for some large datasets for big data problems the size of the dataset would exceed available memory In that case O\(n is unacceptable And having the full neighbor information for a large graph dataset is also difìcult plus the data ordering in natural datasets is unpredictable Therefore our research proposes a more exible approach for streaming partitioning a graph in a scalable and memory friendly way A number of papers about distributed RDF triple store proposed their own approaches to partitioning RDF dataset and designed their own querying systems RDFPeers proposed a scalable distributed RDF repository based on a structured P2P network It places a triple on different peers by hashing on subject predicate and object respectively Each triple has three copies in the system By this way RDFPeers sends RDF queries to peers by hashing on the non-variable part of query patterns As an advantage this approach can scale up to a large triple dataset As a deìciency hops for querying generate more than one query message for a query so that the communication cost of the system would be high Similar research projects building distributed RDF stores are in Atlas Some graph data management and processing applications such as YARS2 and V irtuoso 27 generally hash par tition RDF triples across multiple machines and parallelize access to these machines as much as possible at query time Google Pregel used hashing to distrib ute v erte x for management and processing InìniteGraph adopted hash sharding but made I/O between nodes parallel and faster Neo4J used cache sharding and Neo4J HA for scaling large dataset but the full dataset is expected to be present on each database instance Hash partitioning breaks links among data and will result in heavy I/O among nodes for complex join queries Cache sharding can still cause heavy I/O among servers for big data problem VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK Online graph partitioning approaches to large distributed graph dataset management are a promising new approach to big data processing and integration for data-driven science and engineering In this paper we presented an online graph partitioning approach to distribute large datasets Vertex assignment algorithms provide suggestions to distribute a vertex The triple allocation strategies use the vertex assignment suggestion and previous knowledge of partitions to make vertex assignment decisions and allocate the triples As shown in our experiments our approach and strategies performs consistently better than hash partitioning approach For our future work rst we plan to develop a replication approach that can complement our partitioning approach and lower communication cost and high workload balance for a cluster system Second we will design a new efìcient and more scalable indexing system for applying our partitioning
