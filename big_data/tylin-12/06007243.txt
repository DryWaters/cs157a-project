The analysis was made using capitalization rules based into two wages cycles, as recommended by Brazilian Electrical Energy Agency - ANEEL In addition, it is also discussed, briefly, a comparison made with the traditional method using the present value of transformer losses costs. Finally, authors propose a methodology to study the application of efficient transformers to replace the ones standardized by Brazilian normative association, ABNT Keywords-loading; Economical viability analysis, payback energy factor, energy efficiency, transformers I  I NTRODUCTION  Distribution transformers are equipments that present a high performance, about 99%. Although, when used in electrical networks, considering different voltage levels, the total amount of losses can be considerably high When an efficiency increase is desired, it is necessary to decrease the load and no load lo sses. Therefore, increasing the efficiency depends on the dimensions, quality and quantity of materials used for the transformer\222s core and windings and no additional technological innovation is necessary No load losses are related to the core project. If silicon steel is used, the core must present larger dimensions, so that the magnetic flow can be reduced. Load losses are related to the windings design so that, when the conductors section is increased the current density is decreased, reducing the load losses In general, transformers must be designed according to losses levels established in technical standards. Actually, there is no common definition about high efficiency transformers Each standard and each country define their own limits taking into account losses, costs or the production of transformers over a certain period An economical viability study for a transformer design indicates is the design is feasible or not, considering its costs This paper presents a study based on data supplied by AES Sul, a Brazilian power distribution company, using the rules imposed by Brazilian Electrical Energy Agency \226 ANEEL for investment analysis Previous studies [1 s in g th e P HOP HE T Meth o d in d i cate that this kind of studies may result in feasible projects with a payback time smaller than 5 years II  I NVESTIMENT CALCULATION  Using ANEEL rules, the payback for the investment in transformers, for tariffs adjustment, are calculated using five years cycles. For AES Sul, the last cycle for tariff adjustment begun in 2008. According to ANEEL\222s methodology, the profits with losses reduction by the replacement of equipments are calculated only in the period for the first cycle after the tariffs adjustment and do not depend on the year the investment was made. As a consequence, the capitalization period range from five to zero years. After finishing the first period, the investment is calculated according to the return on assets. The economical analysis presented in this paper includes a period of 10 years A  Profits for the First Period of Tariff Adjustment According to ANEEL regulation, the profits for the first period of tariff adjustment are due to the losses reduction obtained with the replacement of standard transformers by efficient ones At first place, it is necessary to consider the investment with the transformers replacement, represented by TR C 002  Costs Difference between standard and efficient transformers This difference is remunerated by costs of load and no load losses during the analysis time. Costs for maintenance and installation are not considered in this study Costs for no load and load losses, based on the rated losses of transformers, are calculated by expressions in \(1\d \(2 values using Brazilian currency \(R  N WO WO W  T C   1 Modern Electric Power Systems 201 0, Wroclaw, Poland MEPS\22210 \226 paper P02 http://www.meps10.pwr.wroc.pl

Results are shown in Table 2 It can be seen, in Table 2, that a positive cash flow can be obtained, with a payback time of 10 years, if a high value of FE and a small costs difference is used. It is also possible to see that, for a fixed payback time, decreases in the FE result in reduction in the manufacturing costs TABLE II  C ASH FLOW FOR YEAR 2009  C E  P R FE Present Value \(R 1,000.00 5 447.11 10 360.85 15 274.60 500.00 5 132.66 10 46.40 15 39.85 Costs difference for Present Value = 0 426.22 10 0.00 563.37 15 0.00 FE for Present Value = 0 500.00 12.69 0.00 750.00 21.80 0.00 Nota Costs difference considering FE = 10 and 15 and a 10 years payback and analysis time FE difference considering costs difference equal to R 500.00 and R$ 750.00 and payback and analysis time of 10 years  Table 3 shows some aspects related to “the best year to initiate the investments” in efficient transformers. Payback and analysis time were considered constant and equal do 10 years. Present values are referred to year 2009 and the FE is also constant and equal do 12. It means that load losses during a daily cycle match with the operation of transformers using rated power during half a day TABLE III  P ARAMETERS FOR THE INVESTMENT ECONOMICAL ANALYSIS  Beginning of investment  C E  P R Present value \(R 2009 1.000,00 326,35 2010 314,80 2011 309,64 2012 309,84 2009 500,00 11,90 2010 49,58 2011 86,45 2012 122,38  Considering investment values and energy factor – FE presented, independently of the year for the beginning of investment, the projects are economically feasible as the present values are always negative. Analyzing data in Table 3 there is no straight relation linking the year for the beginning 


of investment and present value. Anyway, in cases where the investment is considered high, there is a tendency to reduce economical losses \(increase in profits\s the time for the beginning of investment is closer to the end of the tariff’s adjustment cycle, implying in a larger weight for the return on assets. On the other hand, if the cases with a small investment are considered, there is a te ndency to reduce economical losses as the beginning of investment is close to the beginning of tariff’s adjustment cycle, implying in a larger weight for the present value of losses costs, assumed as constant Figure 2 depicts this tendency for several investment difference values, FE equal to 12 and losses and energy costs according to Table 1. For each economical data and losses set there is a difference between transformers costs that updates the present value to a fixed value. For this example, this costs difference is equal to R$ 900.00. Smaller values indicate that it is more opportune to invest in the beginning of the first cycle of tariff’s adjustment. On the other hand, larger values make it more appropriate to invest in the end of the first cycle of adjustment. From the exposed data, it is possible to verify that only differences in transformers costs below R$ 200.00 result in positive present values  Figure 2  Present Value versus Investment Year – FE = 12 Figure 3 depicts the influence of the reduction of spent energy factor. According to this figure, reductions in energy factor imply in modifications for the characteristics “Present Value x Investment Year”.  It is possible to notice a displacement, with no tendency, of the transformers’ costs difference bringing the present value to a constant cost Taking technical limitations of this study into account, for FE 3, it is possible to notice a tendency to define a cost difference between standard and efficient transformers about R$ 100.00 to R$ 150.00  Figure 3  Present value versus Investment Year – FE = 3 Table 4 presents variations for the investment year and transformers’ cost difference so that it is possible to find an energy factor to make the cash flow equal to zero. This is important information, as it is related with the minimum load to make the efficient transformer project become feasible according to adopted technical and economical limitations TABLE IV  FE VALUES FOR A NULL CASH FLOW CONSIDERING A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS  Beginning of investment   C E  P R Spent Energy Factor - FE 2009 750.00 21.80 2010  2011  2012  2009 500.00 12.69 2010 16.03 2011 23.08 2012  2009 250.00 3.58 2010 5.25 2011 8.77 2012 19.72 Note Values above 24 hours B  Present Value of Losses Costs Equation \(15\ represents the usual model to calculate de benefits associated to the use of efficient transformers, based in the conception of present value of losses costs       1 n 1 n p 1 E  1 P j 1  j 1    j 1  C V         2 5 2 5 2 n p 1 E  2 P j   j 1  1  j 1    j 1  C V  2009 2010 2011 2012 Ano do Investimento 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 10 0 Valor Presente R Difere nça de C ustos R   1.500,00 1.000,00 500,00 100,00 FE 3 P r e s e n t Va l u e [R  Investment y ear Costs difference [R 2009 2010 2011 2012 An o d o I nve st i men to 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 100 200 300 Valor Pres ente R Diferença deCustos[R  1.500,00 1.000,00 500,00 100,00 FE  12 P r ese n t Va l u e [R Investment year Costs difference [R

In these cases, as an example, for FE = 3, basis year and investment year 2009, costs differences equal to R$ 1,200.00 and an analysis time of 10 years, ANEEL’s method presents a present value of R$ - 607.39, against R$ - 900.59. On the other hand, considering a cost difference of only R$ 200.00 ANEEL’s method presents a present value of R$ 21.51 against R$ 99.41. For high investment costs \(see figures 2 and 3\he assets amortization is predominant. In cases where the investment costs are small, the present value of losses costs is predominant for the return on assets IV  C ONCLUSION  The results presented in this paper reproduce distinctive conditions of winding and core losses in transformers obtained from manufacturers. A reduction of these losses was considered to calculate hypothetical costs to be paid, as though as its reflections on the investment payback. In the used examples, a difference for the core losses of about 30 W reduction of 13.6%\d winding losses of 130 W \(reduction of 16.7%\ents a difference for the investment costs in the range of R$ 100.00 to R$ 1,500.00. Some technical aspects were not taken into account, as the hypothesis that larger costs differences must result in smaller losses As noticed in table 2, considering the limits indicated above, large differences for the investment costs request large spent energy factors, above 12 hours a day in full load. On the other hand, small energy factors, around 3 hours a day in full load, implies in the necessity of smaller costs differences around R$ 200.00 \(Figure 4 It is not possible to indicate directly which the best methodology for investment payback is. It seems that, for each pattern of losses reduction, there is an investment that results approximately in the same present value, considering the same period of analysis. This value depicts boundaries between the regions where the return on assets or the present value of losses costs are predominant. Consequently, considering the possibility of small investments, considering energy factors below 5 hours per day at full load, it is possible to deal with maximum investment differences in the order of R$ 400.00 Finally, the usage of efficient transformers needs to consider the models for investment payback, losses profits and assets amortization, as proposed by ANEEL, so that it can become economically feasible. The variables that take part in this process present strong correlations and each case must be studied in particular. Calculation procedures must take into account load measurements, as indicated by the consumed energy factor \(FE\which is related to the transformer thermal model and its time constants. To make the whole process reasonable, i.e., smaller costs to result in larger profits with losses reduction, the model for investment payback according to present value of losses cost s must be considered. After the attainment of the most appropriate losses configuration and presentation of the final transformer project to manufacturers the values for losses and costs must be reassessed   according to ANEEL’s proposal for return on assets R EFERENCES  1  Picanço, Alessandra, F. \(2006 Avaliação econômica de transformadores de distribuição com base no carregamento e eficiência energética Master’s Thesis.

In all the other remaining techniques some do not use graph structure, some of them do not support scalability and some lack tool support V  C ONCLUSION  Web usage mining is an emerging area to find the access patterns from the web. Access patterns can provide the valuable information about user behaviors, life time value of customers cross marketing strategies across products, and effectiveness of promotional campaigns.  We focused on web usage mining techniques in this survey paper and reviewed the challenges issues and techniques for finding sequential patterns. We divided the techniques in three groups i.e. Clustering Association and Markov Model based techniques. Our findings indicate that clustering is the best choice for sequential pattern mining and the techniques by Sarukkai [7 Zhu e t  a l    8  based on Markov Models and are the best according to our assessment criteria. We have further analyzed that the hybrids of different techniques can also be used to find sequential patterns in web usage mining data to gain more efficient results.
