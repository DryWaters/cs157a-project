all of the traf田 volume\(High/Middle/Low are predicted for all of the sections on road networks A Traf田 Simulator Each section between two intersections in the road networks has two directions and we assume each direction of the section represents different literals i.e items or attributes The traf田 simulator used in our simulations consists of the road model with 7  7 roads like Fig.6 i.e each section has the same length all cars have the same speed for simplicity and the shape of the total road is like a grid network Time shift in road setting in Fig.6 represents the time delay of the traf田 lights between neighboring intersections Actually the cars on the road networks do not have the same speed Every time unit all the cars can move forward by length 1 if and only if there exist spaces before them thus the actual speed of all cars are in盃enced by the traf田 lights or traf田 jams For example if a car encounters the red light or traf田 jam it has to wait until the red light period passes or all the hindrances before it are removed Therefore the cars have different speeds depending on the concrete traf田 situations   N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 W2 W1 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 E2 E1 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 represent car   represent O/D name representsectionfromintersectionW2N4toW2N5 representsectionfrom intersectionW2N5toW2N4  represent intersection W3N3 Road Setting Maximum number of cars 10 cars per section Car arrival distribution exponential distribution Red traffic light 10 time units Green traffic light 7timeunits Yello w traffic light 3timeunits Time shift 10 time units Fig 6 Road model used in simulations TABLE III P ARAMETER SETTING FOR EVOLUTION Items Values Number of judgment nodes 100 Number of processing nodes 10 Number of attributes 224 Number of attributes including classes 672 Number of time units 800 Number of generations per round 100 Minimum support value 0.1 Minimum con電ence value 0.8 Minimum chi-squared value 6.63 The parameter setting of the proposed data mining is presented in Table 3 The attributes correspond to the judgment node functions for example the class of the attribute  W 4 N 6 W 4 N 7 Low   can be interpreted in such a way that the section named W 4 N 6 W 4 N 7  has low traf田 volume We have 7  8  2 112 sections in our simulator and each section has two directions so there exist 112  2  224 sections in total What尽 more each section has 3 categories High/Mid/Low thus we have 224  3  672 attributes including classes Time units in Table 3 represents the number of total time units in our database B Simulation 1 In simulation 1 the number of rules stored in the rule pool is compared between the proposed method with Generalized GNP and conventional method with Normal GNP Each round has the same number of generations of 50 and the chosen set size for AAM is 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Rounds Total Number of Rules Extracted Generalized GNP Conventional GNP Fig 7 Total number of rules extracted 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Round Number of Rules Extracted Generalized GNP Conventional GNP Fig 8 The number of rules extracted per each round Fig.7 shows the number of rules obtained in the rule pool versus round number In the conventional method GNP individuals have only the Yes-side connection while Generalized GNP individuals have multi-branches like Fig.3 in the proposed method We can see from Fig.7 that the proposed method can extract important class association rules ef田iently when compared with the conventional one Fig.8 shows the number of rules extracted per each round Although in some rounds we can obtain more than 500 rules the average number of rules extracted per round is not high We can see that there exist some rare cases where 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 2659

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
