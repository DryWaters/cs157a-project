to decide two codewords will be modiìed to c0 or c255 Thus the codeword with the minimum MSE value between c0 and the codeword itself will be changed to c0 Similarly the codeword with the minimum MSE value between c255 and the codeword itself will be changed to c255 Besides since the codebook applied in our method is grayscale the extracted watermark will be in grayscale form However in order to make objective comparisons between our approach and the e xtracted grayscale w atermark will be polarized That is the pixels with values larger than or equivalent to 128 will be reset to 255 and the pixels with values smaller than 128 will be reset to 0 respectively Fig 2 shows watermarked images and the corresponding extracted watermarks of the proposed method Table I shows that the value of PSNR of watermarked images with different sizes of watermarks in the proposed method is greater than the value of PSNR of watermarked images in Shen and Ren method It means that the watermarked image of our proposed method have better image quality Since NC value can be anywhere between 0 and 1 The closer the NC value is to 1 the higher the accuracy is for the extracted watermark So the extracted watermark of our proposed method is more accuracy than the extracted watermark of Shen and Renês method Also the well-known image processing software Photoshop is applied to perform 32 image attacks including JPEG lossy compression quality level 0 1 2 12 sharpening 1-3 times adding in Gaussian noise   2,4,6,8 10 15 and 20 blurring 1-3 times and 6 kinds of cropping methods on the watermark images Then NC is used to compare the difference between the original watermark and the extracted watermark After applying 6 kinds of cropping attacks JPEG lossy compression quality level  0 sharpening three times adding in Gaussian noise    20 and blurring three times to watermarked images of the proposed method and Shen and Renês method we can obtain the corresponding extracted watermarks Table II shows that no matter which kinds of attacks the watermarked images suffer from extracted watermarks are still similar with the watermark extracted from non-attacked watermarked image Moreover NC values calculated from extracted watermarks using the proposed method outperform Shen and Renês method especially in case of Gaussian noise and blurring Table I PSNR OF WATERMARKING IMAGE AND NC OF ITS WATERMARK EXTRACTION  watermark PSNR NC PSNR NC Size proposed proposed Shen  Ren Shen  Ren method method method method 64  64 31.9998 0.9928 30.8683 0.9872 128  128 31.8379 0.9871 30.7539 0.9772 256  128 31.8379 0.9875 30.7493 0.9843 a 512  512 original image b 128  128 watermark c Watermarked image d Extracted watermark with PSNR  30.8466\(dB with NC  0.9948 Figure 3 Watermarking image and its watermark extraction Finally we use another 512  512 image Mandril and another watermark to emphasis that the proposed method can be easily applied in different kinds of protected images Figs 3\(a and 3\(b are the original images 128  128 watermark Figs 3\(c is the corresponding watermarked image It is noticed that PSNR values of the watermarked image is smaller than watermarked image Lena since the codebook was trained using Lena only Figs 3\(d shows the extracted watermark Then we also apply the same image processings JPEG lossy compression quality level  0 sharpening three times adding in Gaussian noise    20 and blurring three times to the watermarked image we obtain the corresponding extracted watermarks and there NC values are shown in table III V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper a robust watermarking technique is proposed using vector quantization VQ and association rules 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 827

For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
