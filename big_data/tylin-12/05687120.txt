Development of Knowledge Model for Insurance Product Decision using the Associative Classification Approach Azuraliza Abu Bakar, Zalinda Othman, Mohd Saiful Nizam Md Yusoff & Ruhaizan Ismail Centre for Artificial Intelligence Technology Faculty of Information Science and Technology Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Malaysia aab@ftsm.ukm.my, zalinda@ftsm.ukm.my, ruhaizanismail@yahoo.com Abstract Individual protection, physically or mentally, is very important for someone living in a risk environment Insurance is one of the individual protections due to accident blaze, critical diseases or death. Insurance company plays a critical role in providing competitive product insurance that covers flexible features depend on customer requirements. In order to compete with other competitors and fulfill the customer needs, the company needs a wise and proper business strategy. The insurance company needs extra knowledge on the potential customer whom can give a positive response to the insurance product being offered. In this paper we proposed an associative classification model to develop a knowledge model for determining the best class solution for insurance policy dataset. We enhanced the classification-based association of associative classification by using a heuristic to process two types of decision rules. The decision rules types were the correctly classified rules and the verified uncertain classified rules. The finding showed that the type of products could be proposed in a new insurance policy based on individual profiles Keywords-associative; association rule; classification insurance I I NTRODUCTION Individualês protection is very important both in physical or mental form when living in a risk environment. Insurance is one of the individual protections that cover a person from problem such as accident, blaze, critical diseases or death Insurance company plays a critical role in providing competitive and flexible insurance product that covers customer requirements. Currently with a number of insurance products in the market and in order to be able to compete with other competitors, insurance company needs a wise and proper business strategy. Knowledge in identifying potential customers whom will give positive response to the product being offered is crucial and will benefit the company. The knowledge may in terms of a specific pattern on customer characteristics that always buy on certain insurance products. This knowledge can improve the company revenue resources if they use in the right way They may offer more friendly services to customers. The quality of the decision can be improved and this will give a positive impact to the company. To get knowledge and quality information, data mining can be applied to the insurance industry. This technique is widely used in various domains such as medical, marketing, banking and science in supplying useful and quality information In this study, one of the data mining techniques, the associative classification approach will be used to find interesting relationship and frequent pattern in insurance data. An association rules mining is a well-known approach in generating huge number of rules. The discovered rules then will be transformed into the classification rules. The generated rules can be used to assist the company in expanding their business by offering more competitive insurance products and reducing insurance cancellation rate Also, it can focus on the potential customers whom capable of buying insurance and maintaining the insurance. This brings profits to customers and the company. Therefore, this technique offers a huge benefit to company insurance in expanding their business segmentations. The insurance data used in this study are obtained from an insurance company in Malaysia and it contains 200,000 records with 74 attributes. These records contain customer data such as name, age, race, religion, premium amount, policy status and address of the policy holders There are often a huge number of association rules discovered in a data mining practice, making it difficult for users to identify those that are of particular interest to them. Therefore, it is important to remove insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well as summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules Moreover, the information obtained from traditional association rules are very limited, so new forms of association rules are needed to discover useful and actionable knowledge This paper is organized into five sections. The related work of associative classification model and insurance domain will be discussed in section II. Section III and IV present the main methodology of our associative classification modeling and experiments. Finally, section V concludes the work in this paper II R ELATED W ORK Associative classification is a data mining approach of using association rules mining to construct a classification model. This approach is commonly employed when there are a vast amount of data and a lot of information need to be 1481 978-1-4244-8136-1/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


discovered from the data. It also used when the actual class of the data is uncertain to the researcher and post mining of association may support the identification of appropriate attributes. There are several techniques in associative classification as discussed in u ch as th e C l as s i f i catio n  based on Predictive Association Rules \(CPAR Classification based on Multiple Association Rules CMAR Multi Class classification based on Association Rules \(MCAR\d Multi Label Associative Classification MMAC\he main functions of these algorithms are employing different rule discovery, rule ranking, rule pruning, rule prediction and rule evaluation methods Recently, the data mining technology has been supporting the statistical techniques in solving business problem. In particular, data mining improves the existing predictive models by investigating the new form of rules that are more meaningful and interesting. The predictive models that are able to predict the behavior and relationship among data will strongly support the process of decision making thus enhanced the quality of companyês strategic planning and business intelligen T h e m a in c h alle n g e  in sustaining a business is to increase the number of new customer and to fulfil various customer needs. Recently, the term business intelligence used in business is commonly associated with data mining. In business intelligence satisfying the customer needs is the main aim of a company Thus, a company needs to investigate and do research on how to strategize their products in fulfilling these needs. In insurance industry, companies are aggressively offering various insurance products to attract customers Understanding the demographic and cutomer personal profiles leads to a new view in setting and offering better products. The policy holder interests in having more than one insurance policies is higher than obtaining a single policy only [2,3,4,5  Th eref ore, i t i s g ood f o r a company to plan for a new insurance product that support various customer needs to make the customer financially managable. Indirectly, the company gains more profits in retaining the customer with that special policy product In this study, we propose a data mining approach called associative classification to discover important association and relationship within large amount of insurance dataset These data associations will be processed using the classification-based association \(CBA\hniqu w h ere  important knowledge model is obtained.

The preprocessing stage involves data cleaning, data reduction and data transformation h e pu rpos e of dat a cleaning stage is to handle the missing values and to smooth out the noises. This is important to ensure a consistent dataset for further mining processes. The continuous valued attributes are transformed into categorical values and reduced to limited categories to ensure the efficiency of the mining process. The main challenge in preprocessing the data was to perform a data reduction process where several identified attributes have to be removed. These attributes were the redundant attributes, key attributes and attributes with low data distribution. During the data reduction process, many redundant attributes have been identified and removed from the data set. This leaved eight most relevant attributes B Association Rules Mining In this study we propose an Apriori Algorithm for the association rules mining to find association within the insurance data The apriori algorithm generates the frequent patterns of the data prepared in the form of transactions  It g e n e rates rules a n d th es e r u les  w i l l be fu rth er  processed in the post mining stage. Apriori algorithm generally performs two important tasks; generation of frequent pattern candidates and generation of rules The rules generated during this process can be measured in terms of the confidence and support value measurement The support value measures how frequent an item occurs and the confidence value measures the strength of the generated rules. The minimum value of support \(min_sup and confidence \(min_conf\rmined to control the quality and the amount of generated rules. Various threshold values are suggested for both measures [10, 11 In th is study the initial min_sup was set to 10% and the initial min_conf was set to 80%. Several different minimum support and confidence values were used in the experiments to ensure the generated rules represent many frequent cases and attributes. The consistent values of min_conf and min_sup indicated the obtained rules are consistent and reliable The Apriori algorithm was run on the insurance dataset based on individual product. The results from our initial experiment indicated that the best initial min_support and min_conf obtained were 10% and 80% respectively Therefore, these initial measures were used on the other different products data. Table II shows the example of association rules generated from the DACP insurance product. Five sets of association rules from each product were generated and the rules were further analyzed in the next stage of the experiment TABLE II E XAMPLE OF A SSOCIATION R ULES FOR DACP P RODUCT R1 LA RACE=CHI LA ENTRY AGE=A04 871 ==> LA Marital=Married 866    conf:\(0.99  R2 LA RACE=CHI LA_Status_Smoker=Non-smoker LA ENTRY AGE=A04 861 ==> LA Marital=Married 856    conf:\(0.99 R3 Status=Inforce LA RACE=CHI LA ENTRY AGE=A04 840 ==> LA Marital=Married 835    conf:\(0.99\ Status=Inforce LA RACE=CHI LA_Status_Smoker=Non-smoker LA ENTRY AGE=A04 830 ==> LA Marital=Married 825    conf:\(0.99 R4 LA Gender=Male LA ENTRY AGE=A04 637 ==> LA Marital=Married 633    conf:\(0.99 R5 6.

This situation such as rules redundancy will always occurs. Therefore, it is important to remove insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well as summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules The generated association rules are further analyzed to identify the appropriate class attribute for associative classification. Four post mining steps are adapted in this study: i\ removing the redundancy in association rules, ii summarization and generalization of association rules, iii clustering the association rules and iv\ associative classifier. The association rules mining are filtered by identifying the redundant rules where some rules can be subsumed by other rules. The summarization and generalization of rules involves searching for rules that satisfy certain minimum confidence. In this study, the minimum confidence is determined by simulating series of confidence values to find one suitable values to be the threshold confidence. This work is tedious and time consuming. Finally, the frequency of the attributes at the antecedent of the rules is computed and the potential class attribute with the highest frequency will be considered as the class attribute. In this study, the insurance product name is focused to be the potential class and therefore the associative classifier was obtained using this attribute 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1483 


D Associative Classification Model Development Association rules mining have shown interesting findings in discovering interesting rules in data. Recently the association rules have been actively used for effective classification. This is due to their corresponding associations that have an interesting relationship between attribute condition and class attribute. In this study, we used the classification-based association \(CBA\ that uses an iterative approach to frequent itemset mining  In general CBA was empirically found to be more accurate than C4.5 on a good number of datas We enhance the CBA by introducing a heuristic to construct the classifier with the following steps Step 1: Organize rules in decreasing precedence based on confidence and support Step 2: If a set of rules has the same antecedent, then the rules with highest confidence   is selected to represent the set Step  3: Classify the test data using the first rule method Step 4: Classify the test data on correctly classified and uncertainly classified Step 5: Verification of uncertainly classified rules by expert Step 6: Construct the knowledge model based on classified and the verified uncertainly classified rules IV E XPERIMENTS A Experimental Setup In this study, we used datasets from five types of insurance product: Dynamic Asia Capital Protected \(DACP4564 records\oup Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance GMRTA-29854 records\ire Purchase Reducing Term Assurance \(HPRTA-8729 records\dic Freedom MEDF2-5922 records\d FD Freedom \(PEFD1-2444 records\The initial threshold values of min_sup and min_conf of every product were determined from our initial parameter settings that were 10% for min_sup and 80% for min_conf. However, various parameter settings were still being used to ensure the stability of the selected parameters Various sizes of rules were obtained from these parameters settings. The association rules mining towards the five insurance product has produced many rules with various confidence values and the combination of items. The total of 1818 rules were generated for the DACP product, 1044 rules for GMRT product, 2409 for the HPRTA product 2252 with MEDF2 product and 628 rules for PEDF1 product. For each generation of association rules, the interesting and strong rules were determined for summarization and generalization of association rules. The strong rules are obtained by determining the difference between the confidence value of the rules and the minimum confidence value The strong and interesting rules \(that obtained after the post mining stage\ined as the rules that have confidence ranges between 80% to 100%. In this study we obtained 14 rules from DACP, 13 rules from GMRTA, 11 rules from HPRTA, 11 rules from MEDF2, and 9 rules from PSFDI insurance products. Later, we filtered again all the rules together and obtained three interesting rules from each product. Therefore for the classification model, we obtained 15 association rules. Table III depicted the association rules generated for insurance product profile data. The next section will discuss how the associative model is constructed from these association rules B Results We used the generated rules for testing the accuracy of the associative classification rules. The testing is conducted by reconstructing the rules. In the rules reconstruction, the consequent part of the rule is the product class and the existing consequent becomes the antecedent. All rules were used to test the unseen cases and the classification accuracy was recorded. The total of one hundred test data was taken from all products classes where 20 data from each class were selected. These data were the unseen examples that not been used for mining. A simple voting procedure was used for classification. The experimental results were noted by the percentage of correct classification and uncertain classification The uncertain classification indicates that the records are uncertainly classified by having more than one product class In this case the uncertain classified records were further analyzed to verify whether these records could also be classified with other product class. If the verification is true then, the consequence part of the rules is added with the selection of two or more products In this study, the experimental results obtained 58% correctly classified records and 42% uncertain classified records. The rules that contributed to the uncertain classified records were then investigated by the insurance experts and are verified whether it is possible to offer more than one product with the same cases. Therefore, the associative classification rules obtained from this study is showed in Table IV. The insurance experts verified that the generated rules indicated that the company could offer a combination of products or an alternative product to the potential customers. For example, the insurance company can offer either product DACP or GMRTA if the applicant fulfils the condition in R1 1484 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications

We enhance the CBA algorithm by introducing a heuristic in processing the extracted rules Two types of rules are observed i.e. rules obtained from the correctly classified data and rules constructed from the uncertain classified data. The uncertain classified rules are constructed by considering the decision made by the classification rules and by the original data decision. Policy product expert verified these rules and the rules with alternative decision are obtained. The knowledge model obtained in this study is yet to be employed in the full working system To conclude in business term, the insurance company can offer more than one different plans in one policy or a clustered insurance policy. For example, customer can have both life and car insurance in a single policy. This will give the value added to insurance product as well as the company sustainability. The product will be more competitive and flexible to the customers 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1485

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
