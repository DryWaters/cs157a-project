Lemma 2 The time complexity of HPAR algorithm is O\(|FT| + |Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where FT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2-itemsets Proof The time complexity estimated here is based on the number of operations required on itemsets.  To find all frequent 1-itemsets in line one, it takes O\(|FT operations On line two, there are at most Y number of frequent target items.  For each of these items, the following operations are executed.  To find frequent 2-itemsets, it is line 2.2 that calculating cross-table itemsets will require most operations It takes O\(|FT operations to scan the fact table again Assuming the maximum number of frequent 2-itemset is l 2  step 2.4 and step 2.5.6 perform sorting of these frequent 2itemsets repeatedly.  It would require O l 2 2 logl 2 2 operations  In total, the estimated operation is O\(|FT Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 For joining-then-mining approach, a straight forward calculation of predictive association rule is to join the fact table with all dimension tables and then perform Apriori algorithm.  Let JT = FT DT 1  DT n be the joined table.  If we apply same strategy to reduce the confidence of an association rule, then time complexity can be estimated similarly Lemma 3 The time complexity of joining-then-hiding approach is O\(|JT| + |Y|*\(|JT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where JT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2itemsets Proof The proof is similar to lemma 2 It can be observed that the joined table JT is much bigger than the fact table FT as JT contains attributes from all dimension tables.  The operations on joined table will be much more than operations on fact table along.  In addition the cost of joining and memory space to save the joined table must be considered VI C ONCLUSION In this work, we have studied the problem of hiding sets of predictive association rules on multiple tables of star schema.  We propose a novel technique addressing two issues Ö efficient calculation of itemsets and reduction of rule confidence. Examples illustrating the proposed approach are shown.  Analyses are given and compared to joined table approach.  Currently we have implemented the proposed technique on single table and experimenting on multiple tables.  We will continue to examine and improve the various side effects of the proposed approach.  We will also consider utilizing better data structures to reduce database scanning for better efficiency A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under grant NSC-98-2221-E-390-030 R EFERENCES 1 R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
