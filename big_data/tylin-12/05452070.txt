INTRODUCTION Dissolved gas analysis \(DGA\ is one of the most useful techniques, which are used to detect the incipient faults of power transformer[1 Th e f ault r e l ated gases incl ude methane \(CH 4 C 2 H 2 e \(C 2 H 6 ne C 2 H 4 In the past decade[2  variou s f a ult di ag no s i s  techniques have been proposed that include the conventional ratio method to detect the incipient faults of power transformer[3  Th e co n v entiona l gas rati o m e tho d i s  based on experience in fault diagnosis using DGA data  Rough set is a new mathematical approach, which has the function of imprecision, vagueness and uncertainty[4,5   Rough set philosophy is founded on the assumption that we associate some information[6 n t he paper, as sociat io n rules will be gained by rough set, and used to fault diagnosis of power transformer. Rough set can mine the deep relation, association rules of power transformer is gained by rough set. CH 4 C 2 H 4   C 2 H 2 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 6  C 2 H 2 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 6 CH 4   C 2 H 2 CH 4 can reveal the relation between the gases ratios and failure in power transformer and the feature gases are used to construct 6 ratios. By reduction of rough set, redundant feature attribute which affects the classification performance will be deleted. Then association rules of power transformer is gained. The experimental results indicate that the method has very good results  II. ROUGH SET Rough set is a very important information processing tool, by the tool, the problem with imprecise, uncertain and vague information will be solved. Define an information system S  U  A  V  f where U denotes a nonempty finite set A denotes a nonempty finite set of attributes A  C D  where C represents the conditional attributes D represents the decision attributes V is the value domain f is an information function. It is necessary for us to find out the key conditional attributes with the reference to the decision-making because the decision table obtained may be huge. The process of rough sets will comprise the following parts 1\ the data is not discrete, the data must be scattered 2\n table will be constructed by using all descriptors, and discernibility matrix will be constructed by using all descriptors 3\n table will be constructed by using specific reduct, discernibility matrix will be constructed by using specific reduct 4\edundant condition attributes are deleted, and the repetitious rows are deleted  III. ASSOCIATION RULES GAINED BY ROUGH SET The fault related gases include methane \(CH 4  acetylene \(C 2 H 2 ethane \(C 2 H 6 ethylene \(C 2 H 4 which can reflect the states of transformer CH 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 2 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 2 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 6 CH 4   C 2 H 2 CH 4 can reveal the relation between the gases ratios and failure in power transformer, and the feature gases are used to construct 6 ratios. As shown in Tab.1, condition attribute of decision table of power transformer is composed of the following ratios: CH 4 C 2 H 4   C 2 H 2 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 6  C 2 H 2 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 6 CH 4   C 2 H 2 CH 4   which are represented as  F 1  F 6 respectively. Condition attribute of diagnostic decision table is the five states of power transformer including normal, high energy discharge, low energy discharge, high temperature overheating, low temperature overheating, which are represented as 1,2,3,4,5 respectively By the reduction of rough set, minimal decision table is gained, which is given in Tab.2 Volumn 3  978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEE C

In Table 3 the competences shown in bold italics are where there is a statistically significant difference between the Bachelor and Master level responses. The direction of the difference can be understood by looking at the value of the means There are some significant differences between the study levels. çKnowledge of a second languageé is top at both levels At Master level students consider çInternational Relations and Collaborationsé in the top 5 along with çCapacity for applying knowledge in practi ceé. This s uggests that at Masters level capacity of applying knowledge in practice, for example, with a larger gap, is either being taken for granted at this level or is not being developed as much as the pure theoretical aspects of the discipline. Students clearly perceive the need for knowing how to apply this knowledge in practice There are some differences between countries with, for example, the difference in çInternational Relations and Collaborationsé being 1.1 in France, 0.81 in Poland, 0.63 in Greece, 0.58 in the Slovak Republic and 0.39 in Hungary This shows that there is diversity across Europe in either the perception of importance of the competence or the amount to which is it developed in each country.  It also suggests a lack of homogeneity in the results Ö a more serious consequence as is considered more in the discussion section B  The acadmic view of generic competences The 189 completed questionnaires returned by academics show they rate all but 8 of the generic competences to be of considerableé importance or stronger. The most important is Elementary computing skillsé with çCapacity for applying knowledge in practiceé and çProblem solvingé very close behind in joint second place. It is interesting to note that these top three are also the top three for all students. The least important competence is çUnderstanding of cultures and customs of other countriesé again in agreement with the views of all students There are statistically significant differences between the rated importance of 5 generic competences between the First and Second Cycle Degrees. In all 5 cases the mean at the Bachelor level is higher than that at the Master level indicating academics feel the competences are more important for study at the Bachelor level. The difference in çLeadershipé and Appreciation of diversity and multiculturalityé are both of medium effect size  t h e o t he r t h re e    D e c is i on m a ki ng    Interpersonal skillsé and çUnderstanding of cultures and customs of other countriesé are small Table 4 shows the rating of level of development of the generic competences for all academics.  There is an important difference between the ratings of level of development between academics and their students.  The academics consider technical aspects of their programmes to be being developed more than the general ones of çProblem solvingé, çCapacity to learné and çTeamworking Table 5 shows the gap between rated importance and level of development  TABLE IV  A LL ACADEMIC RATING OF THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENERIC COMPETENCES  Rank Generic competence Mean 1 Elementary computing sk ills 3.39 2 Basic general technical knowledge of the profession of your work area 3.21 3 Capacity for analysis and synthesis 3.14 4 Grounding in basic knowledge of the profession of your area 3.08 5 Capacity for applying knowledge in practice 3.06   28 Appreciation of et hical issues 2.36 29 International Relations and Collaborations 2.33 30 Leadership 2.31 31 Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries 2.15 32 Patents and Intellectual Property Rights 2.09  Academics consider knowledge of a second language to be the competence with the highest mismatch between rated importance and level of development. Interestingly this is the same as for students. Next is ability to work in an interdisciplinary team. This competence is ranked 17 th of all the generic competences with a mean of 3.22 Ö above considerableé. Academics clearly recognize the value of this competence in their students but perhaps do not have the opportunity to develop it within their own institutions. Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit are next highest in ègapê followed by planning and time managementé and çcapacity to adapt to new situationsé. Planning and time management is not ranked very high in the overall importance ranking \(19 th out of 32\t is an important general student study sk ill TABLE V  A LL ACADEMIC RATING OF THE  GAP  IN THE GENERIC COMPETENCES  Mean Rank Generic competence FCD SCD 1 Knowledge of a second language 0.71 0.68 2 Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team 0.66 0.72 3 Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 0.69 0.65 4 Planning and time management 0.65 0.62 5 Capacity to adapt to new situations 0.65 0.58    28 Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries 0.41 0.23 29 Basic general technical knowledge of the profession of your work area  0.40 0.45 30 Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality 0.37 0.14 31 Grounding in basic knowledge of the profession of your work area 0.28 0.32 32 Elementary computing sk ills 0.28 0.14  71 


The competences at the bottom of the list indicate the smallest gap between importance and level of development indicating that their development is closely matched to need Interestingly all gaps are positive indicating rated importance is higher than level of development \(on the same rating scale\ in all cases There is some variation in the ranking of the ègapê across Europe. For example, in Bulgaria the top 5 ranked gaps are  1  Planning and time management 2  Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team 3  Knowledge of a second language 4  Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 5  Oral and written communications in your native language  For French academics Capacity for generating new ideas creativity\ is top with çKnowledge of a second language second. Irish academics rank çCapacity to adapt to new situationsé top  C  The employer view of generic competences The 112 completed questionnaires returned by employers show a slightly different view to students and academics.  In the top 5 ranking of importance of the generic competences are Problem Solvingé, çTeam workingé and çCapacity for applying knowledge in practiceé in common with students and academics but also çConcern for qualityé and çCapacity to learné.  Both understandable from an industrial perspective Employers, like students rated çElementary computing skillsé first in terms of level of development followed by Capacity to learné, an encouraging result for HEIs.  çOral and written communications in your native languageé came third followed by çWill to succeedé and çBasic general technical knowledge of the profession of your work ar eaé.  Surprisingly Planning and time managementé can in the bottom 5 Ö this should be a concern for HEIs as most of us expect good demonstration of this competence in examination preparation individual and group projects and general assignment work Table 6 shows the employers rating of the ègapê in the generic competences Top of the list overall is çConcern for qualityé. This is dominated by a clear difference at the Masters level. At the Bachelor level the greatest gap is in çTeamworkingé. çPlanning and time managementé is second overall, again principally because of the Master level res ponses, it is ranked 6 th for Bachelor students. It is clear from the top few in the list where employers feel the academic programmes their graduate recruits have taken are falling short of their çneedé in the generic competences  TABLE VI  A LL EMPLOYER RATING OF THE  GAP  IN THE GENERIC COMPETENCES  Rank Generic competence Mean 1 Concern for quality 0.79 2 Planning and time management 0.75 3 Capacity for applying knowledge in practice 0.74 4 Problem solving 0.72 5 Team working 0.72   28 Research skills 0.33 29 Grounding in basic knowledge of the profession of your area 0.26 30 Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality 0.26 31 Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries 0.14 32 Elementary computing sk ills 0.09  Encouragingly at the bottom of the list there appears to be no issue with Elementary computing skills alt hough the academics who feel that this is not a core com ponent of their degree programme will gain little comfort from this outcome The other competences at the bottom of the Table 6 are generic competences employers feel are being developed in line with their rating of its importance There is variation in the way employers in different countries rate the gap between importance and level of development of the generic competences. The top ranked gap is   Bulgaria: çCapacity for applying knowledge in practiceé, çDecision makingé, çLeadershipé \(equal top   France: çCapacity to adapt to new situations Teamworkingé \(equal top   Germany: çPlanning and time management   Ireland: çTeamworking   Poland: çPlanning and time management   Slovak Republic: çAbility to work aut onomously IV  HOW THE GENERIC COMPETENCES GROUP  Factorial analysis was used to ègroupê the generic competences.  Across all the responses the 32 generic competences factored into 5 groups 1   Internationalisation Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries.é çAppreciation of ethical issues.é çAppreciation of diversity and multiculturality International relations and collaborationsé, çAbility to work in an international context 2   Entrepreneurship Patents and IPRé, çCreativity Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 3   Professional skills Grounding in basic knowledge of the professioné, çBasic general technical knowledge 72 


Capacity for analysis and synthesisé, çResearch skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills Leadershipé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çAbility to communicate with non-expertsé, çOral and written communications in native languageé, çCritical and self-critical capabilityé, çTeamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solvingé, çCapacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second languageé, çConcern for qualityé, çWill to succeedé, çElementary computing skillsé, çCapacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision makingé, çProject design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
