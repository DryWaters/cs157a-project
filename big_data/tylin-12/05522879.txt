The statistics-based association rule mining will be used as data preprocessing method. Assess model of power transformer equipments is created according to standards of Transformation Condition-Based Maintenance equipment which is carried out by State Power Grid on May 1, 2005, test data are treated with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, then a software platform that includes functionality to collect and store experimental data analyze data and trend, generate assessment report and put forward suggestions on repairing of transformer equipment status is built  Keywords-Condition-Based Maintenance \(CBM\; Data Mining; power transformer equipment; Fuzzy Theory I  I NTRODUCTION  Status monitor and diagnosis techniques are used by CBM to obtain the state of equipments and fault information, judge the device exception, forecast the development tendency of fault, and decide to repair the equipments before the occurrence happens  At present, internal condition-based maintenance is at a stalemate that making the maintenance decision in accordance with the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of equipments With the rapid development of power industrial and investment of various monitoring equipments, the data in power system database is exploding by the explosive increase of information technology, which makes it impossible to distinguish the supporting information for decision-making hidden in the database. Besides, traditional query and reporting tool are unable to meet the information needs of mining. It is imperative to introduce data mining technology into the analysis of power system. The combination of condition-based maintenance technology and data mining is also a general trend 2-3  The paper mainly researches assistant decision system of the electric power equipment CBM. The application research of data dig in the electric power equipment CBM also has been detailed analyzed. The system adopts the Condition-Based Maintenance technology based on data mining, combines the monitoring data of device and studies its database, such as analyzing and classifying the state characteristic quantities of devices. The system also reveals the deep information hidden in it and rule of gradient performance, discovers the early warning signs of the potential defects, uses fuzzy theory in order to make a judgment for serious degrees and development trends of the faults, and provides decision support 000\003 II  T HE S TRUCTURE OF S YSTEM  Data mining is the process of abstracting unaware, potential and useful information and knowledge from plentiful, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic data. Data mining is a popular technology supporting for DSS, which is mainly based on statistics, computer science, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and machine learning. It will make inductive reasoning and obtain the pattern of relationships between data objects by analyzing and dealing with initial data highly automatically. Those patterns of relationships reflect the inherent characteristics of data which is the higher abstraction level of the information included in the data The decision support system based on data mining combines the traditional DSS and data mining organically and extracts useful data and discovers useful knowledge effectively from the large data.

 tant decision system in the article reflects the integrated application of a variety of data mining methods 1, 3 A  Data pretreatment  The data source of this project includes basic technical data, operation data, and maintenance data. Basic technical data includes: drawings, specifications, Ex-factory data installation data and so on. The operation data includes operating conditions, defects records, accident records daily inspection records, online monitoring data, infrared monitoring data, and environmental conditions data. The maintenance data includes: preventive test data, overhaul and minor repairs records, flaw treatment records, accident treatment records, similar equipment accidents or defects and treatment experience and so on Not all parameters of power transformer equipments should be stored in the system to avoid wasting because of the mammoth database and uneasy management. We just need to store the state parameters intimately related to the operating condition of power transformer equipments These state parameters should be set through national standards and data mining methods such as the association rules and so on The data needed in the system is divided into three types: high-pressure test data, oil test data and operation data. Data encoding and data store of the test data in this article has been built, which lay a solid foundation for processing, analyzing and making use of the data B  Fuzzy processing 6  Fuzziness usually means the uncertainty of the definition of the concept and the understanding of linguistic meaning, for example, the uncertainty included in the normal state” and “dubious state” of power transformer equipments is fuzziness. Fuzziness provides a man-made compromise between qualitative and quantitative, subjective and objective, ambiguity and clarity. It can be used to study the state of power transformer equipments The fuzzy processing of electrical test data focuses on the processing of preventative test data of power transformer equipments, this includes: high-pressure test data on ontology, Casing high-pressure test data and oil test data on ontology of power transformer equipments. There is the fuzziness and uncertainty of the cause and phenomena of the malfunction and failure mechanism of power transformer equipments; it is difficult to describe the relationship between them using a simple diagnostic method though it is very hard to diagnose the cause of the malfunction and the real fault conditions. The fuzzy mathematics in this article analyzes quantitatively the obscure phenomenon of power transformer equipments combined with fuzzy language. The method is composed of the following steps 1  Construction of reviews sets of power transformer equipments The four states “normal”, “attention”, “abnormal” and serious” will be set as the reviews sets of power transformer equipment 2  Construction of factor sets of evaluation object of power transformer equipments All kinds of operation condition of power transformer equipments are set as the evaluation factors of the fuzzy evaluation. Such as: insulation resistance, absorption, polarization and index and so on 3  Determination of membership function Membership function in fuzzy sets range in [0, 1   therefore, the concept of relative deterioration degree is introduced to represent the degree of relative deterioration of the actual status compares to the fault condition  For the state variables which are the smaller the better such as dielectric Loss, the relative deterioration degree can be expressed as max max 1   c c c x f i     i c is the actual value max c is the maximum value when the equipment has a fault For the state variables which are the bigger the better such as polarization index, the relative deterioration degree can be expressed as min min 1   c c c x f i     min c is the attention value or the alert level of the equipment state parameters For the state variables which are the type of deviation such as capacitance, the relative deterioration degree can be expressed as

 mav mav i c c c x f    1    mav c  is the attention value of capacitance The quantitative data of all kinds of state variables are used by fuzzy distribution method in this article. The triangular membership function is simple in structure, and its result is nearly same with other more complex membership functions’. Therefore, the membership function “triangular and semi-trapezoidal combination” is adopt to establish the various membership function correspond to the different state levels. As shown in Figure 1  Figure 1  Combination of triangular and semi-trapezoid distribution function C  processing of historical data  1  Vertical comparison of test data of power transformer equipments  In order to ensure the credibility of the significant difference analysis, two conditions should be required a  6 or more sets of equipments, belong to the same type and the same batch, or are uniform in design craftsmanship and materials, and the previous test data does not differ greatly b  under the same experimental conditions, the same test is the best The analysis method of significant difference betw een the amounts of the state is as follows Set n \(n 000 5\ devices in the same family \(the same batch and the same manufacturer\.The average of the current experimental values for a state X is x. The sample bias is S \(diagnostic equipment are not included\ The current test value of diagnostic equipment is x, then the conditions of significant difference is  The degradation shows in decline of status value \(Insulation resistance ks x x    The degradation shows in increase of status value \(Dielectric loss ks x x    The degradation shows in deviate from the initial value Capacitance    ks x ks x x   002  k in the formulas above are selected according to n TABLE 1  Relationship between k and n  n 5 6 7 8 9 10 k 2.57 2.45 2.36 2.31 2.26 2.23 n 11 13 15 20 25 35 k 2.20 2.16 2.13 2.09 2.06 2.03 2  Horizontal comparison of test data of power transformer equipment  The application conditions are: there is a group of devices A, B and C, such as circuit breaker, isolating switch etc. There are also at least two tests of the value including the current test value, which were recorded as a1, b1, c1 the last test value\ and a2, b2, c2 \(the experimental values\. If we want to analyze whether the experimental values of A is normal, the value of F can be calculated according to equation \(1\. It is abnormal if F>=0.3  100  2 2  1  1 1  2 1      c b a c b a F 1  D  The overall structure of the system The deducted points of the substation equipments state are decided by its weight coefficient and the degree of degradation. The state of power transformer equipments should be determined by its deducted points. In order to meet the need of worksite and judge the status of power transformer equipments accurately for the staff of electric power test, fuzzy mathematics method is used to process the test data. At the same time, fuzzy three-ratio method is also used on the dissolved gas in oil for the fault diagnosis

Part of the test data of power transformer equipment are treated comprehensively. Operating parameter data’s points will be deducted according to the condition-based maintenance guidelines carried out by the state power grid in 2008 Finally, the equipment status assessment report is generated as shown in figure 3 and the corresponding suggestions and cycle of condition-based maintenance are put forward IV  C ONCLUSION  The fairly deep power system-related knowledge and theoretical guidance are called for in the data mining process in power system, which enable data mining more efficient through combining the DSS and data mining organically  This system classify and analyze the data using correlation method of data mining, assess the status of power transformer equipments properly and give a reasonable maintenance plan.

proles that only appear in the potentially corrupted dataset and stand out from others because of the values of both measures will be considered as malicious intruders Once these proles are completely removed from the dataset a new iteration of the process would start with the elapse of time In the Mobasher’s example Item6 was clearly identied as an attacker Thus according to Table I we just need to know which users voted for Item6 with a high score if a push attack is considered Attacker1-3 are the malicious users that interfere in the normal behaviour of the user-based recomendation system III E XPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS Several different experiments have been carried out to detect potential attacks over an user-based recommendation system With this purpose in mind the aforementioned variation of the G3PARM algorithm was executed using a specic rating-based dataset Moreover the whole approach proposed in Section II has been followed All the experiments used in this study have been performed on an Intel Core i7 machine with 12Gb main memory and running CentOS 5.4 The algorithm proposed has been written in Java using JCLEC a J a v a library for evolutionary computation In the following sections we describe the dataset used detail the experimental set-up and introduce a brief description of the attack proles injected for the experimentation Finally we show the results obtained by different experiments A D ata s et and experimenta ls et-up In our experiments we used the free available Jester dataset Anonymous Ratings from the online Jester Online Joke Recommender System 1  This dataset consists of 4.1 million continuous ratings of 100 jokes from 73,421 users Table V summarizes the conguration parameters used for the experimentation TABLE V E XPERIMENTATION SET UP  Parameter Value Population size 50 individuals Number of generations 100  012\012 0.9  015 0.2 Maximum number of derivations CFG 24 Auxiliary population size 30 individuals Condence threshold 0.9 Minimum suppport threshold 0.0005 Maximum suppport threshold 0.125   10   10 B Execution of the RARM a lg orithm In order to obtain a diverse set of association rules ve different executions of the G3PARM modied algorithm have been carried out with ve different seeds Once the G3PARM 1 Jester Collaborative Filtering Dataset http://goldberg.berkeley.edu jester-data algorithm reaches a certain number of generations 100 generations in our proposal individuals from the auxiliary population are returned As explained before this population comprises the best individuals i.e those that exceed a minimum threshold of condence and support and have a support value less than a maximum threshold Finally the set of rules obtained from the auxiliary population are normalized by using the post-processing step implemented in this G3PARM algorithm version Table VI shows the average support and condence of the rules obtained in each experiment The value   is the number of rules that compose the auxiliary population once the algorithm reaches the maximum number of generations TABLE VI A VERAGE RESULTS FOR EACH MEASURE PER EXECUTION Support Con“dence N Rules Experiment1 0.0340 0.9796 146 Experiment2 0.0324 0.9864 146 Experiment3 0.0431 0.9742 149 Experiment4 0.0312 0.9814 149 Experiment5 0.0499 0.9835 148 Average 0.0381 0.9810 147.6000 Finally we present some signicant rules obtained in this rst step of the intruder detection process described in this paper Ru l e1      012                  012      Ru l e1 norma l ized           012       012      Ru l e2          012  012               012   Ru l e2 norma l ized         012  012                012   These rules show the infrequent ratings of 100 different jokes Scores are bound from 10 i.e the user dislikes the item to 10 i.e the user likes the item C  Attack injection As we know the main goal of an attacker is to distort the normal behavior of a ltering recommender system in order to promote or demote a specic item Formally a proleinjection attack has a set of proles added to the system through an attacker with different ctitious user identities To 686 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s 


conceal the real intentions of an attacker it is necessary to rate items that are not the target item This paper is focused on the use of push attacks that consist in promoting an item selected by adding high ratings to the target item It also requires some ller rating in order to simulate a normal user behavior e.g rating the most popular items There are many ways to create a push attack 17  Random attack  This attack assigns the highest rating to the target item and random ratings to the ller items  Avera g e attack  In this attack a previously knowledge about the system is required The average rating of each item is assigned to each ller item In order to promote the target item the highest rating is assigned to this item  Bandwa g on attack  The attacker inserts some ller ratings like the random attack but also high rating in the most frequently rated items This model allows the association between the most visibility items and the target item  Se g ment attack  This attack tries to reduce the knowledge needed to create a push attack by pushing an item to a group of users with specic preferences Focusing on the average attack and in order to create this kind of attacks see Figure 4 a set of ller items    are randomly chosen and a random rating is generated in the domain 015            being the average rating for the item  and  being its standard deviation On the other hand the highest rating is assigned to the target item This process must be repeated in order to generate a set of attack proles the attack size The cardinality of the set      can also be different In our experiments we created six attacks with different  values over three items with a low number of highest rating joke58 joke74 and joke79 The attack size used in these experiments was 2500 that approximately represents the 10 of the dataset size Then every new attack prole is inserted into the dataset and a new dataset with an attack injection dataset is obtained  Filler items Target item Null items l i n-l-i n items I f I o I t Fig 4 Average attack schema D  D etection of s u s piciou s attacker s Once we have the dataset and a set of rare association rules we analyze the rating patterns For each experiment we obtain a subset of rules that have undergone a signicant change in some attributes higher than a user-dened threshold probability For these rules the 015\012 measure will indicate the current item attacked With a threshold probability of 80 more than 30 rules were obtained as shown in Table VII All of these rules present the item attacked in their expression with 92 or 100 of attack probability In this case no rules with a signicant change in a ller item have been found The values of the 015\012 measure are always higher than zero in the attacked items For the rest of attributes ller items less than zero values are obtained so the suspicious item the item with a high attack probability is really the attacked item TABLE VII N UMBER OF RULES WITH THE ATTACKED ITEM P  0.8 Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 3232323232 Joke74 3737373737 Joke79 3636363636 Using this threshold probability the number of ller items inserted in the dataset is not signicant because the number of rules obtained for each  value is the same With a high value of the threshold probability only the attacked item presenting a great change in the corrupted dataset will exceed this threshold because the ller items are inserted with a less frequency than the target item If we change the threshold probability to 50 some new rules are found with the item attacked Table VIII If the number of ller items increases   takes values over 50 there will be some ller items that will appear in the new dataset close to the frequency of the target item Thus these items can be confused with the items attacked Table IX shows the number of rules with a higher change than the threshold probability caused by the high appearance of ller items in the attack In these cases the ller items can be considered to be attacked items because their attack probability is higher than the real target item probability When this happens the 015\012 measure gives us the current inuence of the attack in the dataset For example one of the association rules obtained in our experiments has one ller item with a probability to be an attack of 50 and the target item of 20 Yet the inuence measures obtained were 0.006 for the ller item and 0.022 for the target item TABLE VIII N UMBER OF RULES WITH THE ITEM ATTACKED P  0.5 Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 4444444444 Joke74 3737373737 Joke79 3939393939 TABLE IX N UMBER OF RULES WITH FILLER ITEMS Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 0 0 0 51 265 Joke74 0 0 0 81 279 Joke79 0 0 0 143 359 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s 687 


IV C ONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK This position paper has shown a novel proposal for the detection of malicious attack injections in user-based recommendation systems A core step in this process consists in mining infrequent combinations of user ratings on items e.g movies books music and so on With this purpose we have introduced a variation of our previous algorithm G3PARM that is specially devoted to rare association rule mining Since G3PARM is an evolutionary algorithm that uses G3P we have taken advantage of some important characteristics aforementioned such as its adaptability to the scope of application as well as its scalability which allows it to face up to large datasets comprising a great deal of attributes or items Precisely this latter point is an usual shortcoming of current attack detection proposals The attack probability   and the 015\012 measure used in the analysis of the rating patterns allows us to extract the suspicious attacked items state the real inuence of these items and nally extract the target item that the attacker promoted In our experiments both the attacked items and some ller items were catalogued as suspicious but the ller items are discarded later thanks to the inuence measure As a future work we plan to test different types of attacks because CRD are susceptible to a wide range of attacks In this respect we will be able to prove our new detection process in more complex attack injections like the bandwagon attack Although most of the current proposals analyzed datasets with attacks we also propose to explore how this method would react in non-simulated environments i.e where the increment of the dataset presents both usual rating proles and attacker proles A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported by Spanish Research Projects P08-TIC-3720 TIN2008-06681-C06-03 and FEDER founds R EFERENCES  F  Zhang L Bai and F  Gao AU s er Tru s t-Ba s ed C o ll aborative Fi l terin g Recommendation A lg orithm  2009 pp 411–424  C W illiams B Mobasher  R  B urk e and R  Bhaumik D etectin g Pro l e Injection Attack s in C o ll aborative Fi l terin g A Cl a ss iÞcation-Ba s ed Approach  2007 pp 167–186  C W illiams B Mobasher  a nd R Burk e Defending Recommender Systems Detection of Prole Injection Attacks Service Oriented C omputin g and App l ication s  vol 1 no 3 pp 157–170 2007  S X W u and W  Banzhaf The use of computational intelligence in intrusion detection systems A review App l ied Soft C omputin g  vol 10 no 1 pp 1–35 2010  B Mobasher  R  B urk e R Bhaumik and C  W illiams T o w ard T rustworthy Recommender Systems An Analysis of Attack Models and Algorithm Robustness A C MTran s  Internet Techno l   vol 7 no 4 p 23 2007  V  Chandola A Banerjee and V  K umar   Anomaly Detection A Survey A C M C omput Surv  vol 41 no 3 pp 1–58 2009  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases in Proceedin gs of the 1993 A C M SIGMO D Internationa lC onference on Mana g ement of D ata SIGMO D 93  Washington D.C 1993 pp 207–216  C Bor gelt Ef cient Implementations of Apriori and Eclat  i n 1 s t Work s hop on Frequent Item s et Minin g Imp l ementation s FIMIÕ03  Melbourne Florida USA 2003  F  Bodon A T i re-based APRIORI Implementation for Mining Frequent Item Sequences in 1 s t Internationa l Work s hop on Open Source D ata Minin g  Frequent Pattern Minin g Imp l ementation  2005 pp 56–65  J Han J Pei Y  Y i n and R Mao Mining Frequent P atterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach D ata Minin g and Know l ed g e D i s cover y  vol 8 pp 53–87 2004  J M Luna J R Romero and S V entura G3P ARM A Grammar Guided Genetic Programming Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in IEEE Wor l d C on g re ss on C omputationa l Inte ll i g ence W CC I 2010  Barcelona Spain 2010 pp 2586–2593  Y  K o h a nd N Rountree Findin g Sporadic Ru l e s U s in g Apriori-Inver s e  2005 pp 97–106  L Szathmary  A  N apoli and P  V altche v  T o w ards Rare Itemset Mining in 19th IEEE Internationa lC onference on Too ls with ArtiÞcia l Inte ll i g ence I C TAI 07  vol 1 2007 pp 305–312  L T r oiano G Scibelli and C Birtolo  A Fast Algorithm for Mining Rare Itemsets in Proceedin gs of the Ninth Int l  C onference on Inte ll ig ent S ys tem sD e s i g n and App l ication s  2009 pp 1149–1155  J R K o za Genetic Pro g rammin g  On the Pro g rammin g of C omputer s b y Mean s of Natura l Se l ection  C omp l ex Adaptive S ys tem s  TheMIT Press December 1992  S V e ntura C Romero A Zafra J Delgado and C Herv  as J C LE C  a Framework for Evo l utionar yC omputation  ser Soft Computing Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2007 vol 12 pp 381–392  S Lam and J  Riedl Shilling recommender systems for fun and prot  in Proceedin gs of the 13th Internationa l WWW C onference NewYork NY 2004 688 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
