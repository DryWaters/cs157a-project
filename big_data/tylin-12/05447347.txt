The goal of frequent itemset mining is to discover all the itemsets whose supports in the database exceed a userspeci  ed threshold. However, it often generates a large number of candidate itemset,which reduce the e 001\033 ectiveness of the mining algo rithms. Constraint-based mining enables users to provide restraints on mining their interested association rules and can greatly improve the e 001\034 ciency of mining tasks In this paper, we propose  a fast constraint-based algorithm for mining maximal frequent itemsets.The algorithm introduces item-constraint s into the Eclat algorithm, and adopts itemset extension pruning strategy to prun search sp ace. Empi rical evaluation showed that the algorithm is very e 001\033 ective and can solve the lack of constrained frequent itemsets algorithm in mining long pattern and intensive database Keywords Association rules 000\036 Maximal frequent itemsets constrained-based mining   I  I NTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is to discover all association rules among itemsets in a given database, where the supports and con  dences of these association rules must satisfy the userspeci  ed minimum support and minimum con  dence. This task  is usually decomposed into two steps: \(1\erate all itemsets that exceed the minimum support; \(2\onstruct all association rules that satisfy minimum con  dence from the frequent itemsets in step one In a variety of data mining problems, mining frequent item is the basic process but also a key step  Frequent item min ing has been extensively used in association rule mining 2  3  4  The goal of frequent itemset mining is to discover all the item- sets whose supports in the database exceed a user-speci  ed threshold. However, frequent itemset mining algorithms often generate plenty of frequent itemsets and rules.In these associa tion rules, often only a small part of the user concerned. Users can not very intuitive to find that the focus of mining and valuable rule has been overshadowed by a large number of invalidrule But for a frequent itemsets that length is L, there are 2-1 L  frequent subset. When L is very large, mining all the frequent itemsets is much difficult. As the maximal frequent itemsets has been implied all the frequent itemsets, and many data min ing applications need only mining maximum frequent itemsets instead of mining all the frequent itemsets, So which in recent years, many people have embarked on researching for maxim al frequent itemsets mining 5  6  At present mining maximum frequent itemsets algorithm is mainly based on improved algorithm for Apriori 7 or FPgrowth  algorithm. Apriori-based algorithms need to repeat edly scan data sets, and will produce a large number of candi date item set. Although the FP-growth algorithms do not gen erate candidates, but the FP-tree construction and traversal affecting the efficiency of FP-growth algorithm is the bottle neck. To improve the e 001\033 ectiveness and e 001\034 ciency of mining tasks, constraint-based mining enables users to concentrate on mining their interested association rules instead of the complete set of association rules  this paper presents a fast constraint-based algorithm for mining maximal frequent item sets,which is based on Eclat algorithm and can solve the lack of constrained frequent itemsets algorithm in mining long pattern and intensive database The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, a brief description about Edat algorithm and constr ained association rule mining theory is explained. The next section introduces our new detailed method. Following section we conduct a series of experiments to show the e 001\034 ciency and scalability of our proposed algorithms.

Second, the search space \(concept lattice\ is divided into smaller sub-spacethe\(sub-concept lattice\by use of the equivalence relations,and each sub-concept lattice generates independently frequent itemsets. It scans the database only two times and calculate the support by use of cross-operation which has achieved good results in practice B  Constrained association rule mining theory Many constraint-based frequent itemset discovery techni ques have been proposed recently for various constraint mod els. These constraints include the types of knowledge constra ints, data constraints, dimension / level constraints, interests degree constraints and rule-bound, etc. Depending on the app lication of the actual requirements, the most useful constraints is item constraint, that is, mining the maximum frequents that contain a project \(or contain a number of items\ constraints in frequent itemset mining were  rst discussed in Srikant et al. \(1997\, which considered the problem of integrating constraints that are Boolean expressions over the presence or absence of items into the association rule discovery algorithms De  nition 1 A constraint B is a predicate on the powerset of the  set of items I i.e B  2 I 001\027 true, false}. An itemset X  satis  es a constraint B if and only if B\(X\ true. The comple te  set of itemsets satisfying a constraint B is  B SAT I X I  X satisfying B 000\036\000  De  nition 2 For item sets X I 000 X  support degree expresses as X_support, and min_support as a given minimum support If X._support 000p min_support,and Y_support 000\035 min_support for any Y X 000 en claimed X was the largest frequent item set Note that if any superset of a frequent X is infrequent then the X is maximum frequent De  nition 3 For the maximum frequent itemsets X I 000 if X satisfy the constraint B, then X is constrained maximum frequ ent itemsets Theorem 1 For any item set X 000 I, if X satisfy the constraints B then any superset Y of X must satisfy the constraints B Proof Since X satisfy the constraints B there exists j B 001\031 B j=1,2 001\002 n\akes j BX 000 That is, any superset of X contains j B Therefore, theorem 1 is proved Corollary 1 For any frequent item set constraints X 000 I, there is constrained maximum frequent itemset Y 000 X Note that any constrained-frequent itemset must be a sub set of the largest frequent itemsets.So,founding frequent item sets can be turned into the problem that discover constrained maximum frequent itemset To introduce constraint into the Eclat algorithm, it is nec essary to sort items of the database. After introduction of con straints, we will need to re-sort for the items when mining B’maximal frequent itemsets that satisfy constraint i B.First order B: when i B has i ij 000 put i ij 000 on the front of the conjunc tion items i B Then sort the items of I: put the m projects in i B as m items of I in front. The enumeration tree of diction ary sequence subset sort the items by dictionary order way.So it ensure that each itemset expression is the only ,which  de fine the node hierarchical-expansion structure using inclusion relationa between the subsets Pruning strategy 000\035 Application IEP algorithm\(Itemset Ext ension Pruning Strategy 10 prun search space,which can im prove the algorithm performance Theorem 2 Assume that B is a item constraint.The maximal frequent itemsets can be obtained to satisfy the constraints ,by solving maximal frequent itemsets that satisfy each disjunction item  Theorem 3 The maximal frequent itemsets,which meet every item B, must be in the equivalence class of the disjunctive item.If B has m disjunctive items, maximal frequent itemsets must be in topmost equivalence class of P\(I m  Theorem 2 and theorem 3 tells us that the item constraint B can be broken down to the corresponding equivalence class according to disjunctive items,which is the core of dealing with constraints. The sorting operation ensure that B i of B  dis junction stands in the presence of the equivalence classes. So through these major equivalence constrainting, the efficiency of algorithm can be greatly improved. Eclat adopts by topdown enumeration algorithm, and finds out all the equivalence class by recur to enumerate intersection of each atomitem Because we just want to mine the maximal frequent itemsets that satisfing the constraint, so we will discuss how to divide the equivalence classes so that improve the mining speed Comparing with the previously proposed methods, the more representative is Separate algorithm 1 which generates less candidate sets. In Separate algorithm, the idea of Apriori algorithm is used to generates candidate sets and frequent item sets layer by layer. As the constraints of accession, Separate can directly generate candidate sets that meet the constraints B. According to the different constraint length,algorithm can gen- erate effectively the frequent itemsets of satisfy user specified constraints.However,due to Separate algorithm follows the conceptual framework of Apriori algorithm therefore, it foll- owed the Apriori algorithm disadvantages.That is, it not only generates a large of frequent itemsets but also repeatedly scan the database;As stated in L 11 L Separate algorithm also has important shortcomings that does’t prune candidate sets and produces a lot of useless calculations III  M INING A LGORITHM  In this section, we propose Eclat_FCMFS algorithm to obtain maximum frequent itemsets  that satisfy the constraint B.On the specific constraints,the algorithm uses depth-first str

In the function Eclat_FCMFS i B it cuts invalid candidate pattern and comes into directly the next cycle when the pruning condition 17\, 18\ is satisfied. Thus it can  save greatly computing time;When the condition 20\, 21 is satisfied, it will be merged into the next one set to dynamic ally reduce the number of cycles; When the condition 24\ is satisfied, the consolidation-item R will replace the original t Y  and thereby accelerating speed of item consolidation and saving  computing tim. Furthermore, since the algorithm based on the Eclat algorithm  we only need to access the database can be twice, which greatly saves the time spent on accessing the database with regard to the time spent  IV  E XPERIMENTS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  Separate algorithm is one of more efficient and classic algorithms in the current mining frequent itemsets . In order to illustrate the performance of the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm,we compare it with the Separate algorithm We conducted some experiments to evaluate e 001\034 ciency of our algorithms. These algorithms were implemented using C++ language and tested on a PC with a single Intel Pentium IV 80G processor and 512MB main memory using the Windows XP operating system. Experimental data sets using literature data on method of synthesis of [5  We use V25F20 T50KN1KL100 to represent the default setting where the average size of the transactions is 25, the average size of the maximal potentially frequent itemsets is 20, the number of transactions is 50K, the number of items is 1K, and  the number of maximal potentially frequent itemsets is 100 To test the e 001\033 ect of a constraint on mining frequent item sets, the selectivity 000M of a constraint B is de  ned as follow Number of frequent itemsets not satisfying Number of frequent itemsets B 000M 000\036  Consequently, a constraint with 0% selectivity means every frequent itemset satis  es the constraint, while with100 selectivity means every frequent itemset violates the constraint A  Mining time-varying conditions as the number of transactions increasing In the  rst experiment, we wanted to investigate how run time changes as the transaction size vary. Therefore, we  rst set the minimum con  dence at 0.5%, the constraint 000\003 selective bind to take 000M 20% and 000M 80% respectively. It is obvious from Fig.1 that the run time of both  Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithms increases as the number of transactions increases, and the excavation time is linear growth in each case.We can also observe that when 001 20% ,Eclat_FCMFS

  algorithm for mining time is more longer than that when 001  80%;When 001 20%, mining time of Eclat_FCMFS algo rithm 002 is close to the  that of Separate algorithms. When 001  80%, Eclat_FCMFS algorithm for mining time is far less than that of  Separate algorithm. This is because that Separate algo rithm is based on the idea of Apriori algorithm. When the con straint selectivity is large, Separate algorithm requires contin uous access to the database and produces a large number of candidate sets, which greatly increased the time of excavation Eclat_FCMFS algorithm in these two areas significantly re duced the excavation time through the use of effective strate gies 000\\000\003\000\(\000I\000I\000H\000F\000W\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000W\000K\000H\000\003\000Q\000X\000P\000E\000H\000U\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000W\000U\000D\000Q\000V\000D\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000V 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 20K 40K 60K 80K 100K 0001\000X\000P\000E\000H\000U\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000W\000U\000D\000Q\000V\000D\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\000L\000Q\000\003\000G\000D\000W\000D\000E\000D\000V\000H 0000\000L\000Q\000L\000Q\000J\000\003\000W\000L\000P\000H\000\013\000V\000\014 0006\000H\000S\000D\000U\000D\000W\000H\000\013\000\025\000\023\000\010\000\014 000\(\000F\000O\000D\000W\000B\000\\000\025\000\023\000\010\000\014 0006\000H\000S\000D\000U\000D\000W\000H\000\013\000\033\000\023\000\010\000\014 000\(\000F\000O\000D\000W\000B\000\\000\033\000\023\000\010\000\014  B  Mining time-varying as the constraint selectivity increasing The  minimum support sets 0.5%.  Fig. 2 shows how  the Eclat_FCMFS and Separate  algorithms changes as the constr aint selectivity increases from 0% to100%. We can see that the execution time of the Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithm decreases as the constraint selectivity increases. But when 000M  15%, Eclat_FCMFS mining algorithm is 40-50% times faster than the Separate algorithms. As the constraint selectivity incr eases,  i.e.,  more frequent itemsets violate the constraint,  the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm can prune more search space When the constraint selectivity is smaller, Eclat_FCMFS mining time is far less than the Separate algorithm.With the increase in selective constraint, Separate mining time  gradua lly approximate the mining time of Eclat_FCMFS algori thm.This is due to the number of mining frequent itemsets will be subsequently increased with decrease of the constraint, then it will dig out a large number of long frequent pattern. Therefore, for the database-intensive digging, the performance of the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm is better than Separate algorithm C  Mining time-varying conditions as the minimum support threshold In this section, we wanted to investigate how run time changes as the minimum support value. The experiments are performed over the dataset with the default settings and the constraint selectivity 000M 20% and 000M 80% respectively. Fig.3 shows how the Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithms chan ges as the minimum support threshold increases from 0.25 to 2%.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
