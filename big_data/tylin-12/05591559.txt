This work gives the neuroradiologist a second option for the easy identification of tumor cells from the brain image. The important data mining concept that has been included in the proposed work consists of pre-processing of the CTScan brain image. The method used for pre-processing includes Shape priori technique. The feature selection from the brain image has been done using the association rule mining. The rules generated for extracted features are stored in the transactional database have been classified using the data mining concept called Decision Tree Classification. The combination of both the association rule mining and the decision tree classification gives the high degree of accuracy and efficiency for the proposed system Keywords Data mining, Image mining, Shape priori algorithm Association Rule Mining, Decision Tree Classification I I NTRODUCTION Medical diagnoses of brain tumor from the brain tissues were very important in medical treatments of brain cancer. There exist many types of techniques for the detection of brain tumor 1 f o r  in s tan ce co n v e n ti o n al r a d i o l o g y  u ltr as o n o g r ap h y   magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography and etc Among the various types of screening procedures, computer aided position Emission tomography provides the cost effective lass radiation and accurate identification of brain tumor The process of diagnosing a number of CT-Scan images after analysis becomes tiresome and more consequently susceptible to errors. Hence a computer aided diagnosis \(CAD\ system can be used to assists the physician’s as a second option to reduce the mistakes and errors [2  Th u s  in med i c al ce n t e r s an d in  hospitals building CAD system is becoming of high important Pre-processing of images is an essential task in the field of object based motion estimation, medical image processing computer vision, etc. In order to analyze the object properties 978-1-4244-6589-7/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE Pre-processing techniques have been used t o isolate the desired object from the image [3  4    Th e m e d i cal  i m a g e p r eprocessing is a challenging problem. Its results are needed for the estimation of boundary of an object, classification of tissue abnormalities, shape analysis, contour detection and texture segmentation. Several diagnoses are based on the proper preprocessing of digitized image Feature selection is a classical problem in the field of statistics and also an important topic in machine learning which is mainly studied from the perspective of statistics and information processing. According to the mode of combining the learning algorithm, the existing feature selection strategies 5 can b e ma in l y ca t e g o r i z e d  in t o  th r ee g r o u p s  em b e d d e d  methods filter methods and wrapper methods 6  I n t h e  proposed work, a great effort to apply association rule mining techniques to solve feature selection problems, and attempt to produce a small size feature subtypes that is acceptable for classification tasks Decision tree have been a powerful and attractive tool in the field of classification, mainly because they produce easily interpretable and organized results. In general computationally efficient and capable of dealing with noisy data 7   8   I n th e  proposed paper section II gives the system description, section III describes the proposed system, section IV results and discussion and finally section V gives the conclusion and references II S YSTEM DESCRIPTION The proposed system consists of two main phases namely the training phase and the testing phases. The techniques that are conducted on these phases for image mining is pre-processing feature extraction, association rule mining and decision tree classification In the proposed work brain images were pre-processed using the pre-processing technique called Shape priori technique. The 


technique mainly includes the curve evolution and shape correction methods. The curve evolution method produces the features from the images and also the prior knowledge about the images. The shape correction technique includes the image correction and shape correction. The images that is preFig. 1 Overview of the proposed system Processed using the shape priori techniques has been extracted using the feature extraction method and the features are stored in the transactional database. The popular data mining technique used for calculating the frequent itemset generation is association rule mining \(ARM\. In the proposed system association rule mining method has been used to mine the rules for the features that are extracted from the pre-processed CTScan images Figure 1 gives the overview of proposed system III P ROPOSED SYSTEM A.   Pre-processing CT-scan brain images are noisy and inconsistent to interpret in their raw form. To produce a reliable representation of the brain images, pre-processing of the brain images has been needed There are two techniques involved in the pre-processing of brain images they are Noise Reduction Many brain images have existing artifacts like written labels that need to be eliminated Enhancement of images  Image enhancement improves the quality of the image. It improves the distinct feature in an image, by increasing the contrast range in the image Shape Priori In the proposed system the technique that has been used for pre-processing includes the Shape priori technique. The general idea of this method is to evolve a curve in the image in such a way that its final position corresponds to the segmentation of the shape in the algorithm. The curve evolution is driven by two terms; one used the features taken from the image while the other includes a priori knowledge about the shape of the curve which limits the space of possible solution. The flow of proposed segmentation algorithm is shown in the Figure 2. The initial estimation is obtained by roughly fitting the mean shape of the shape space which is represented by a set of equidistant sampled points \(control points\ into the pre-processed image.  The initial curve is iteratively deformed by two successive steps: image correction and shape correction The initial estimation is obtained by roughly fitting the mean shape of the shape space [9 w h ic h is  represented by  a set of equidistant sampled points \(control points\to the pre- processed image. The initial curve is iteratively deformed by two successive steps: image correction and shape correction.  The first step is related to the image and in this step, transformation of the curve towards the image data is achieved by allowing strong local deformation. Hence, a band around the initial estimation is formed by coordinate transformation [10  an d th i s p r o ces s i s ca l l e d  a s  n o r m a l  mapping This band restricts the use of the image information in the interested regions of this process Then the control points of the current curve are moved along the normal direction by a magnitude that depends on the image in the neighborhood band.  This displacement depends on weighted average of pixel properties along the normal to the current curve.  The weight takes into account the presence of bright regions roughly parallel to current curve. The second step is related to the knowledge about the shape in the algorithm. This prior shape knowledge is essential to interpolate the curve in those regions with insufficient data. The shape correction is obtained by using mean shape and statistics. This is an iterative algorithm and the stopping condition is based on the movement of the curve during evolution process. The stop condition test is performed after both image correction step for each iteration are completed  Ultrasound carotid artery Curve Evolution Terminating condition Normal Mapping Confidence Learning Image correction Shape correction Segmented output Training Phase Pre-processing Feature Extraction Transaction al database ARM Decision Tree Classification Testing Phase Pre-processing Feature Extraction ARM Diagnosis

ROI based CT image The algorithm is terminated only when the mean absolute difference between the control points of the current curve and previous iteration is less than one pixel by control point or when it reaches a fixed number of iterations B. Curve evolution Good initialization is needed to avoid local minima and to obtain early convergence. Figure 3 represents the original CTScan brain image. The right position, orientation and scale of the shape in the algorithm are identified in this step. Initially the region of interest \(ROI\ window is applied to eliminate the scanner artifacts such as the date, scale and time and anisotropic diffusion filter is used to eliminate the speckle noise in the interested region The Following steps have been employed in the curve Evolution 1 ROI 2 Image quality enhancement 3 Edge detection Then, Figure 4 represents the high-pass filter with very low cutoff frequency is used to compensate the slow brightness variations in the image. The high pass filter output is binarized using threshold value proportional to the gray level variance in the ROI. Inside the large regions of the binarized image, a seed point is fixed to define the initial position of the curve and is done by finding the first high intensity pixel from top, bottom left, and right edges of the ROI which is also represented in figure 5. Using this seed point and the mean value of the distances between the centers to first bright region in all the four directions, the contour of the curve is defined and hence the initial estimation of the shape is obtained C. Image correction Normal Mapping In order to deform the curve toward the data of the images, it is essential to permit strong local deformations of the curve. A band around the curve is formed to allow for deformations in the normal direction to the curve. This band formation is equivalent to the image information which is used by the experts when manually tracing the curves. It also restricts the use of the image information to the interested region in this process. This band formation process is defined as Normal Mapping \(NM\, dependent on a curve C and is also termed as coordinate transformation. The idea is to unroll the band around the curve in such a way that the horizontal coordinate  u is the arc length of the curve and the vertical coordinate v  is the distance to the curve. A point x,y in  the band is fixed in normal mapping space u,v with the vertical coordinate v is the distance from that point to the curve. The points in a vertical direction in NM are in the normal direction to the curve C in the image Learning the Confidence of the Image Information along the contour of the shape The regularity of contour [11 i s l e a r n e d by ob s e r v i ng t h e g r a y  level information in the neighborhood along the manually traced curves. For this, the normal mapping is applied to the curves which are marked using manual methods on the set of CT-Scan brain images. Then, the pixel-wise average of this set of images and their vertical gradients is calculated. They are called as mean NM image, and the mean NM gradient image Using these two values, weight function \(1\ is calculated F sc  u KG  I NM  u 0  I NM  u 0\\                  \(1 Where K = normalization factor G  Gaussian filter u arc length I NM mean normal mapping image  I NM mean normal mapping gradient image This function is used to modulate the confidence in the image information along the contour Image Correction In the image correction step, at iteration k, each control point of C k curve obtained at k th iteration\ is moved along the  


normal direction by a magnitude that depends on a weighted average of pixel properties in that direction. The weight takes into account the presence of bright regions roughly parallel to C k A band of width 2d around C k is mapped using the NM transformation and d represents the distance up to which the pixel details are taken for coordinate transformation. This NM transformed image is applied to a Gaussian filter in the horizontal direction and a derivative kernel in the vertical direction. These two operations are equivalent to a Gaussian filter in a direction parallel to the curve, and a derivative filter normal to the curve. The columns in the NM space must be moved up and down in such a way that the central horizontal line intersects the white horizontal regions as much as possible. The idea is that Ck must be attracted by the bright regions in the image, which correspond to the discontinuities in the tissue captured by the scanner This procedure allows important local deformations of in the normal direction. For each control point xi, yi f Ck \(that lies on the central horizontal line of the NM\ the new displacement” value v i d is estimated as a weighted mean of each point in that vertical line, points which lie on the region d to d. The weights combine the area of the connected component in which u,v lies, the length of the maximal horizontal segment in that connected component and a regularization term. The expression for the displacement is given in \(2       d j V j d d V i i j sc d V  A\(u  h\(u  V   A\(u V  h\(u  V  V  u F V d f  2 Where  global parameter calculated during learning process Fsc weighting factor  v  regularization term A ui,v  area of connected component h ui,v  Maximal horizontal segment in the connected component The control points of the current curve are moved by the displacement calculated by \(2\ and hence the image correction is performed D. Shape Correction Step Prior knowledge about the shape of the curve is included in the shape correction step and is essential to interpolate the curve in those regions with insufficient data. This step moves the current curve along the geodesic path towards the mean shape in the shape space. The shape space [10 i s f o r m u l at ed  b y  applying the manual segmentation to several CT-Scan brain images. In this method, shape is considered as a point in a given manifold and the distance between shapes is the length of geodesic path between corresponding points in the given manifold. Shape prior is the mean shape learned as Karcher mean of subset of manually marked data base.  Karcher mean minimizes the sum of squared geodesic distances between the mean shapes to each of the shape in the shape space. Shape correction is done by mean shape and statistics. Using mean shape, shape correction is done by finding the shape representation of the current curve and estimating the geodesic path between the mean shape and the current curve Then the correct scale, orientation and pos ition for the new curve are fixed by registering the image shape with the control points of the current curve. The terminating condition test is performed after the image correction and shape correction step. The algorithm is terminated only when either of the following conditions is satisfied: 1\ the mean absolute difference between the control points of the current curve and previous iteration is less than one pixel by control point 2 when it reaches a fixed number of iterations D. Feature Selection Using Association Rule Mining Association analysis is used for discovering the relationship of features in large size transactional database. In the proposed method a new feature selection method has been used and it integrates the theory of association analysis in image mining The general idea of the feature selection method is to find the features that are closely correlative with the keywords that represent the class attribute by mining association rules with its consequence as class attribute in the training data set The algorithm mainly includes three phases: generating association rules set, constructing feature set, and testing feature set. In the first stage, Apriori algorithm [12  1 3  h a s  been used to generate all association rules whose consequence is class attribute and lift is greater than 1. While applying Apriori, the parameter support and confidence are determined by the physicians. The second stage is to pick rules circularly from the rules set by certain strategy, as well as adding the attribute that appears in the antecedent of the picked rule into the feature set. The final feature set will be the result of feature selection. The last stage is a testing procedure in which all selected features are evaluated by learning algorithms 14  1 5   Th e p r o p o s ed f e a t u r e s e l ect i o n  a l g o r i th m  h a s b e en  detailed as follows Procedure of feature selection based on association rules 1 Discretize the numerical attributes in the training set T 2 Generate an association-rule set D by employing Apriori algorithm to the training set T 3 Clean up the feature set G 4 Select all the rules with consequences as the class attribute from the rule set D, then construct a new rule set D class using these rules 5 Calculate lift of each rule in D class and then obtain a new rule set D class by deleting the rules whose lifts are less than 1.0 


6 Sort D class on their length in ascending order first then on their confidence in descending order, and last on the support in descending order 7 Check the loop termination condition: if satisfied output the feature subset and exit. Otherwise, execute the procedure: pop the first rule d out of D class and then add all attribute that appear in the antecedent of d to G 8 Remove the instance covered by d from T 9 Recalculate the confidence and support of the left rules according to the processed training set T 10 Sort D class on the confidence in descending order first, then on the support in descending order. Jump to step 6 Algorithm for the feature selection algorithm based on association rules and its main related procedures has been given below. The function apriori \(line 3\ is to apply standard Apriori algorithm we mention above to generate the association rules. To ensure the success of rules generation, a procedure discretize \(line 2\ is needed to perform the act of making numerical attributes discrete before executing Apriori The procedure sort1 \(line 9\ and sort2 \(line 18\ are two multiple key sorting, the former is to sort rules on length in ascending order first, then on confidence in descending order and last on support in descending order; the latter is to sort rules on confidence in descending order first, then on support in descending order. The function pop \(line 13\ performs the act that getting the top rule out of the rule set. Procedure extract features in antecedent \(line 14\ executes returning a feature set that includes all attributes that appear in the antecedent of the rule in parameter list. Function filer train set line 16\ performs simple deletion work that canceling all instances covered by the transferred rule, and return the deleted instances set to main program.

Classification based on Decision Tree Decision trees have been used for classification and categorization. This tree is similar to a flow chart structure where an internal node represents a test on the attribute, and every branch represents an outcome of the test. The leaf node represents the ultimate class distribution Problem definition Given a set of pre-processed CT-Scan images \(1,...n\, where, n is the maximum number of image, the main significance are i To correctly classify the CT-Scan pre-processed images into distinct classes such as normal benign, and malignant ii To increase the accuracy of classification and compare it with the already existing algorithm Construction of Decision Tree Step 1 Data for the training set has been obtained by random sampling procedure, with bootstrap, where two-third of the data has been used for creating the tree Step 2 A random number of attribute are selected from the above feature set, and then identify the ones with most information gain to comprise each node Step 3 continue to work down the tree until no more nodes can be created due to information loss 


Step 4 Identify the error estimate by running the remaining one-third of dataset through the tree and compute the correctness Algorithm Decision tree classifier Decision classifier consists of a collection of individual tree classifier. The general concept has been given below 1 Select N the number of trees to grow, and m a number no larger then the number of variables 2 for i=1 to N Call Train set 3 Draw a bootstrap sample from the data, term those not in the bootstrap sample as out-of-bag data 4 Grow a random tree, where at each node the best set is chosen among m randomly selected variables. The tree is grown to a maximum size and it should not be pruned 5 Use the tree to predict out-of-bag data 6 In the end use the predictions on out-of-bag data to form majority votes 7 Prediction of test data is done by majority votes from predictions from the ensemble of trees By applying the concept of decision tree classifier a three class classifier to classify the transactional database objects as normal, benign and malignant IV R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION A Classification Figure 7. Represents segmented output image of shape prior technique created image which is segmented from binary output image \(figure 6 then Classification involves segregating the data into segments which are non-overlapping Any approach to classification assumes some knowledge about the data termed as training. Performance of classification assignment has been measured in terms of classification accuracy. The outcome of classification can be described as  True positive TP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j and is actually in it  False positive FP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  True negative TN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  False negative FN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually in it  The precision and recall are used to determine the accuracy of the classifier Fig. 6 Binary output image Fig.7. Segmented output image   FP TP TP Precision    3  FN TP TP Recall   4 B. Confusion Matrix The accuracy of the classification technique has been indicated using the confusion matrix. When the system contains s number of matrix, the confusion matrix is in the form of sxs matrix. If there exists any entry for example C j means it represents the number of rows assigned to a class C j instead of the classification C i The general form of the confusion matrix is given in the following table I. The proposed system consists of three classes for classification like Normal, Benign and Malignant. The confusion matrix that represents the association rule 3 under the decision tree classification is a 3x3 matrix. This association rule consists of 200 rules for instances means then 151 are normal, 27 are malignant and 22 are benign TABLE I GENERAL TWO CLASS CONFUSION MATRIX Human provision Category Yes No Yes TP FP Classifier provision No FN TN

Precision and Recall An important truth to be notices is that both the association rule mining and the decision tree classifier performs relatively well on the transactional database. Using the equation \(3\ and 4\ precision and recall values are computed for the data stored in the database. The following graph gives the precision and recall value for the proposed system compared with the neural network and associative classifier. Figure 8 represents the precision and recall graph D.

The new technique called Shape priori algorithm for pre-processing of images has given the efficient features to be stored in the transactional database. The feature selection using Association rule mining algorithm has given the best way of identifying the rule to be used for classification phase.
