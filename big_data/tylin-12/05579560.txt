This model applies to large fluctuations and more random forecast of original data. We have used determining state range based on time-series forecast and combined with Markov process to amend the value of fitting time series simulation, which will not bring about greater Markov forecast error, and the data got when such applications are mixed shows that the accuracy is better than a single use of time-series model. Table 4 also shows the support for the rule in the next three years on the rise. According to the median forecast and the probability of state which are proposed by AR-Markov model we can grasp the future change trends of support for dynamic association rule V  C ONCLUSIONS  This article is based on  reference 1 2  has put forward the concept of dynamic association rules, introduced the definition of Meta-association Rules for dynamic association rule, put forward a AR Markov model based mining method for meta-association rule of dynamic association rules. The mining method overcomes the shortcomings of big differences or uneven distribution in data got from static association rule mining algorithms. The results of the example in this paper shows that  the fitting accuracy and forecast accuracy of forecasts are much higher. This model is suitable to be used to mine meta-association rule when there is much historical and irregular data. We can more accurately grasp the trend of rules change through fitting the trend of rule changes and forecasting the future data, so that the dynamic association rule mining will get the more accurate results under the guidance of reasonable meta-association rule  R EFERENCES   LI U Jinfeng,Gang Rong:Mi ning Dy na m i c Association  Rules in Databases.In Proc.of international Conf. on Computational Intelligence and Security\(CIS`05 2005:668-695  m b e r  Data Mining 9 Concepts and Techniques 9 China Machine Press, 2007 9 147-183  HOU Qinfang,Dyna m i c  Data Processing: Time Series Anal jing: China  Meteorological Press,1991 9 1-433  m e Seri es Anal ysis [M].

the resulted optimal rule locates in the critical situation in the between. Note that Highest Modified ESE scheme has significantly better capacity than Highest MCS  scheme  C  Capacity Comparison of Diffe rent 2-Hop Relay Systems Fig. 9 shows the system capacity comparison with different association rules under rate fairness constraint. The system capacity with Highest  Modified  ESE  scheme in NT-RS is based on the different per-user rate in 1-hop and 2-hop links due to the fact that no common per-user rate exists in Fig. 8\(b In Fig. 9, the capacity improvement brought by the RS especially with MIMO in the relay link, is clearly visible. With any MS association rule, the highest capacity gain is achieved in NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed mode and MIMO used in the relay link. This is because the radio resources in the access link in this configuration has the highest reuse factor therefore the resources saved by MIMO in the relay link and then assigned to the access link can be used more fully. For example, with Highest MCS scheme system capacity is improved by 133% and 155% over the 1-hop baseline system in SISO and MIMO case, respectively Figure 9  System Capacity Comparison with Rate Fairness Constraint In T-RS Highest ESE scheme is optimal with slightly better system capacity than Highest MCS scheme While in NT-RS Highest Modified ESE scheme is suboptimal but has the system capacity close to the optimal rule; it is also always significantly better than Highest MCS scheme And Highest  Modified  ESE scheme requires only information relevant to MS itself and no iterations necessary in the computation. Hence it takes much less computation time compared with the optimal rule Highest  Modified  ESE scheme can be realized as follows for T-RS, the BS performs the scheduling function with the known access and relay links\222 qualities; while for NT-RS in distributed scheduling mode, to calculate the modified ESE, the BS and RSs need to exchange the information: access and relay links\222 qualities, access station type \(BS/RS\d the number of RSs per sector IV  S UMMARY  IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay task standard draft 16jD7 includes two mutually exclusive options: transparent relay systems \(T-RS\ and non-transparent time-division transmit and receive \(TTR\relay systems \(NT-RS\ A system design approach is proposed to compare these different options in term of capacity with rate fairness constraint. The effect of the number of RSs \(1 or 3\ and different antenna systems \(SISO or MIMO\n the BS\226RS link are considered. The simulation results show that NT-RS with 3 RSs per sector in distributed mode always achieves the highest system capacity, and that both 3 RSs per sector case and MIMO can improve the system capacity. Furthermore, two heuristic MS association rules Highest MCS  scheme and Highest  Modified  ESE  scheme are presented and compared with the formulated optimal rule that maximizes system capacity under user rate fairness constraint It is shown that Highest  Modified  ESE scheme is optimal in T-RS; and that as a suboptimal rule in NT-RS, it has the system capacity close to the optimal rule with much less information exchange and computation time R EFERENCES  1  IEEE Std 802.16e: \223Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems\224 with Amendment 2: \223Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands\224 and Corrigendum 1 2  IEEE Std 802.16j/D7: \223Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems, Multihop Relay Specification\224 3  223WiMAX System Evaluation Methodology\224, Version 1.0, WiMAX Forum, 01/30/2007 4  223Multi-hop Relay System Evaluation Methodology \(Channel Model and Performance Metric\\224, IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Working Group, IEEE 802.16j-06/013r3, 02/19/2007 5  Hui Zeng and Chenxi Zhu, \223System-Level Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Multi-hop 802.16j Systems\224, International Wireless Communications and Mobiel Computing Conference 2008 \(IWCMC 2008\ Crete Island, Greece, August 2008 6  Masato Okuda, Chenxi Zhu and Dorin Viorel, \223Multihop Relay Enabled WiMAX Networks: Overview & Benefits of IEEE Draft P802.16j Standard\224, Fujitsu Scientific & Technical Journal \(FSTJ\, special issue on \223Fujitsu\222s Mobile WiMAX Solutions\224, vol. 44, no. 3, July 2008 7  E.
