1 Fault-Pattern Discovery in Sequences of Voltage Sag Events Oscar Quiroga Joaquim Mel  endez and Sergio Herraiz Abstract A pattern discovery approach applied to sequences of voltage sags is proposed for fault modeling and failure prediction It is assumed the existence of some failures that are the result of accumulated stress produced by overcurrents during previous faults or the existence of pattern sequences produced by the reclosing of the protection system in presence of a fault So there may exist relationships between events Events registered in a real power distribution system are analyzed to search those fault patterns The events considered in this study are voltage 
sags generated by homopolar faults and registered by power quality monitors installed in the secondary of transformers in distribution substations The ordered list according to their time of ocurrence of events corresponds to a sequence and magnitude and duration are the attributes considered to describe the events The aim of this work is to nd patterns in a sequence of voltage sags that allow to recognize relationships between different types of sags occurred along time Index Terms Homopolar faults voltage sag pattern discovery sequence of events I I NTRODUCTION V OLTAGE sags are consequence of power systems operation load and capacitors switching transformer energiz 
ing etc and faults occurrence phase-to-ground or phase-tophase short-circuits These disturbances propagating through the network affects power quality and can cause serious effects on instruments machinery and production lines with the consequent nancial losses According to IEC a supply voltage dip is a sudden reduction in the supply voltage to a value between 90 and 1 of the declared voltage followed by a recovery between 10 milisecond and 1 minute later For the IEEE a voltage drop is only a voltage sag if thereduction is between 10 and 90 of the nominal voltage Since the motivation of this work is to assist maintenance planning providing tools to improve predictive strategies we focus only on those voltage sags produced by faults and failures A power system component failure  transformers 
insulators cables arresters etc affects directly the power continuity supply as well as the reliability of the affected component due to overcurrent and propagation of the voltage sags So consecutive shortcircuits in the same feeder can accelerate degradation of some components due to stress This work was supported by the research project Monitorizaci  on Inteligente de la Calidad de la Energ  a El  ectrica DPI2009-07891 funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci  on Spain and FEDER Oscar Quiroga received a PhD Grant 2010FI-B00663 funded by the Comissionat per a Universitats i Recerca del Departament dêInnovacio Universitats i Empresa of the Generalitat de Catalunya and also the European Social Fund

and duration Those tables can be used to model a network and predict the expected number of sags in a further given period  Dif ferent approaches ha v e been proposed in the literature for measuring and predicting the severity of voltage sags in a network assessing the compatibility of customer equipments as well as to predict future failures under a probabilistic approach 2 3 In all those approaches sags are treated as independent events i.e a random process However other works show that this independence is not always true This is for example the case of equipment failures caused by natural degradation or ageing ef fect of o v ercurrents 5 In 6 and adv anced monitoring and data recording equipment are used to document multiple failure phenomena related with gradual degradation of line devices 
In this paper we assume the existence of those sequences of dependent events directly related with system faults and/or failures Hence we consider a set of successive events registered in a single point of the network during a speciìc period of time as a sequence of events and the aim is to nd patterns in that sequence that represent evident relationships among events contained in that pattern With that aim we use basic algorithms for episodes discovery in event sequences  Those algorithms ha v e been widely used in other elds involving data inherently organized in a sequential nature such as alarms in a communications networks faults report logs from an assembly line in a manufacturing plant internet anomaly intrusion detection bio-medical data analysis stock 
trend prediction etc The paper is organized in three additional main sections Next section presents those pattern discovery algorithms to be used in sequences of events and the adaptation to analyze sequences of events Section III is focused on the results obtained when those algorithms are applied in a real data base of voltage sags gathered during three yeas in a distribution substation Finally the paper highlights main conclusions in section IV   978-1-4244-7245-1/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 


2 II P ATTERNS D ISCOVERY IN S EQUENCES OF V OLTAGE S AGS Under the consideration that several events in a sequence of events are related to each other and follow a predeìned pattern we propose the use of pattern discovery algorithms to nd those patterns This idea is supported by the following assumptions  Several events voltage sags originated in nearby points of the network can induce a failure in an aged element located in the path of the overcurrent between te transformer and the affected point  The fault location is related with the magnitude of the voltage sag caused by the fault Then sags with similarities in magnitude and duration occur in nearby region of the network  A component failure can cause multiples voltage sags by the actuation of the protection systems according to the reclosing settings  Many faults occur in a reduced number of points or areas of the line This happens for example with fault caused by tree/animal contacts or lighting induced events Therefore the goal is to nd automatically those predeìned patterns in sequences of events Multiple criteria can be considered for this purpose for example the frequency of apparition of those patterns A Description of the Proposed Solution In order to typify the events we use the intervals suggested in voltage sag density tables which is a common method for presenting large repositories or surveys of sags gathered during long periods of time more than one year according to their magnitude and duration There are several proposed tables b u t i n this w ork we ha v e used the interv als of the table recommended by the standard IEC-61000-2-8  F o r the magnitude the e v ents ha v e been split in nine categories deìned by the intervals 80%-90 70%-80 60%70 50%-60 40%-50 30%-40 20%-30 10%-20 and  10 For the duration the intervals are  0.1s 0.1s0.25s 0.25s-0.5s 0.5s-1s 1s-3s 3s-20s 20s-60s and 60s-180s Then we can have 72 different types of events one for each cell obtained when the previous segmentation of depth and duration is combined B Nomenclature Sequences and Episodes Two basic methods for pattern discovery in sequences were developed in T erminology and methods used in this w ork have been inherited from it and are described below Given a set E of event types an event is a pair  A t  where A is a type of event A  E  and t is its time of occurrence A sequence of events s can be expressed as  s T s T e   where s    A 1 t 1    A 2 t 2     An t n    Ai  E for all i 1   n  t i  t i 1 for all i 1   n  1  Ts is the beginning time of the sequence and Te is the ending time of the sequence being Ts  t i Te for all i 1   n  An episode is a collection of partially ordered events that occur together The events in an episode must occur close enough being the user who decides how close the events must be to be considered part of an episode This decision is made by deìning a sliding time window which is an event sequence w  w ts te   where ts<Te and te  T s  and w consists of pairs  A t  from s  where ts  t<te  The time span te  ts is the width of the window win  The objective is to nd within the sequences all the frequent episodes of a particular class There are several classes of episodes serial episodes when events occur strictly in that order in the sequence parallel episodes where the relative order of events in the sequence is not restricted and non-serial and non-parallel episodes which can be seen as a combination of serial and parallel episodes Fig 1 shows an example of an event sequence and the different classes of episodes represented as directed acyclic graphs The episodes are built iteratively starting from events and subepisodes which also must be frequent It is deìned that an episode  is a subepisode of  if the events of  also belong to  in the same partial order as  and the events of  are connected to all events of  that are not in   An example of this type can be seen in Fig 1 C Description of Methods for Episodes Discovery in Sequences In the rst method called WINEPI the frequenc y o r support  fr  of an episode is calculated as the number or fraction of windows where the episode occurs However this support over-estimates the ocurrence of an episode The user must specify the minimum frequency  min  fr  to consider an episode as frequent Basic algorithm to discover frequent serial episodes developped in is sho wed ne xt and basically consists in that the algorithm computes the collection of frequent episodes from a deìned class in this case only serial episodes The search starts from episodes with only one event frequent events Result of this rst step is equivalent to density tables Then in each new level the algorithm computes a collection of candidate episodes and then checks their frequency of occurrence from the event sequence The candidate generation is based on the lemma if an episode  is frequent in a sequence s  then all sub-episodes    are aso frequent So candidate episodes are built from the previously obtained frequent events The structure of the WINEPI algorithm is Input  A set E of event types an event sequence s over E a class  of episodes serial parallel or non-serial non-parallel a window width win  and a frequency threshold min fr  Output  The collection F of frequent episodes Method  1 Search the set C 1 of candidate episodes which have a length of 1 only one event 2 Initialise a counter l in 1 to count the length of the episodes 3 Open a while rutine to evaluate the candidate episodes and nd the frequent episodes until that do not have new candidate episodes  Make a routine to evaluate the frequency of the candidate episodes of length l    


3 Fig 1 Event sequence and classes of episode Note that the top of the gure show the sequence of events and in the bottom of the gure there are a example of the three classes of episode that can be found  Extract the frequent episodes of length l and identiìed as F l   Increase the counter l in 1 i.e make l  l 1   Make a routine for generates the candidates of length l  C l  from the frequent episodes of length l  1  This collection of candidates consists of episodes such that all subepisodes are frequent 4 For all l do output F l  The second method called MINEPI consists in looking at the instants of ocurrence of the episodes and the time relationships between those ocurrences instead using sliding windows and evaluate if an episode occurs in a window or not For each frequent episode the information about the locations of its minimal ocurrences  mo  is stored A minimal ocurrence  mo  of an episode  is an interval such that no proper subwindow contains the episode  e.g in the Fig 1 episode  E  has mo frecuency or support 3 interval 5  5  interval 35  35  and interval 75  75  while episode  E F  has mo frecuency or support 2 interval 5  10  and interval 35  40  D Formulation of Association Rules to Describe the FaultPattern Association rules describe the connections between events in a sequence They are obtained from frequent episodes but especiìcally from the frequent episodes called episodes rule  An episode rule is an implication of the form     where  is and subepisode of   The fraction fr    f r    is the conìdence of the rule  conf  and can be interpreted as the conditional probability that the entire episode  occurred in a window if a subepisode  has occurred in it For instance if the episode  showed in Fig 1 is a subepisode of   and  occurs in 5  of windows i.e fr     5 and  occurs in 4 of windows i.e fr     4 it can be estimated that after appearing events A and B in a window there is a possibility of 0.8 to obtain the event C in the same window III M AIN R ESULTS The results obtained applying the proposed methodology are presented in this section Here the WINEPI method is used for frequent pattern discovery This algorithm has the beneìt of assigning a conìdence index to the frequent episodes that allow to interpret them in terms of a probability of occurrence Fig 2 Voltage sag density chart Each cell represents a different type of voltage sag according to the table recommended by the standard IEC-610002-8 A Dataset Description Voltage sags caused by single-phase faults homopolar faults in the distribution system have been considered in this study Events have been registered in the secondary of a power distribution transformers 25kV over three years by the utility 1 using a power quality monitor A substation with a large number of events registered have been considered in the study Fig 2 shows the corresponding voltage sag density chart build according to the standard IEC-61000-2-8 Fig 2 contains a total of 527 voltage spread in columns where each cell in the gure represents a different type of event classiìed according to duration and magnitude and the height of each bar indicates the number of sags in each cell registered during the three years Table I exempliìes the representation of those events sorted according to the time Each event has three main attributes time is the occurren date of the event timestamp duration is the time that the voltage sags remains in the system according to the voltage sag deìnition magnitude corresponds to the maximum voltage drop during the event expressed as a percentage of the nominal voltage rms value B Frequent Episodes in a Sequence of Voltage Sags From the time duration and magnitude of each event we applied WINEPI algorithm to nd frequent episodes under the next two principal thesis a actuation of reclosers in presence of a fault will produce short-time episodes associated to the reclosing settings b shortcircuits can cause over-stress and degradation in components connected between the shorticircuit and the transformer 1 ENDESA DISTRIBUCION

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
