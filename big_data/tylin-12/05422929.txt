Frequent itemsets are the itemsets that appear in a data set frequently. Finding such frequent itemsets plays an essential role in mining associations, correlations, and many other interesting relationships among itemsets in transactional database. In this paper an algorithm, SAR \(Strong Association Rule\, is designed and implemented to check whether an Association Rule \(AR\ is strong enough or not. Apriori algorithm is also implemented to generate Frequent k-itemsets.

Finding such frequent itemsets plays an essential role in mining associations, correlations, and many other interesting relationships among itemsets in transactional and relational databases. Frequent Itemset mining is a core DM task. It has an elegantly simple problem statement: to find the set of all subsets of items that frequently occur together in database records or transactions. Although this task has a simple statement, it is CPU and input/output I/O\ intensive, mainly because the large amount of itemsets that are typically generated and large size of the datasets involved in the process[2,4,5  Mining the Association rules from the frequent itemsets requires a transactional database which can be a real transactional data base of any retail industry or can be a synthetic version generated by a tool. Synthetic Data Set generated by a tool can server a fundamental requirement for experimenting with the DM concepts and mining the Association rules from the frequent itemsets. Newly designed algorithms can be experimented and tested on such synthetic data sets and then the concepts can be implemented on a real data set [8    This paper presents an designed and implemented algorithm, SAR \(Strong Association Rule\, to check whether an Association Rule \(AR\ is strong enough or not. Apriori algorithm is also implemented to generate Frequent k-itemsets A Binary Transactional Dataset [8 is u s ed f o r im plem en ti n g  the algorithm in java language Rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Agrawal and R. Srikant [6 o r  mining frequent itemsets for generating boolean association rules. Apriori exploits the basic functionality of a frequent itemset: all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent Starting with singleton itemsets, Apriori computes their supports by scanning the database, and filters out frequent itemsets. At the end of each iteration, only itemsets whose immediate subsets are all frequent at the current iteration are considered at the next iteration We have also implemented Apriori algorithm in java language. Figure 1 shows the block architecture of the Apriori implementation. Transactional Data Set \(TDS\ contains items purchased per transaction basis. Candidate-1 Itemset Generator generates Candidate-1 itemset with support count. Frequent-1 Itemset Generator prunes Candidate-1 itemset with the constraints of given minimum threshold support count, i.e min_sup and generates Frequent-1 itemset which also is 2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference 343

If any of subset is not frequent in previous list \(Prior Knowledge from AFIR\d a resultant Candidate Itemset is generated for that iteration which is then pruned by Frequent Itemset Generator for generating Frequent Itemset List with the constraints of min_sup. This list is stacked to AFIR and also given to JOINER for the next iteration.

locate    s conditional PLMS-tree in the mining of sequence     s super-patterns. In line 7 through 9, we examine the mps of each node n and record their minimum mps  This value will be used in next step In line 12 through line 18, secondly, we generate candidate patterns and output sequential patterns according to each item  s icount  Three conditions may occur here. The first is that the icount satisfies MIS   This sequence is directly appended to the sequential patterns set. The second is that the icount doesn  t satisfy MIS  t satisfies mps That is, the sequence is currently not a sequential pattern, but its super-pattern \(i.e appending suffix in the sequence\ has possibility to be Therefore, both two conditions have to keep growing and recursively call procedure MSCP-growth for further examining their super-patterns. The third is that the count of sequence doesn  t satisfy both MIS  nd mps It means that any superpattern of the sequence  will never be a sequential pattern The procedure will terminate while the root set becomes empty We use the constructed PLMS-tree in Fig.12 to explain the mining process in detail. At first, the RS is root and we trace all nodes belong to the first item e in HT According to the nlink of item e from HT  we find \(_ e 1:11111001 n 1 at first, the position code shows that n 1 is a descent node of RS and n 1 is not recounted in the same branch n 1  icount will be add into icount since n 1 does not have any child node, no node will be joined into nRS According to the nlink in \(_ e 1:11111001\ the next node \(_ e 2:101 n 2 will be found n 2 is a descent node of root and n 2 is not recounted n 2  icount will be added into icount  n 2 also has a child node \(_ c 2:1011 that can be joined into the nRS to be a new root set if we need to growth this pattern. And the next node \(_ e 1:10111011\ is recounted so the node count of this node will not be added into icount  Since the icount of item e is 60% which reaches the candidate growth condition we mentioned before, we use the nRS and e as a candidate pattern to generate new patterns. Pattern e also reaches the threshold of sequential pattern, i.e. MIS e and can be joined into the sequential patterns set. The second step uses the node in the nRS _ c 2:1011\, as the new root set of conditional tree to growth new pattern\(s\. According to HT the icount of first item e rooted by \(_ c 2:1011 is 20%, which does not reach the candidate growth condition. The icount of second item c in HT rooted by \(_ c 2:1011\ is 40%, which reaches the condition to growth new candidate patterns, so we use the child nodes of _ c 2:1011 _ a 1:10111\nd \(_ b 1:10111 as nRS to generate new candidate patterns. This pattern also larger than MIS ec  which means it can be joined into the sequential patterns set The complete sequential patterns set with beginning item e can be generated by repeating these steps The reason we use the mps value and candidate growth will show in following example. We trace the item b now, the icount of item b is 100% which reaches the condition to generate new candidate and the threshold to be joined into the sequential patterns set. As the tracing step goes, we have the icount of item d 60% in the suffix tree of pattern b it reaches the mps value=30%, which is the second condition to candidate growth we mentioned before, and it means that this pattern still has possibility to be part of sequential pattern. Noted that it doesn  treach MIS bd 65%, which means it is not a sequential pattern. In the next candidate growth step, we have item e with icount 40% which reaches the MIS bde 30%, pattern bde  can be joined into the sequential patterns set. We can see that an infrequent patternês super set become frequent pattern in this case, that is why we need to consider about the mps value The other sequential patterns which are started from other items are generated in the same way. Finally, we can have the complete sequential patterns with MMS by MSCP-growth algorithm V C ONCLUTION In this study, we first address the rare item problem in the mining of sequential patterns. To generate more interesting patterns, we extend the concept of MMS on sequential pattern mining and propose an algorithm, named MSCP growth, to discover complete set of sequential pattern with MMS In experimental study, we will compare three well-known traditional methods, including GSP, PrefixSpan and PLWAPtree with MSCP-growth using several synthetic datasets as well as real-life datasets Some r esearch directions are briefly discussed. First, users may have to tune items  supports many times while discovering useful patterns. Instead of restarting the whole mining process, it is valuable if a support tuning mechanism can be developed. Second, the concept of MMS can be further applied to cons traint-based sequential pattern mining, such as time constraints or duration constraints A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under the Grant NSC 982410-H-194-054 R EFERENCES 1 Y  H Hu and Y L  C h en   M ini ng a s s o c i at i o n ru les w i t h m u lt ip le minimum supports: a new mining algorithm and a support tuning mechanism Decision Support Systems vol. 42, is. 1 pp.1-24, 2006 2 R  A g ra w a l a n d R Srik ant   M in in g s e qu en ti a l pa tt ern s    Data Engineering \(ICDEê95  Taipei, Taiwan, Mar, 1995, pp.3-14 3 J.
