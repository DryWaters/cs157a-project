Mining Valid Association Rules in Incomplete Information Systems  Lili Wang Department of Computer Science and Technology Dezhou University Dezhou, China wlilina@126.com Guangjun Yang Mechanical Electronic Engineering Department Dezhou University Dezhou, China wlilina@126.com   Abstract Extracting the association rules is an important research topic among the various data mining problems. Based on the rough set theory which is a powerful tool in dealing with incompleteness and uncertainty, an algorithm to mine association rules in incomple te information systems is presented. In the new algorithm, the support and confidence are redefined and a new judgment criterion is introduced in The algorithm can mine the positive, invalid and negative association rules directly without processing missing values The experiment shows that the new algorithm has short execution times, and can mine effective association rules efficiently Keywords-association mining;rough set;incomplete information systems; expectation effect I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rules mining as an important technique of data mining was firstly developed by Agrawal et al[1   N o w  association rules extracted are often positive association rules based on the support-confidence criteria. Let X, Y be a set of items, “X causes Y to happen” is often called a positive rule. “X causes Y not to happen” is called a negative rule. Negative association rules play an important role in decision making in the fields of investment analysis and competitive analysis. Brin et al[2 o in t e d ou t th e im po rt an c e  of negative rules. Savasere et al[3 xpr e s s e d t h e p r ob l e m s o f  negative rules . Luo Ke et al[4 e d e ffe ct  a s  a  cr i t e r io n   and mined both positive and negative association rules Incomplete information systems\(IIS\are the widest forms of data existence. Incompleteness of objects is the biggest obstacle studying from data. There are two types of approaches for IIS. One is to transform the incomplete systems to complete ones. For example, removing methods[5 f ill in g th e m i ssin g v a lu es 6 7    an d e t  al  B u t these methods above may make the data distorted to some degree, and noisy maybe introduced into datasets so that the rules extracted are unusable. Another is to obtain the rules from IIS directly without processing missing values. The common method is based on rough sets[8 An algorithm to mine association rules in incomplete information systems is presented. The support and confidence are redefined and a new judgment criterion is introduced in based on the rough set theory. The algorithm can mine both positive and negative association rules directly without processing missing values II  B ASIC CONCEPTS  A  Association rules The aim of mining association rules is to find out the hidden, interesting relationships among the items in large datasets. The basic concepts of association rules are given as follows   Let 12 m    I  III  be a set of items and 12     n D tt t  be a set of transactions, where t i is a set of items such that i tI 002 An association rule is an implication of the form XY 000 where  XY I 003 and XY 004=\005 The rule XY 000 holds in the set D with support and confidence  where support is the percentage of transactions in D that contain both X and Y, and confidence is the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also contain Y An association rule must satisfy a user-set minimum support minsup and minimum confidence minconf The rule XY 000 is called a strong association rule if support  0011 minsup and confidence 0011 minconf  B  Classification of association rules The conventional framework for mining association rules is the support-confidence. But using this conventional framework it may produce a lot of redundant, useless and even misleading rules. So people introduce into new criteria to strengthen the judgments of strong association rules. In  it added the effect in the judgment criterion, and gave two thresholds of effect E1 and E2\(E1<0<E2, approaching zero It classified strong association rules into positive, invalid and negative association rules. The classification of association rules is shown in table I TABLE I  C LASSIFICATION  OF  ASSOCIATION  RULES  Classification Support Confidence Effect positive rules 0011 minsup  0011 minconf effect 0011 E2 invalid rules 0011 minsup  0011 minconf  E2>effect>E1 negative rules 0011 minsup  0011 minconf effect 0010 E1 III  M INING ASSOCIATION RULES IN IIS A  Incomplete information systems\(IIS The definition of incomplete information systems\(IIS\is given as follows[10

Definition 1 Information system IS is a tuple  I SUAVf  where U  is a nonempty finite set of objects called the universe of discourse A  is a nonempty finite set of attributes Va  is a set of values for the attribute a aA a VV 002  000   f UA V 006 is a information function, it give a value to every attributes, i.e aA 007\002  xU 002    a f xa V 002  If aA 010\002  xU 002   fxa  the information systems is called incomplete information systems\(IIS\, otherwise it is complete B  Rough sets approaches It is hoped to handle data with no changes of the original information for mining association rules in IIS. Rough set theory[11 is a n e w m a th e m atic al a p p r o a ch t o  d e a l w ith  imprecision, uncertainty and incompleteness. In this paper equivalence relation, upper and lower approximation, and boundary are redefined for mining association rules Definition 2 000\003 Let     I SUAVf  be a complete information systems 000\037 attribute, value 000!\000\003 is called a relation item, that is  av where aA 002  a vV 002  Definition 3 Let      I SUAVf  be a complete information system, equivalence relation R X based on item X is expressed as     R XxU avXfxav 002 007 002  1 R X indicates the set of objects which are match to X in U Because there are missing values\(*\ in IIS, equivalence relation doesn’t exist in datasets. But we can define the max set and the min set of objects matching to items. These definitions are similar to upper and lower approximation in classical rough set Definition 4 Let  I IS U A V f  be an incomplete information system, for xU 002 we denote R X the max set of the objects that are equivalent to X, i.e     R XxU avXfxav 002 007 002  000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003 2 000\003 and denote R X 000\003 the max set of the objects that are similar to X, i.e      RX x U a v X f x a v f x a 002 007 002 011  000\003 3 the boundary of X is defined 000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003\000\003  R bn X RX RX   4 It can be seen from Definition 4 that URX  000\003 indicates the set of objects which are surely unable to match X; and URX  000\003 indicates the set of objects which may possibly not match X C  Redefinition of support and confidence The support and confidence can not be calculated exactly in incomplete information systems as complete ones, so some concepts of association rules are redefined in this paper 1  Estimates of support and confidence Based on the definition 4, the minimal and maximal possible values of support and confidence are defined as follows  Definition 5 Minimal possible support Sup min items of X is   min R X Sup X U  5 Maximal possible support Sup max f items of X is   max R X Sup X U  6 Definition 6 Minimal possible confidence Conf min  the association rule XY 000 is   min RX RY Conf X Y R XRY RX URY 004 000  004+\004 7 Maximal possible confidence Conf max the association rule XY 000 is    max RX RY Conf X Y R XRY RX URY 004 000  004 004 8 2  Expectations of support and confidence Above formulas give the estimates of support and confidence of rules in IIS. When the difference between the minimal and the maximal possible support is big, it is still very difficult to process the data. It is very favorable if the values of support and confidence are closer to the actual ones  In the rough set theory, the uncertainty of rough set is caused by the uncertainty of rough boundary h e bigger the rough boundary of X is, the smaller the certainty of rough set is. When the difference between the minimal and the maximal possible support is big, it shows that the boundary of rough set X is big. It can reduce the difference based on rough boundary so as to get the expectation value of support which is close to the actual one Definition 7 Expectation support Sup exp items of X is

Judging from this, the difference is reduced by enlarging   min Sup X which is the most conservative value of support, so that the support value is much closer to the actual one After expectation support and expectation confidence are introduced in, the effect in is redef i n e d s o as to m i n e  both positive and negative association rules in IIS Definition 9 Expectation effect Eff exp the association rule XY 000 is If minsup 013  exp Sup Y 1 and  exp Conf X Y 000 000\020  exp Sup Y 014 0, then     1 exp exp exp exp Conf X Y Sup Y Eff X Y Sup Y 000  000   12 If minsup 013  exp Sup Y 1 and  exp Conf X Y 000 000\020  exp Sup Y 0, then      exp exp exp exp Conf X Y Sup Y Eff X Y Sup Y 000  000  13 IV  D ESCRIPTION OF MINING ALGORITHM  A new algorithm for mining positive and negative association rules in incomplete information systems\(MPNAR_IIS\put forward based on classical Apriori  T h e e x p e c t at io n s u p p or t   e xpe ct a t io n co nfid e n ce and expectation effect are introduced into the mining algorithm in this paper. The process of the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1: inputting the thresholds of support, confidence and effect, that is minsup  minconf E1, E2 Step2: generating the frequent items based on Apriori while the support of each rule is expectation support Step3: computing the effect of association rules from frequent items, and giving away the invalid rules. For the rules whose effect values are minus values, considering their negative rules and recalculating their support and effect Step4: computing the expectation confidence of the association rules by Step3, reserving the rules which meet Confexp XY 000  014 minconf The strong association rules are generated following the above steps V  E XPERIMENTS  The experiment uses Mushroom dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository. This dataset contains 8124 samples and 2480 missing values. In this paper, we only mined mushroom edible or poisonous. To testify the effectiveness and performance of MPNAR_IIS MPNAR_IIS was compared with the classical association rules mining algorithm based on Apriori. And before Apriori, missing values were completed based on fuzzyclustering in [6   T h e s e ttin g o f  p a ram e te rs minsup 0.15 minconf 0.6, E1 000\020 0.1, E2=0.2. The software using in the experiment was VC++. The experiment results are shown in table 001\012  TABLE II  C LASSIFICATION  OF  ASSOCIATION  RULES  MPNAR_IIS A lgorithm based o n Apriori N umber of rules 1353 1367 Testing accurac y 98.71% 92.34 Executio n times\(s 304 375 The strong association rules mined by MPNAR_IIS are composed of 631 positive rules, 283 invalid rules and 439 negative rules. It indicates that positive rules are sometime a part of the strong association rules, and another part maybe invalid It can be seen from table 001\012 that MPNAR_IIS has obvious advantages in testing accuracy and execution times compared with the algorithm based on Apriori. It indicates that completing missing values may obtain the rules unusable and also has higher time complexity. In brief, the experiment results prove that the new algorithm has high speed and efficiency without processing missing values, and can mine both positive and negative association rules

 Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs  Fig.6  mfs and Fuzzy rules in Traditional algorithms Table 10 and Figure 7 reflect the relationship between the minimum correlation coefficient \(min_corr\d fuzzy positive and negative association rules \(FPNAR\where the former is used to remove those frequent fuzzy itemsets of weak correlation. Table 10 presents the number of fuzzy positive and negative association rules, which are generated with min_corr varying from 1 to 2.8 under such preconditions as mfs = [0.3, 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, 0.1, 0.08 d  m f c  0.6.As can be seen from Figure 7, with the min_corr increasing, the number of fuzzy association rules attained shows an obvious decreasing trend, as the minimum correlation coefficient can eliminate the rules which are generated by frequent itemsets of weak correlation, leaving more meaningful rules. So, the minimum correlation coefficient can effectively remove those meaningless or less meaningful rules to ensure that the final mined fuzzy rules are meaningful TABLE X  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MIN _ CORR AND FPNAR mfs\(k\=[0.3,0.2,0.16,0.12,0.1,0  m fc 0 6  min_corr= 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.7 2.0 2.3 2.5 2.8 PAR 326 292 249 192 133 106 72 44 NAR 604 522 435 322 193 130 80 48 TotalRules 930 814 684 514 326 236 152 92  Fig.7  relationship between min_corr and FPNAR According to the above analysis, the algorithm is adopted to mine rules from the rock sample data set.

Compared with the traditional fuzzy association rules mining algorithm, this algorithm solves the problem about the selection of fuzzy support, and generates more accurate and effective fuzzy positive and negative association rules VI  CONCLUSION There are broad development space and prospects for the mining fuzzy positive and negative association rules however, there are still many drawbacks in the selection of the membership function and minimum support, and the accuracy of selected parameters directly affects the result of the final mining rules. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy positive and negative association rules algorithm for the first time, and utilize k-means clustering method to determine the membership function, avoiding uncertainty problems which may be brought about in current existed related algorithms that need to identify the membership function subjectively Meanwhile, the multi-level fuzzy support and the correlation coefficient criterion are introduced based on fuzzy positive and negative association rules. In the end, the proposed algorithm is proved to be more effective and accurate in comparison with the traditional algorithm through an experiment REFERENCES 000>\000\024\000  R. Agrawal, T.
