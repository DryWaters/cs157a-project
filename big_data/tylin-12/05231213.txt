Through introducing the concept of dynamic time warping distance, this work proposed a way to define the dynamic time warping distance of the sequential patterns and finally carry out simulation experiments based on the defining the similarities of meta patterns KEYWORDSs: time series 002 sequential pattern 002 similarity  I   I NTRODUCTION  The time association rules are the important and valuable information implicitly contained in the time series.

For time series     2 1 n x x x X  and     2 1 m y y y Y  we can define a discrete metrics  m n ij a DM      2   j i ij y x a    ij a could denote the extent of dissimilarity between data i x  j y  In distant metrics m n ij a DM     a set composed by the elements from neighboring metrics is defined as warping distance. To suppose that K w w w W   2 1   the kth element of W is k ij k a w    this path satisfies the following conditions  1\undedness 1   max     n m K n m   2\undarieness 11 1 a w   nm K a w    3\ontinuity In the warping path, the two neighboring elements ij k a w    1 j i k a w   must satisfy 1    i i 1    j j which mean the elements in the warping path are mutually continuous  4\onotonicity in the warping path the two neighboring elements ij k a w     1 j i k a w   must satisfy  0 i i     0 j j   which means path  must pass through at least one points from   1  j i   1  1    j i  or to ensure the path is monotonous    The whole metric represents the distance metrics between two time series and each blank represents one element of the distance metrics. As illustrated by figure 1 the path between 11 a and nm a is a warping path. In the distance metrics of these two time series there re several warping paths from 11 a to nm a  However we can always find a warping path K w w w W   2 1  to minimize  K i i w 1 This path K w w w W   2 1  is defined as the optimal warping path for the distant metrics   5  6 we call this minimum value as the dynamic warping distance between time series X and which is denoted as    Y X D dtw then we have      min    2 1 1 K K i i dtw w w w W w Y X D     The dynamic warping distance two time series    Y X D dtw has the following features  1\hen n m  0    Y X D dtw 0  2\hen n m      n i i i dtw y x Y X D 1 2       We’ve only given the dynamic time warping distant but didn’t provide the way of solving it above. Exhaustive search algorithms are a possible way, but it turned out to be not practical when the pattern series is very long. The time cost is also extremely high since there might be many warping paths and they’re in a exponential relationship with the elements in the distance metrics. If point ij a is in the optimal warping path, then the sub path from point 11 a to point ij a is also a local optimal solution from which we can deduce that the optimal path from 11 a to  nm a can be gained through searching the local optimal solution from 11 a to NM a in an iterative way          1   1    1  1  min     1  1  11 j i s j i s j i s a j i s a s ij 2.1 n i  3  2  m j  3  2  In the distance metrics the minimum accumulated value in the warping path is    n m s Then, we can get the optimal path by regressing from ij a to the beginning point  1  1  s according to the minimum accumulative values in the warping path 7  8  and compute the dynamic warping distance    Y X D dtw of these two pattern series distance    Y X D dtw of the time series we can generalize that 1\ Dynamic warping distance can be used Figure 1 Dynamic warping path

to calculate the distance between two time series with random lengths 2\ The warping on the timeline is insensitive 9 10  IV  T HE DYNAMIC TIME WARPING ALGORITHM FOR SEQUENTIAL PATTERN SIMILARITIES  We can only compute the distance between two series with equal length no matter using the meta pattern monotonous or vector distance of the sequential pattern or using the weighting pattern distance [1 Dynamic time warding distance method can be applied in computing the distance between two points with different dimensions this idea can be introduced in computing the distance between series with different length The pattern series generated from time     2 1 n x x x X  and     2 1 m y y y Y  are     2 1 t X M M M S       2 1 p Y N N N S      i i i t a M   is the meta pattern of X S     j j j t a N   is the meta pattern of Y S    2  1   2  1  p j t i    Then we can built up the distance metrics for these two pattern series p t ij a DM         j i wei ij N M D a   denotes the weighted distance between i M the i th meta pattern of pattern series X S and j N the j th meta pattern of pattern series p t ij a DM         j i wei ij N M D a   denotes the weighted distance between meta pattern i M and j N The more similar meta patterns i M  j N are the closer the value of ij a is to 0 on the contrary the more different meta patterns i M  j N are the greater ij a is [11  Similar as the dynamic time warping distance of time series searching  the optimal warding path K w w w W   2 1  in discrete metrics p t ij a DM     and calculating the optimal warping path this minimum is called as the dynamic warping distance between pattern series X S and Y S here it is represented using    Y X dtw S S D then we have       min    2 1 1 K K i i Y X dtw w w w W w S S D     The dynamic warping distance of these two pattern series2    Y X dtw S S D has the following features  1\When 0     0    Y X dtw S S D N M  2\Wwhen        Y X wei Y X dtw S S D S S D N M    Of course    Y X dtw S S D is also searched in an iterative way       2     2       2      2    min       1 1 Y Y X X dtw Y X X dtw Y Y X dtw wei Y X dtw S S S S D S S S D S S S D N M D S S D     2    Y Y X dtw S S S D is dynamic time warping distance between the first second and the last meta pattern in pattern series X S and Y S  The dynamic time warping distance of the pattern series can be used to compute the distant of time series with random length. Because the dynamic time distance of the pattern series has the features of positive, symmetry, and triangle inequation so it can be used to define the similarity of two pattern series Definition4.1The pattern series generated after compressing the time series     2 1 n x x x X  and     2 1 m y y y Y  are      2 1 t X M M M S       2 1 p Y N N N S     Y X dtw S S D is called as the similarity function for pattern series X S and Y S        Y X dtw Y X S S D S S Sim   When judging whether the two pattern series are similar we only need to compute their dynamic time warping distance .When a constant  is specified, if the value of their similarity function is below   they are similar otherwise they’re not similar Definition4.2 Converting time series     2 1 n x x x X  into pattern series, the results are     2 1 t X M M M S  For every sequential pattern X X X S S S  2 1       1 1 1 l j j j X M M M S        2 1 2 l i i i X M M M S    we call    2 1 X X dtw S S D as the similarity function for sequential patterns 1 X S and 2 X S      Y X S S Sim    Y X dtw S S D    1 1 t l i i    t l j j    1  1

V  S IMULATION E XPERIMENTS  We use all data from Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index in both the year of 2006 and 2007 as our experimental objects like illustrated by figure 2and figure 3.They re converted into pattern series and contain 80 and 88 meta patterns respectively. Their distance is computed as 28.4 using pattern series dynamic time warping distance methods. Therefore the pattern series of these two time series are not quite similar. This is because that in 2006, the                        Shanghai and Shenzhen index increased tardily. However in the 2007 nearly all stockers entered the market which promoted the rapid increase in the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index and therefore resulted the great difference between 2006 and 2007  R EFERENCES   1 Y i ngj un W o ng  Zho ngy i n g Zhu T i m e se r i e s  clustering algorithms analysis based on piecewise linear dynamic time warping.

From the data mining language, users can specify the interested items or the sequences, and the minimum support and the minimum confidence threshold to discover interesting multidimensional association rules. And then according to Rough set theory, we transform multi-dimensional association rules to elementary sets description, antecedents corresponding with feature classes, consequent corresponding with concept in RS, and then propose the efficient data mining algorithm MIMAR-RS to process the user requirements, combined with the idea of generating frequent itemsets dynamically thus reducing the search space to produce frequent itemsets reducing the time complexity.
