past patient medical history to determine the set of possible illnesses an individual could develop Each model is generated by using the set of frequent diseases that contemporarily appear in the same patient The illnesses a patient could likely be affected in the future are obtained by considering the items induced by high con\336dence rules generated by the frequent diseases Experimental results show that the proposed approach is a feasible way to diagnose diseases In the last few years we are witnessing to an increasing 
interest in the application of computational science methods to health care information and management systems The utilization of information technologies that could signi\336cantly improve ef\336ciency and effectiveness of health care strategies are very important because of the implications they could have in every day life of individuals An emerging viewpoint aims at identifying prospective health care models to determine the risk for individuals to develop speci\336c diseases In f act pre v ention or inter vention at the disease\325s earliest onsets allow advantages for 
both the patient in terms of life quality and the medicare system in terms of costs However recognizing the origin of an illness is not an easy task because it can be generated by multiple causes Physicians prescribe laboratory tests only after the appearance of patient\325s complains and use family and health history to assess the hypothesized problem The approach is thus reactive i.e a medical treatment is undertaken only after the patient has already developed the disease rather than proactive Hospitals and physicians however collect thousands of 
patient clinical histories that include valuable information regarding illness correlations and development The patient medical records contain important enlightenment regarding the co-occurrences of diseases affecting the same individual A comorbidity relationship between two illnesses exists whenever they appear simultaneously in a patient more than chance alone Although comorbidity is v ery common in the population and its extension increases with age few investigations have been conducted on patient\325s comorbid conditions The comorbidity relationships between diseases however could be exploited to build a model that 
predicts the diseases a patient could have in the future Advanced risk assessment tools are currently at disposal mainly based on statistical techniques 7 Another approach for addressing the problem which is gaining increasing interest is the use of methodologies coming from the 336elds of knowledge discovery Among the most recent proposals coming from this research 336eld Davis et al 6 ha v e been the 336rst that used patient clinical history for disease prediction They built a collaborative assessment and recommendation engine based on the ICD-9-CM codes to predict future diseases 
The engine relies on the collaborative 336ltering methodology used for producing recommendations to people by collecting preferences from users having similar behaviors A patient is characterized by a vector of diagnosed diseases and a prediction is made on the base of other similar patients The similarity function adopted includes the inverse frequency of diseases to reduce the weights of very common sicknesses In order to apply the collaborative 336ltering technique the training set of patients is reduced by removing all those patients having one or no disease in common 
with the active patient Steinhaeuser and Chawla used a h ybrid technique based on collaborative 336ltering and nearest neighbor classi\336cation The similarity between two patients is computed with the

most similar patients are selected to make a prediction They found that almost the 42 of diseases were predicted as expected A disease network is also built and their structural properties studied In this paper we propose a recommendation engine for disease prediction that combines clustering and association analysis techniques The system named  system is described Section 4 336nally reports the evaluation of the proposed approach on a data set of patient medical records tion of common diseases that two patients have with respect to their union Given a patient the The data set consists of medical records of 1462 patients of a small town in the south of Italy Each record contains a unique patient identi\336ers date of birth the gender and the list of disease codes with the date of the visit in which that disease has been diagnosed The disease codes are those de\336ned by the International Classi\336cation of Diseases Ninth  We 336rst give an overview of the system then a description of each module is reported The prediction system as depicted in Figure 1 consists of two main components an off-line component for the  extends the approach proposed in by introducing a clustering phase on the data set of patient records that allows the generation of local more specialized and accurate prediction models instead of a general global model  and an on-line component for the  The 7 Figure 1 An overview of the 2 Data description 3 A Framework for Disease Prediction CORE system Revision Clinical Modi\336cation ICD-9-CM The International Classi\336cation of Diseases ICD and Related Health Problems supplies codes to classify diseases and a wide variety of signs Every health condition is associated with a unique category and given a code up to 336ve digits long The 336rst three digits constitute the principal diagnosis while the other two identify secondary diagnoses The ICD is published by the World Health Organization and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics reimbursement systems and automated decision support in medicine The data is completely anonymized thus there is no way to identify the patients In our database the number of diagnoses are 8768 spanning from 1990 to 2009 From an analysis of the patient records we found that the raw data contained some disease not informative for our study These diagnoses have thus been eliminated Some patients had no or only one diagnosis These patients have been discarded because not useful After this preprocessing phase the database reduced to 1105 patients and the number of diseases was 972 However the number of diseases was still too high As described above the 336rst three digits of a code denote the general diagnosis Even if some details can be missed these three digits are suf\336ciently informative to study the disease correlations Thus the 336ve digits ICD-9-CM codes have been collapsed to these 336rst three digits in such a way the number of diseases was reduced to 330 In the next section we 336rst give an overview of the system architecture proposed to perform disease prediction then a description of each embedded module is reported CORE disease prediction k COmorbidity-based Recommendation Engine CORE CORE uses the past patient medical history for generating models able to determine the risk of individuals to develop future diseases Analogously to Davis et al a patient is represented by the set of ICD-9-CM codes of diagnosed diseases and a disease is predicted by comparing a patient with individuals having a similar clinical history However differently from their approach we use association analysis to generate a disease predictive model composed by more models each speci\336c to a particular patient pro\336le The model is built by using the set of frequent diseases that contemporarily appear in the same patient The diseases the patient could likely be affected in the future are obtained by considering the items induced by high con\336dence rules generated by recurring disease patterns The medical record of a patient is then compared with the patterns discovered by the model and a set of illnesses is predicted The approach is similar to that used in recommendation systems from web usage data where given the pages visited by a user during a web session a recommendation value for the next page the user will probably visit is computed on the base of behavioral pro\336les induced on groups of users sharing similar navigational habits 14 Experimental results sho w that the approach is a promising method to predict individual diseases by taking into account only the illnesses a patient had in the past and that the specialization of the models on group of similar patients increases the prediction accuracy The paper is organized as follows The next section brie\337y describes the data set used In section 3 the CORE model generation 


 this algorithm partitions  f is the number of medical records of cluster t i t i the set of records belonging to the cluster  then the representative t m C k k C i k C i t q d p t i t i  t j of the cluster Formally the clustering algorithm 336nds a partition D C i  t i t i t i t j t i t j t i k  T C i 1 r j r j r l r i d T C i d T C i appears Clearly the clustering algorithm assumes that the number of clusters minimizes the cost function C j r  Jaccard coef\336cient 0 Jaccard t t       t i patients d C i  1 which is based on the idea that the similarity between two itemsets is directly proportional to the number of their common items and inversely proportional to the number of different ones Therefore given two records r C i is assigned to a cluster k 3.1 Model Generation k d Data Preparation r j  f T from a vector 1 where C i  D C i k 3 k Q k  0  C j C t j t j T Essentially the algorithm works as follows Firstly Clustering   into   of patients sharing most of their disease history it that it is an effective way of improving the accuracy of the prediction model as experimental results will show Performing clustering is not an easy task at all since its performances are tightly related to the kind of method used For the purposes of this paper we decided to exploit a straightforward variant of the traditional    in a way that high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity are guaranteed d l k l Q k i i k i t j i t i T be the number of patients contained in the original data set of patient histories The data preparation module transforms the original data set into a new data set C i for 1 has to be 336xed at the beginning Thus another open issue is how to set T d    such that 1 for each C i j randomly They represent the initial cluster centers and each other k T summarizes the medical histories relative to all the  m is assigned to a cluster on the base of condition 2 Then the algorithm updates the representative of each cluster and re-assigns each record consequently The iterations terminate when the representatives do not change any more i.e the condition 3 holds It is worth to note that the schema above is parametric w.r.t the de\336nitions of distance records are selected from r i C       Since in our scenario we deal with categorical data we used a kind of distance that proved to work very well in this setting the      k d T S S T  r C i representative  where each t i    1 1 1 1 d T clustering 10 able to deal with categorical tuples of variable size like those present in the dataset  means T C i d d q The main motivation for grouping the set T t i T clusters C i d and C d T C  is a partitioning of Let The next step pertains a suitable de\336nition for the cluster representative Intuitively the representative should model the content of the cluster in order to make trivial the interpretation of the cluster itself Among various possibilities an easy and effective way for building the representative consists in using the frequent items belonging to the cluster The frequency degree can be controlled by introducing a user-de\336ned threshold value              For a given parameter  i.e  Each record  the Jaccard distance can be de\336ned as t i                  model generation component involves a preprocessing step to transform the raw data to a transactional set of patient records constituted by a sequence of ICD-9-CM codes i.e the list of diseases a patient had Then clustering is performed to group patients on the base of the diseases they share and a representative is generated for each cluster found The representative computation is a very important step since it is used by the prediction module to decide the right model to apply for foreseeing next diseases of the current patient After that frequent patterns for each cluster are computed and a model is generated for each group Pertaining the on-line component it 336rst assigns a patient to a cluster by matching him against each cluster representative then the prediction model associated with this cluster is selected and 336nally the next expected diseases are released by applying this model It is worth to notice that the system in Figure 1 is a general predictive architecture parametric with respect to both the clustering algorithm and the prediction model used Therefore by suitably customizing the algorithms for the kind of data at disposal this architecture could be pro\336tably exploited also in different scenarios In the following a detailed description of each single component in the architecture is provided is a patient medical record of variable size constituted by a sequence of ICD-9-CM disease codes Thus according to its distance that represents the cluster at hand and is called the the representative is computed 2 iff and   i.e the disease codes and  for can be computed as follows in which in correspondence of which the cost function has its global minimum However 336nding could be unfeasible in practice Therefore we pragmatically 8        the set of items of C i C m       k representing the minimum percentage of occurrences an item must have for being

de\336ned as a couple T disease prediction   1 induced on   denotes the number of elements in a certain set The support thus determines how often a group of diseases appear together It is a very important measure because very low support discriminates those groups of items occurring only by chance Thus a frequent itemset to be considered interesting must have a support greater than a 336xed threshold value C i X C i w C i Y Y      k  Frequent itemsets having a support value above a minimum threshold are used to extract high con\336dence rules that can be exploited to build a prediction model by matching the medical record of a patient against the patterns discovered by the model In our scenario the support determines how often a group of diseases appears together while a rule like

itemsets The importance of an association rule is measured by both its    for inducing a pattern-based prediction schema able to generate predictions about the diseases a patient can incur in the future given the past history of his health conditions The main difference with the previous approach is that in this paper we deal with 322local\323 models instead of a unique global model built on the whole dataset Intuitively and as validated by experimental results local models tend to produce better prediction accuracy because the predictions are generated by considering the most similar

method  i.e the original dataset is split in 10 equal-si zed partitions During each of the 10 runs one of the partitions is chosen for testing while the rest of them are used for training the
