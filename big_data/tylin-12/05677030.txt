Ab stra c  Aiming at the phenomenon of road traffic accident frequency, a method of road traffic accidents causes analysis based on data mining was put forward. First analyzed the related attributes and causes of road traffic accidents. Then introduced two kinds of basic theory of data mining : rough sets theory and the theory of association rules. Finally proposed the method of road traffic accidents causes analysis based on data mining. Using the method of traffic data analysis, can improve 
the road traffic safety management level effectively Keywords-road traffic accidents; data mining; roughsets accident cause I  I NTRODUCTION  Road traffic is an indispensable important part to life, but the frequent road accidents bring serious bodily harm and loss of property[1   E ach  s i de of r o a d tr af f i c acc id en ts c o n t ain s  a  large amount of information and data is the most common form of the most important information records. Via mining 
the data of road traffic accident, we can analysis accident characteristics in multi-angles, multi-level and more comprehensive, and discover potential rules   M e a n w h i l e improving road traffic safety is the main content of intelligent transportation system and it has guiding significance to the design of intelligent transportation system II  R OAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ANALYSIS  A  Attribute analysis The data of traffic accidents comes from the scene 
investigation  O n e ac c i dent t r ea t m e n t i n cl ud i ng w h e n  accident happens, according to the situation of the field survey and analysis, mark the scene of the accident and related to the accident feature extraction of data, such as time, weather accident incident surface morphology, and the accident casualties of data. And by asking about the scene of the accident, understand the course of the accident Traffic accident data is the foundation of traffic accident 
cause analysis. Based on the ministry of public security database of traffic accident analysis we can find that [4 r af f i c  accident data presented to radial and multi-dimensional three-dimensional structure, multi-level super. Each road traffic accidents records contain multiple data attributes. Each attribute value reflected an characteristic in a traffic accident And the more data attribute data constitute the multiple dimensions of traffic accidents. In addition, data attributes are set from the basic accident information, personnel information 
vehicle information, road information and environmental information, so that the data attributes and the five perspectives\( people, vehicles , road, environment and the basic information\ form two levels in logical, which the five perspectives\( people, vehicles , road, environment and the basic information\ are the top level and the data attributes are the lower B  Cause analysis Because of cooperate with disorders among people 
vehicles, road and environment, road traffic accidents are the occasional unexpected event in the road traffic system. Cause analysis of traffic accidents are mainly the research on the formation of traffic accidents by people, vehicles, roads and environmental aspects [1  978-1-4244-5392-4/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


Human factors. People are the moving of a traffic safety and the main body of traffic safety. In the road traffic system the persons are not only the maker of traffic accidents, but also the victims. The persons include all those who use the roads such as drivers, passengers, pedestrians. They are objective object in the transportation system. Without comprehensive and timely perception, correctly thinking, accurately determine and sensitive operation response, it will lead to traffic accidents. In this paper we mainly analysis the factors of driver's side, and it can be summarized in figure 1   Figure 1  Driver factors affecting the traffic safety Vehicle factors. Vehicles are the main running tool of modern traffic. The quality of technical condition of vehicles is a direct factor affecting road safety. The main vehicle factors are the motor factor. Poor motor performance, mechanical failure or parts damage may be the direct factor causing traffic accidents. The main impact factors of autocar safety are steering, braking, driving and electric. The influence factors of motor vehicles on the road safety are shown in figure 2  Figure 2  Vehicle factors affecting the traffic safety Road factors. The linear, slope, linear combination, road surface conditions and the technical level, facilities conditions have great impact on traffic safety, and the specific impact factors can be list in figure 3  Figure 3  Road factors affecting the traffic safety Environmental factors. The external environment on road safety can not be ignored, and we use figure 4 to represent the impact of environment on the road traffic safety  Figure 4  Environmental factors affecting the traffic safety III  T HE BASIC THEORY OF DATA MINING  Data Mining is the process that to extract information and knowledge which are potentially useful without known in advance from a large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy random real data. In short it is to extract or "mining knowledge from the large amounts of data Data mining technology has a powerful data analysis capability. According to road traffic accident data, it can find the potential accident information or rules through data mining method and provide data analysis support for the road safety research [5 


A  Rough Set Theory The fuzzy and uncertainty of rough set theory is based on the concept of the border, that is, a collection has fuzzy boundaries in particular knowledge [6 R e l a t i v e t o  a pa rt i c ul ar case, each set can be expressed by the exact concept of the upper approximation and the lower approximation of that according to the knowledge representation system    A U S   design U X A R   set and upper approximation   X R  of X the lower approximation   X R  can be expressed as            X Y R U Y X R 1       X Y R U Y X R     2 At the same time, defined     X R X pos R   as X s R positive domain     X R U X neg R    as X s R negative domain       X R X R X bn R     as X s R boundary region Visually speaking X s R positive domain is a set of knowledge R that can be classified to X  X s R boundary region is the set of the knowledge R that can not determine whether classified to X  R upper approximation is the set of the knowledge R that my be classified into X and it is also the merger of positive region and boundary region B  Theory of association rules Association rules is an important topic in the field of data mining proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and others. Association rules reveal the relationship among the data. Association rule mining is to analysis the frequency relationship of the data sets in the transaction from a given set of data items and transactions \(each transaction is a data collection of items\7   Association rule mining can find large amounts of data in an interesting correlation between item sets or related links IV  A NALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS B ASED ON DATA MINING  For the road traffic accidents in specific time and space each accident occurred is not completely independent. We should take full account of the relationship of the accident between other road traffic accidents in the specific context Firstly analysis the association rules of historical data on road traffic accidents appling data mining, and take it as the standard mode, recognize the single cause pattern of the accident, and finally get their specific causes The forward set of road traffic accidents influence factors include road linear, traffic control method, weather conditions etc. And the accident attributes are the latter set including the accident level and accident form. By the association mining of road traffic accident data, in a certain threshold condition, we can obtain in a series of association rules on the cause, like the form B A A A i 2 1 formatting the associated rule sets of road traffic accidents causes. For the particular latter set B q  of association rules, there exists a generalized association rules matrix J constitute the causes of the comparison matrix, as in 3  q nk n n q j q i B A A A B A A A B A A A J 2 1 2 22 21 1 12 11 3 Define the standard model set M of the road traffic causes in which the standard mode 1 is M 1 the standard model 2 is M 2 the standard mode n is M n as in \(4  n q nk n n q j q i M B A A A M B A A A M B A A A M    2 1 2 2 22 21 1 1 12 11 4 Where, the support of q mj m m B A A A 2 1 is sm p  and the confidence level is cm p One road traffic accident to be identified can be expressed as    q B A G  in which      2 1 l A A A A   q B are the incident type value of the property after the accident experience. The general membership of road traffic accident G is defined as    G m   to the standard model M m Establish generalized membership function of the causes of road traffic patterns, as in \(5       j i i n l sl sm m p p j G 1 1   1       5 


Where the forward dimension of the standard mode M m  corresponding to the cause association rules, values of 1,2 P sm the support \(%\ of the standard mode M m  corresponding to the cause association rules   the weight of index j  Among them i  is the property for road accidents discriminant function, as in \(6  012  A A A A mi mi i  1  0  6 Where A the property value of item i of the standard mode M m corresponding to the cause association rules’ forward set, values of 1,2, ..., j the impact factor set of road traffic accidents of G  Through standardize the generalized membership function we can get the standard membership function   G m  of the genetic model of road traffic accidents, as in \(7    n i i m m G G G 1            7 Using the membership function above criteria to calculate road traffic accident on a standard model G the degree of membership, and choose the maximum degree of membership as in\(8        max   2 1 G G G G n r      8 Select the maximum degree of value, determine the causes model of road traffic accidents G as in \(9 r M G  9 By the pattern recognition model, the causes of a single road traffic accident will be added into the standardized set of the regional road traffic accidents causes, that is associated with the completion of the causes analysis of the accident V  C ASE ANALYSIS  Extract 100 sets data from traffic accidents database of a certain city, and then analysis the road traffic accident data using the method in this paper, finally obtained each traffic accident causes mode. Via checked by manpower, the accuracy rate of the accident cause model extents to 86 which satisfy the demand of traffic safety management VI  C ONCLUSION  The study on road traffic accident causes can identify the key factors rapidly and efficiently and provide instructional methods to the traffic accidents’ prevention and road traffic accidents’ reduction, which could greatly reduce personal casualty and property loss caused by road traffic accidents Meanwhile, it would be helpful for improving the efficiency and security service level of the road transportation system The study of this paper can provide forceful data analysis support for the road traffic safety related research A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The author expresses his sincere appreciation to the Chinese National High Technology Research and Development Program Committee for the financial support of this project under grants No. 2009AA11Z208 and 2009AA11Z218 R EFERENCES  1  He Ming.

The occurrence of a pattern is assumed to consume the information associated with the primary events describing the pattern. For this reason, each input feature can support at most one rule firing, in order to maintain the assumption of statistical independence of the input featu 16 VI E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The pattern discovery and classification modules were successfully implemented. A large sample dataset was used as input and the rules were got as output. The modules were successfully tested on various datasets and results were obtained TABLE I I NPUT DATA SET A training dataset D is used as input to the algorithm 10 D consists of six input features with five attributes Red”, “Blue”, “Green”, “Hue”, “Saturation” and a label “Texture 1500 record sets were considered A Parameters The three important parameters, which had to be decided on, are Q number of quantization bins H threshold level for statistical significance  valid significance test cut-off 1 Q value The value of Q was a tradeoff between the classification precision and the computational complexity Taking all the parameters into consideration, the value of Q was fixed as 5 2 H value The threshold level was chosen to be a standard value of 1.96 which corresponds to 95 percent confidence level which ensures a reasonable assertion to make a strong suggestion in decision support system  3 value The valid significance test cut off was decided based on the size of the database. To eliminate the spurious patterns early in pattern discovery phase, and to avoid exhaustive search of the data set, an optimum value of was chosen as 10 B Quantization The numeric data of all the 5 input features were discretized using maximum marginal entropy partitioning  Each sample space was divided into quantization bins along each margin The value of Q was chosen as 5 The input data was distributed over the 5 quantized bins in such a way that the entropy was maximized The number of sample data in each bin was equal 1 Quantized bins TABLE II Q UANTIZED BINS C Events generated After quantization the input sample space is partitioned into events each of which can be determined probabilistically Primary events are the basic building blocks A :  [a  a3 a4 a 5 B :  [b  b3 b4] [b 5 C :  [c  c3] [c 4] [c5  D  d3] [d 4] [d5 E :  [e1 e2 e3 e 4 e5 The primary events are connected to form higher order events Second order [a1 a2, b 2 Third order [a1, a2, a b1, b2 And so on D Rules generated 303 rules were generated. Each rule mapped an event to a label value and the following are some of the rules generated IF \(Green 0.0...3.55556\\(Hue 0.0...8.22222\THEN Window IF \(Blue 0.0...7.33333\and \(Green 3.55556...16.8889 THEN Cement IF \(Blue 0.0...7.33333\ \(Hue 8.33333...23.6667 THEN Cement IF \(Red 0.0...5.44444\\(Blue 7.33333...20.0 Foliage

Of the 1500 input sets, 949 were correctly labeled 26.3333,35.2222,25.6667,35.2222,-2.04915,Brickface Miss : LABEL  :  Window 13.1111,17.8889,21.5556,21.5556,2.69011,Cement Hit : LABEL  :  Cement 0,1.33333,0,1.33333,-2.0944,Foliage Hit : LABEL  :  Foliage 6.55556,6.44444,11.5556,11.5556,2.09315,Cement Hit : LABEL  :  Cement 0.777778,3,0,3,-1.82221,Grass Miss : LABEL  :  Foliage 0.444444,6.44444,1.44444,6.44444,-2.26954,Foliage Miss : LABEL  :  Path 115.111,142.222,121.333,142.222,-2.33375,Path Hit : LABEL  :  Path 51.8889,72.4444,49.6667,72.4444,-1.99159,Brickface Hit : LABEL  :  Brickface 7.44444,7.11111,14.6667,14.6667,2.06945,Cement Hit : LABEL  :  Cement 41,57.2222,39.5556,57.2222,-2.01072,Brickface Hit : LABEL  :  Brickface No of hits : 949 C ONCLUSION Hence a framework for nonfuzzy classification is proposed and proved experimentally. This model identifies statistically significant event associations inherent in a given data set, using residual analysis to test whether or not a pattern candidate is significantly deviated from a default loglinear model. The generated rules annotated with weight of evidence are fired independently to classify the input feature vector In scenarios where labeling requires further statistical augmentation, a deterministic means of confidence could be derived. The confidence measure can be further combined with the label to supplement the decision analogous to multiple votes. The proposed non-fuzzy model leveraging such weighted classifiers increases the accuracy of decisionmaking R EFERENCES  M Hol s heimer and A.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
