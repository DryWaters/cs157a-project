     The number of association rules is part of data utility, the correct number of association rules is also a key part of data utility So we introduce the following equation AR \(accuracy radio M / N where N is the number of association rules for original data and M is the number of common association rules for anonymous data Figure 6 is the accuracy radio of T40I10D100K. It shows that, when confident decreases, the accuracy radio increases Because our algorithm losses the information of unusual association rules while maintains the information of usual association rules D  Execution time Figure 7 is the time cost of T40I10D100K. It shows that our algorithm is very efficient, when the l value increases, the time cost will slightly increases because it costs a little more time to meet l diversity Figure 7  Time Cost of T40I10D100K VI  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we study the privacy issues in transaction data publication. Based on anatomy technique, we propose a new privacy model called multi-dimension anatomy that meets the privacy requirement of l diversity and suits to transaction data We introduce a simple linear-time anonymous algorithm Experiments show that our algorithm can safely and effectively protect privacy in transaction data There are still a number of promising areas for future work First, the linear-time algorithm proposed in this paper seems a little simple, some new heuristic algorithm needs to further research. Second, while an anatomized table has been generated, it remains an open problem on how to use the anonymized data A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research by the NFS of Fujian Porvince under grants No 2009J01295, the NFS of Fujian Province under grants No 2010J01330 and scientific project of Fujian Provincial Department of Education under grants No. JA09004 R EFERENCES  1  K.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
