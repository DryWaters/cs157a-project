Keywords: Collaborative Filtering, General Neighborhood Recommender System, Personalized Recommendation  I   I NTRODUCTION  In recent years, collaborative filtering has attracted a considerable amount of research attention resulting in the proposal of a large variety of CF approaches [4ecen t l y   a fatal issue in collaborative filtering, general neighborhood problem, is identified in our previous work f act, in t h e  almost cases, the problem often could result into wrong recommendation. In order to avoid the problem, Collaborative Filtering based on Community \(CFC\s presented. Although 
CFC make essential improvement for CF, unfortunately, it suffers from severer sparsity, more techniques are used to enhance it. Pre-filling is widely used, including vertical prefilling \(VPF for short\d horizontal pre-filling \(HPF for short\re-filling based on user-community pair \(PUC suggested to improve them by combing VPF and HPF. But, it still could suffer from sparsity which results into disability to pre-filling when all items from a certain category \(community are null for active user. So, pre-filling based on association rule is presented to improve when PUC suffer from sparsity Based on a series of above methods, a complete and 
hierarchical Collaborative Filtering Method System CFMS\ is build. CFMS extend simple collaborative filtering, adapting to various different situations. Experiments are made to empirically valuate and compare various methods of CFMS The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a review on related literature. In section 3 collaborative filtering based on community is presented. In section 4, pre-filling based on user-community pair \(PUC proposed for limitation of CFC. In section 5, pre-filling based on community association \(PCA\d CFC based on PCA CAN\nted to overcoming limitation of PUC. In section 6, a complete and hierarchical collaborative filtering methods system is build, including tree structure and flowing 
chart of methods. Finally, experimental evaluation is empirically made. Some concluding remarks and directions for future research are provided  II  R ELATED W ORK  Tapestry is one of the earliest implementations of collaborative filtering-based recommender systems.

The MAR approach proposed in Kim and Kim \(2003\sociation rules between categories in multiple-level product taxonomies to address data sparseness [16    Although a lot of works contribute to collaborative filtering, to my best knowing, there is no previous work showing that classical collaborative filtering is not suit to multi-interests recommendation or multi-community recommendation due to general neighborhood problem. We present collaborative filtering based on community in previous work. Unfortunately, CFC suffers from severer sparsity. In this paper, after various improvements are made for CFC based on the series of methods, a complete and hierarchical collaborative filtering method system is build  III  CF  B ASED ON C OMMUNITY  A  General Neighborhood Problem in CF Collaborative filtering \(CF\rely on the fact that each person belongs to a larger group of similar behaving individuals Neighborhood Neighborhood is determined the userês General Similarity which is based on all co-rated items The neighborhood is called as General Neighborhood They share general similar interest in various interest domains with active user. However, they could not share the most similar interest in a certain special interest field \(community\with active user. So, to predict preference of user for a target item general neighborhood should not be used to produce recommendation since they do not share the similar interest in target item. But traditional collaborative filtering does so. We call the problem as general neighborhood problem  B  CF Based on Community The ècommunityê has two meanings. One means category of items, where a community is a category of items whose have similar content characteristics and attributes. Another means group of users whose share common interest in a certain special field or have similar preference for a category of items. The former is called as Item Community while the latter is called as User Community In this paper, ècommunity means Item Community  General neighborhood is based on co-ratings for all communities. If neighborhood is determined based on coratings for a special item community, to which the target item belongs, the general neighborhood could be avoid. We call neighborhood determined by co-ratings of users for a special community as Community Neighborhood as shown in Figure 1. In order to overcome general neighborhood in CF community neighborhood should be used to generate recommendation. Collaborative filtering based community CFC\ described as in Figure 2. It is easy to find that CFC suffers from heavier sparsity. Effective method must be employed to enhance the CFC by overcoming sparsity  Figure 1.

CFC Algorithm  IV  P RE FILLING B ASED ON U SER COMMUNITY FOR I MPROVING CFC In order to overcome the sparsity, the pre-filling method is employed to pre-fill null rating before producing community neighborhood. The method is widely used to deal with sparsity issue in many fields. In this section, two pre-filling methods vertical pre-filling \(VPF\d horizontal pre-filling \(HPF respectively, are first analyzed. Based on them, pre-filling based on user-community pair is proposed A  Vertical and Horizontal Pre-filling The vertical pre-filling VPF for short\method is done by averaging the ratings of all users for a fixed item vertically. By the method, missing rating is pre-filled with average value of ratings of all users for corresponding item. The horizontal prefilling HPF for short\method is done by averaging the ratings of a fixed user for all items horizontally. That is to say null rating is pre-filled with average value of ratings of corresponding user for all other items. The two method have their limitations B  Pre-filling based on User-Community Pair \(PUC In order to overcome the limitations of HPF and VPF, prefilling based on user-community pair \(PUC\ proposed. For PUC, it is supposed that a user has similar interest in items from same item community and missing rating could be prefilled with average rating of current user for items from same community with filled item. Detail PUC method is described as Figure 3   General Neighborhood Active User Community Nei g hborhood Community Neighborhood

PUC Method For example, in Table 1, it is supposed that we need to pre-fill R 33 for CFC algorithm in order to overcome sparsity. If both VPF method and HPF method are exploited to pre-fill R 33 pre-filled value are respectively 2 and 3. If PFC method is exploited to done, then pre-filled value will be 3+4+1+5\25 by averaging R 31  R 35  R 37 and R 39 because item I 1  I 3  I 5  I 7 and I 9 are from same item community, English community and R 31  R 33  R 35  R 37 and R 39 are preference value of user U 3 for same community items. It is reasonable that R 31  R 33  R 35  R 37 and R 39 are close It is obvious that PUC is better than simple VPF and HPF since ratings used to pre-fill are more related to pre-filled rating. It only focuses ratings of a user on the items from same community. But it could often happens that ratings of a user on all items from a certain community are missing, which make PUC method invalid. For example, in Table 1 R 22  cannot be pre-filled by PUC because ratings of user U 2 for item I 4  I 6 and I 8 from Football community are missing. In this case, in next section, CAN method is suggested Table 1.

In practice CFC is executed after pre-filling method is performed to weaken the sparsity. So, each pre-filling method could be corresponding to a CFC recommendation method Recommendation methods corresponding to three pre-filling methods, VPF, HPF and PUC respectively, are called as CFCVPF, CFC- HPF and CFC-PUC  V  CF  B ASED ON C OMMUNITY A SSOCIATION AND C OMMUNITY N EIGHBORHOOD CAN For CAN, association degree between different communities is firstly analyzed. It is supposed that although interests of users in different community items are different some communities may be associated. The hypothesis shows that interests of user in a community could still give us some information on his interests in other community, such as like association of beer with diaper. Helping from the view, we can pre-fill the rating though association of current community to other communities and ratings of user for items from other community. As shown in Fig.4, if we want to pre-fill R 22 and ratings of user U 2 for other items from community C 1 whihc I 2  belong to are null, then simple PFC method cannot be exploited to pre-fill R 22 For this case, if we find that community C 1 is associated to community C 2 then rating of user U 2 for item I 2 can be pre-filled though ratings of U 2 for items from community C 2 Apart from ratings of U 2 for items from community C 2 association degree between community C 1 and community C 2 should be considered when pre-filling In order to mining association rule among different communities, ratings of users for all community items will be used. Since rating is not binary, sharp boundary problem will happen when traditional association rule mining method is exploited and much preference information will be lost when rating data is directly transferred into binary data. In order to employ association rule method for binary data, but litter preference information is lost, fuzzy association rule method is often exploited [19, 20 orde r t o f i n d as s o ci at i o n ru l e  between communities based on rating matrix, Fuzzy association rule mining \(FAR\mployed. The CAN algorithm is described as Figure 5   Figure 4.

Collaborative Filtering Method Tree Traditional CF is most simple recommendation algorithm which only adapt to situation where all recommended items belong to alone interest title or do main. If the condition can not be satisfied, CFC algorithm is considered. But only when rating is enough dense, community neighborhood of every user in each community can be determined. Otherwise, CFC based on pre-filling is used. Although there are many prefilling method, generally, PUC is suggested to be exploited But if there is no enough data, VPF and HPV are alternative In order to use CFC-PUC, rating data should be enough dense so rating of each user-community can be computed, otherwise CAN should be performed. The flow chart of various methods is shown in Figure 7  Figure 7.  Collaborative Filtering Method Flowing Chart In the following, various methods are evaluated through experiments  VII  EXPERIMENT  EVALUATION A  Dataset Datasets employed in our experiment are from EachMovie  collaborative filtering service. The EachMovie service was part of a research project at the Systems Research Center of Digital Equipment Corporation. The service was available for a period of 18 months and was shut down in September 1997 During that time the database grew to a fairly large size containing ratings from 72,916 users on 1,628 movies. User ratings were recorded on a numeric six-point scale \(0.0, 0.2 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0\The data set is publicly available and can be obtained from Digital Equipment Corporation  Although the data from 72,916 users is available, we restrict the analysis to the 450 users in the database. These 450 users provided ratings for 300 different movies. In order to test the performance of various algorithms under different conditions Dense or Sparse\ets used in our experiment are grouped into group A and group B. Dataset in group A is denseness dataset in which users have more ratings, and dataset in group B is sparse dataset in which user have little ratings. Datasets in group A are named according to its number of users. Altogether, five datasets is used in our experiment, respectively as A50, A150, A250, A350, A450 in which users respectively are the top 50, 150, 250, 350, 450 users that have the most ratings. Datasets in group B consist of ratings of top 50 150 250 350 450 user by userID for top 250 movies. They are dataset B50 B150 B250 B350 B450. Dataset in group B have heavy sparsity comparing with datasets in group A Y Y Y N N N  Community neighborhood of user for a community can not be determined Rating of use r communit y can not be computed for sparse ratings of user-item There exist multi-interest or multi-domain CAN CF CFC CFC-PUC CF CFC CFC-VPF CFC-PUC CAN CFC-HPF

So, 10 experiments are made for each datasets, in where, the best result is used to analyze in the following. For each experiment Top-N recommendation tactics is exploited, and number of recommended movie is fixed as 30 for comparing the performance of various algorithms In the algorithm CAN, movie communities in dataset Eachmovie are determined according to the type of movie provided by dataset. So, there are ten movie communities in our experiment, respectively Action, Animation, Art_Foreign Classic, Comedy, Drama, Family, Horror, Romance, and Thriller Mean Absolute Error MAE\ween ratings and predictions is a widely used metric.

Comparing of Performance under sparse dataset C  Experiment Result In this section, several findings though experiment are given. Detail experiment result is shown in Figure 8 and 9 First, it is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that all five methods based on community, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF, CFC-HPV and CFC respectively, generally achieve better performance than CF. It is explained that there exist general neighborhood problem in traditional co llaborative filtering and that community neighborhood is effective to overcome the general neighborhood in CF.  It is noticed that CFC has no advantage over CF, especially under sparsity. As shown in Figure 9, CFC show worse performance than CF. It is explained that CFC suffers from severer sparsity than CF. It tells us that simply considering community in collaborative filtering is not always good strategy Secondly, as shown in Figure 8 and 9, generally, four CFC methods based on pre-filling, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV respectively, have advantage over CFC, especially under sparsity situation. By comparing Figure 8 with Figure 9 advantage of CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV over CFC is more obvious under sparse data \(Figure 9\an under dense data \(Figure 8\It is explained that CFC could suffer from severe sparsity, and pre-filling based on community is help for overcoming the sparsity Thirdly, it is noticed that CFC-PUC generally has better performance than CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV.  It is shown that pre-filling based on user-community is better selecting Finally, it also is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that CAN generally achieve better performance than CFC-PUC. It is explained that it is not enough to pre-fill simply based on usercommunity because it is possible that certain user-community could be null, and pre-filling could not succeed. In fact, it is discovered that CAN has more obvious advantage over CFCPUC under sparse data than under dense data VIII  CONCLUSION Recommender systems are a powerful new technology for extracting additional value for a business from its user databases. Collaborative filtering is the most important 


method widely used in recommender systems. In this paper starting from general neighborhood problem, various methods are proposed and a complete collaborative filtering method system is build. Also, various methods are compared empirically each other. Although experiments elementally support our ideas, it is still need more experiments to verify them with more dataset in the future. More research need to be made to enhance CFC by other methods, such as ontology A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was partly supported by National Science Foundation of China under grants No.70871115, \(Renmin University of China\C Publishing Plan for International Journal under grants No.10XNK090.

We can see that the positive effect of genetic lateral tuning became weaker as became larger for the low imbalance data sets. On the other hand, the approaches with candidate rule addition and ge netic lateral tuning \(i.e., EC and ECW*\kept good ranking in almost all cases. This observation may indicate that the proposed extensions are effective especially for the high imbalanced data sets V   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed two extensions of our genetic fuzzy rule selection for designi ng more accurate classifiers One extension is to add compatible rules with misclassified patterns into candidate rules for genetic fuzzy rule selection The other extension is to tune membership functions by genetic lateral tuning after genetic fuzzy rule selection Experimental results showed that the candidate rule addition can improve the training data accuracy. This is because the possibility that the misclassified training patterns are classified by additional rules becomes high. Experimental results also showed that the genetic lateral tuning can improve the test data accuracy as well as the training data accuracy, since fuzzy membersh ip functions are properly adjusted according to the pattern distributions. The combination of the proposed two extensions would be the best choice As a future study, we will examine the effects of the proposed extensions using a large number of data sets TABLE  VI A DJUSTED P VALUES OBTAINED BY N EMENYI 222 S T EST   H OLM 222 S T EST   S HAFFER 222 S T EST  AND B ERGMANN H OMMEL P ROCEDURE FOR THE T EST D ATA A CCURACY OBTAINED IN OUR C OMPUTATIONAL E XPERIMENTS  i Hypothesis Unadjusted p  p Neme  p Holm  p Shaf  p Berg  1 Pareto vs. ECW 3.1 x 10 10 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.9 x 10 9  2 Pareto vs. EC 1.6 x 10 7 2.4 x 10 6 2.2 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6  3 EC vs. ECW 1.6 x 10 4 0.0024 0.0021 0.0016 0.0016 4 Pareto vs. ECW 8.0 x 10 4 0.0119 0.0095 0.0080 0.0056 5 Pareto* vs. ECW 0.0012 0.0173 0 0127 0.0116 0.0081 6 Pareto vs. Pareto 0.0024 0.0355 0 0237 0.0237 0.0142 7 ECW vs. ECW 0 0033 0.0500 0.0300 0.0237 0.0142 8 EC vs. EC 0.0064 0.0963 0.0514 0.0449 0.0385 9 Pareto vs. EC 0 0119 0.1781 0.0831 0.0831 0.0475 10 Pareto* vs. EC 0 0277 0.4156 0.1662 0.1662 0.0831 11 ECW vs. EC 0.0592 0.8876 0.2959 0.2367 0.1183 12 EC* vs. ECW 0 2945 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 13 EC vs. ECW 0.4017 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 14 EC vs. Pareto 0 6002 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 15 ECW vs. Pareto 0 7532 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 


   including data sets with more than two classes. We also have to compare the proposed method with other learning algorithms. There are still a lot of things we have to improve in the proposed extensions, es pecially the search space and genetic operations in the lateral tuning. The discussion on the tradeoff relation among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability is also another important future research issue  Pareto EC ECW Pareto EC ECW  0.00 0.01 0.05 0.10 0 2 4 6 Average rank  Fig. 9.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
