It demonstrates that the average rank of TS-GMDH is 3 ranking 4th among them without noise. However, it ranks 1st when there is 5 noise and keeps ahead when the level of noise gets higher showing that TS-GMDH outperforms other four classifiers under high level of noise   We record the accuracy of each algorithm and draw line chart to show the trend directly.

The result shows that TS-GMDH outperforms C4.5 and KNN, while we can’t tell whether there is significant difference between SVM and TS-GMDH, or TS-GMDH and NB.Therefore, we adopt Wilcoxon test and it shows that there is significant difference, that is TS-GMDH outperforms SVM and NB In summary, we come to another conclusion that TS-GMDH gets similar accuracy as others, however when noise level gets higher, it performs outstanding IV C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we firstly make comparison between TS-GMDH model and FRI model with 10-fold cross validation in Matlab. The following conclusion can be drawn TS-GMDH model is better than FRI model on classification accuracy, showing the improvement of TS-GMDH model And then, we compare TS-GMDH model with popular classification algorithms SVM, C4.5,NB and KNN. We introduce 3 different level of noise: 5%,10% and 20% to how the TS-GMDH performs in comparison with other classification algorithms with noise. We draw the second conclusion that, as noise level gets higher the performance of TS-GMDH is far superior to others showing extra capability of anti-interference As we all know, the real life and work is filled with noise, we can’t identify the true information when making decision, easily causing serious consequence In view of strong noise immunity of TS-GMDH, we recommend a new classification method in customer analysis, help companies to get useful information A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No. 70771067\and the NSFC/RS Royal Society of the UK International Joint Project \(Grant No. 70911130133 R EFERENCES  Ivakhnenko A.G.

6 Figure 7 - Workflow of incoming SKUs in the case company In the storage location selection process, the physical parameters such as the dimensions, weight and product value of SKU Figure 8 play the dominant role. When the information of these parameters is available, the put-away decision can be made appropriately. However, assigning the incoming SKUs to the storage location in the warehouse is complicated as several factors are affect the put-away decision. The major issue is the material handling cost which depends on the travelling distance between the storage location and the entrance to the warehouse One of the objectives in warehouse management is to minimize the material handling cost i.e. to shorten the distance that SKUs have to be moved. Activities associated with the SKUs activities include popularity \(frequency of demand\rnover cube movement, and pick density, significantly influence the total material handling cost in the warehouse. For example when the SKUs have a high popularity, they should be stored in the most accessible zone in order to reduce the travelling distance and time. Therefore, the warehouse manager has to capture all the parameters of SKU activities and use his knowledge and experience to complete the task in an efficient way In selecting the tier level when placing pallets on racks for storing the incoming SKUs, the objective in this task is to minimize the damage and loss of the SKUs during the put-away and storage process. The safety of the warehouse operators is also important. They may easily get injured when they put a heavy item on a high level tier. In warehouse practice, storing the heavier SKUs in the higher tiers of the pallet racks makes it easier for damage to occur during the put-away process. The more expensive the SKUs, the greater the loss to the company if any damage is caused. Therefore, the warehouse manager needs to consider the weight and value of the SKUs when making the put-away decisions From the above problems and current practice of the case company, quality storage data are necessary in SLAP. However there is no advanced IT system in the company such as the WMS, vendor managed inventory \(VMI\terprise resource planning \(ERP\ystems. Data cannot be transmitted from one department to another. Warehouse managers cannot access the quality data from other departments. Hence, a central data warehouse is needed in the company Figure 8 - Some Examples of Parameters in the SLAP Experiment of R-FSAS In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methodology, a supplier delivery order is chosen and inputted into the R-FSAS. It is assumed that the purchasing department has ordered the raw materials from a supplier. The warehouse department receives the delivery order from the supplier. The no. of delivery order is 10032911. After the purchasing department enters the relevant data into the database by using RFID technology, the warehouse operators have to start to go through the procedure shown on the put-away decision tree. The warehouse operators can access the decision support data with the help of the Fuzzy Association Rule Container Module. They can get the critical information by selecting the storage location for that particular SKU, such as the loading length, loading width, loading height, loading weight and loading cube for that delivery order from the supplier Besides this, the warehouse operators can also view the decision support data including popularity, turnover, cube movement, pick density of the SKU for the storage location selection. These decision support data help the warehouse operators to select the most appropriate location \(golden zone silver zone or bronze zone\n order to select the tier level for the SKU, the warehouse operators have to know the loading height, loading length, loading width, loading weight , loading cube and loading value of that delivery order. These decision support data help the staff to choose the best tier level \(T1, T2 T3 or T4  


7 The fuzzy association rules extracted from the historical data will be stored in the Fuzzy Association Rule Container Module and used to suggest the put-away decisions for the case company. In the put-away decision, the fuzzy outputs need to be generated, i.e. storage location \(golden, silver or bronze zone and tier level \(tier 1, 2, 3 or 4\The parameters required to perform the put-away process are popularity, turnover, cube movement, pick density, loading height, loading length loading width, loading weight, loading cube and loading value The warehouse operators have to input these parameters into the fuzzy system to find out the best storage location and most suitable tier level for the delivery order V C ONCLUSION This research has proposed a hybrid technique that enjoys the advantages of RFID, fuzzy sets and association rule extraction to provide decision support functionality for improved warehouse management. The developed methodology is able to discover the hidden knowledge and in turn help with the strategic decision making process for solving storage location assignment problems. It also provides a way for firms to better understand the changing business landscape, while the main objective is to assist companies to achieve greater operational efficiency, more efficient managerial arrangements, greater end customer satisfaction and most importantly, superior overall company performance However, the disadvantage is that the proposed methodology may need much computational time to perform the tasks and a sound data collection and integration system has to be developed before the system can be implemented A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank the Research Office of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting the project R EFERENCES 1 G u J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
