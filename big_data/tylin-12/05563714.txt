The Framework  As can be deduced from the figure, we can make use of the argumentation system whenever the stakeholders cannot reach a consensus in deciding the performance scores. Figure 3 shows the criteria specific argumentation that takes place once the need for deriving performance scores through argumentation ar ises. Every alternative is scored against criteria in the decision matrix. The arguments are entered in to the system by the stakeholders target a specific criterion for an alternative. The argumentation input itself consists of four inputs i.e. the name of the stake holder, th e argument specification, the weight of the argument and the priority of the stakeholder The name of the stake holder specifies the identity of the person specifying the argument. The argument is a sentence in English language which portrays the views and opinions of the stakeholder. The weight of the argument represents the degree of attack or support of that argument for that criterion    Figure 4. Argumentation Input  Figure 4 demonstrates how the addition of an argument is handled in our present system. The input for Group Name and User Name  correspond to a specific user and his group. The rest of the entries i.e. priority and weight are the same as discussed previously. The terms  Alternative and Position are synonymous in the system  4.2. Multi-Criteria Argumentation Tree Structure  Table 1 shows a sample decision matrix in which various alternatives are evaluated agai nst different criterion. The scores specified in the decision matrix can be either  Easily Determined or Controversial  Figure 5 shows argumentation tree that will be developed for evaluation of subjective scores for the decision matrix in Table 1  Table 1. Sample Decision Matrix    Every criterion in Table 1 h as an alternative as a child node. A detailed argumentation tree is developed for this alternative. In this way, the arguments are stated targeting this very criterion. This pin-points the arguments being stated to the highlighted matter and can extract the finer details of the concerning issue  147 


     Figure 5. Sample Argumentation Tree  Using the above sample tree approach, we can evaluate the performance score of every alternative using the techniques of fuzzy association matrix to derive the impact of indirect arguments and aggregating the scores derived from the argumentation sub-tree with the weight of the criteria to derive the performance scores in the decision matrix  5. CASE STUDY  As a part of our investigation, we took a project which was being implemented at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department of Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla. The project served as an ideal platform for us to test our proposed technique because the issue involved a decision problem which was under review of concerned research team. The issue had certain evaluation criteria which were laid down by the team members themselves. Ever y criterion in the criterion set had a favorability factor or weight which represented the role that criteria played in deciding the winning alternative. We decided to use Analytical Hierarchy Process \(AHP\or prioritizing the criteria due to its wide use and acceptability. The alternatives to be evaluated were also proposed by the team members or more so; the stakeholders. The n ature of the issue involved selecting the most favorable alternative from the set of underlined alternatives. The alternative positions were first evaluated on the specified criteria. Each alternative was given a quantified value which indicated its degree of satisfaction  for the given criterion. This score was given by stakeholders after rigorous discussions and reviews. The values were then put in the decision matrix and the favorability of all the alternatives was calculated using the sum of products of the weights of criteria and the score of an alternative with respect to that criteria. The alternative with the highest favorability score was selected. The following sections describe th e steps taken to resolve the issue for this research project  5.1 Description  The artifacts presented at the time of decision making were; the issue, the criterion set, a set of alternatives and concerned stakeholders. The subsections describe how and why the artifacts were important for decision making  5.1.1. The Issue The issue deals with selecting a suitable software platform for developing a Mine Detection Training Software The development of mine detection training tool is a research project supported by the US army. The project deals with simulating the real world conditions while detecting mines; into a system which could be used for training purposes. The development of this kind of a simulated tool has a lot of advantage over the previously developed systems. The systems already present for mine detection and training purposes are ve ry basic and do not have much flexibility in terms of customization. The simulated environment for such an environment will require an efficient software tool which can display the performance of a trainee on a real time basis. The system will also support some very important functionalities like recognizing different intensities of sound generation on identification of different kinds of mines, a control panel for customizing the simulated mine field and generation of reports showing quantitative summary performance in terms of coverage rate statistics, covered area statistics and mine target location   5.1.2. The Stakeholders The stakeholders involved in the decision process are two students from the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department  who are responsible for developing the sound d etection algorithm. Another stakeholder is a Computer Science  student responsible for developing the software t ool. This software tool will help the trainer evaluate a traineeês performance with respect to functionalities defined above. Two professors one from Computer Science and another from Mechanical Engineering department act as stakeholders responsible 148 


   for overlooking the overall software development process and playing a crucial role in making important decisions  5.1.3. The Criterion Set As stated earlier, criterion is the attribute for which favorability of an alternativ e is calculated. The criterion set defined for this case study comprises of Reusability  Meeting Operational Requirements and Meeting Project Deadline By reusability, we mean, the amount of reuse of different functionalities that ca n be achieved from the previously developed system on Mine detection training tool. Meeting operational requirements implies how effectively a desired operational capability can be satisfied by an alternative. For example, some alternative might lack a certain operational capability like database support whereas another may support it with enhanced features. Meeting project deadline stresses on the fact whether the project requirements can be satisfactorily achieved within the stipulated deadline which in our case was around one year  5.1.4. The Alternatives To resolve the concerned issu e, the stakeholders decided to choose one software platfor m for developing the mine detection training tool among the three stated alternatives Adobe Director  Adobe Flash  Open GL were chosen as the three possible alternatives along with some justifications. Adobe Flash was chosen as one of the alternatives because; the stakeholders already had a previous developed system for mine detection developed using Adobe Flash    Figure 6. Mine Detection System Along With Three Alternatives One of the considerations involved here was to enhance this system rather than develop a new system from scratch. Same reason applied to choosing Adobe Director as one of the other alternatives. Open GL was picked up as one of the three alternatives in the case when a new development had to be started Open GL is an advanced software development platform and it could have served as a good platform for the mine detection training system  Figure 6 summarizes the pro ject and its three alternatives positions available  5.2. Prioritizing The Criteria  For an effective decision making, we had to weigh the criteria according to their im portance in the decision making process. For this, we choose Analytic Hierarchy process because of its effectiveness in performing pair wise comparison of elements .Table 2 shows the ranking table used for comparing the two criteria  Table 2. Criteria Comp arison Table For AHP  Value a ij  Comparison Description 1 Criteria i and j are of equal importance 3 Criteria i is weakly more important than j 5 Criteria i is strongly more important than j 7 Criteria i is very strongly more important than j 9 Criteria i is absolutely more important than j   Table 3. Comparison Values For Prioritizing Different Criteria   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 1 1/5 3 Meeting Operational Requirements 5  1  7 Meeting Project Deadline  1/3 1/7  1   149 


   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels èAê, èBê, èCê for alternative çAdobe flashé, çAdobe Directoré and çOpen GLé respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholderês priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
