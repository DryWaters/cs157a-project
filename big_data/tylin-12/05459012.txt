Apriori algorithm is typical Boolean algorithm for mining association rules, which uses the method of iteration to create high-dimensional frequent item sets through low-dimensional ones. This paper introduces the 
design methods and technology realization of association rule mining by Apriori algorithm in technical action of ball games after a simple description of ball scripting language design method. Then take the association rule mining on table tennis technical and tactical analysis system as an example  That gives the further evidence of the effe ctiveness of Apriori algorithm  And  resolve the problem of association rule mining on technical movement of ball games Keywords-Data mining; Association rules; Apriori algorithm Technical action analysis  I  
 I NTRODUCTION   Ball game is an important component part in the field of competitive sports. The field of competitive sports has accumulated a large amount of data. At present, The analysis on these data uses statistical methods. Sports statistics mainly use the statistical principles and methods 1 The disadvantage of statistical methods is random sampling. It will lost useful information, and do not have good results for dealing with large amounts of data. In addition, most of the statistical analysis techniques are on the basis of perfect mathematical theory and lofty technique so it requires high performance for users 2 Analyze the data in the area of competitive sports by using Data Mining 
technique ,discover the important information easily be overlooked and help coaches make the right judgments have became a new challenge on the road of sports information One main feature of ball games is the relationship of technical movements. So association rule mining has became an important part of analysis of ball games. At present, ball association rules mining are mainly focused on application of Apriori Algorithm According to the concept of support, it analyses the correlate of actions users specify but has not formed a wide range of association rule mining This paper adopts Apriori algor ithm to analyze match data on the basis of information collection of ball games resolves the problem of association rule mining on technical movements of ball games, and achieves the purpose of 
assisting coaches with decision-making II  SCRIPTING  COLLECTION  METHOD  OF  BALL  GAMES Balls mentioned in this paper include volleyball, table tennis and basketball. In this paper, association rule mining is on the basis of data collection of ball games, so the description and collection me thods of ball scripting language must be designed. The common feature of ball scripting description language is that the language must can descript the process of games, so the collection method of ball games is based on process. That requires designing a variety of ball scripting language according to the characteristics of technical movement and games Ball scripting description language is defined in the 
analysis system. The collection technique is based on technical movements coding, which collect the technical movements athletes actually use into computer, according to technical movement encoding rules. Coding uses the form of four yards, and is separated by dots. Below take the table tennis as an example to illustrate the design method of scripting description language and the design method of scripting collection. The scripting language definition of table tennis and basketball, and scripting collection adopt similar design approach. This paper does not elaborate on that The scripting coding rule of table tennis includes hitting approaches, hitting effects, technical movements and where the ball is, among which, hitting approaches are classified into fifteen kinds, that is active forehand oblique line\(Z

According to the above codi ng rule, a round of table tennis competition  active forehand oblique line downward swirling near net 16 active backhand oblique line chop far away from table 61 active backhand oblique line loop drive far away from table 12 active backhand oblique line block down the net 20 score  can be described as  zx16.fc61.fh12.fd20  III  DESIGN  OF  APPRIORI  ALGORITHM  IN  ANALYSE  OF  BALL  TECHNICAL  MOVEMENTS Apriori algorithm is a basic algorithm to find frequent item sets 3 In acquisition and analysis system of ball games collect match data according to the collection method of scripting language. In the database, a round of the competition is stored as a record. The design goal of Apriori is to form an association rule mining middleware. Thorough iteration, it searches out all frequent item sets of the transaction database to lay the foundation for generating association rules  A  Design of Transaction Database Table Transaction data sets is th e direct data source of association rule mining 4 Boolean association rule mining is based on transaction database. Transaction table is generated on the basis of processing the data in relational database of ball games. The relational database of ball games includes match information table and scripting information table. They build relationships through match number. Transaction table take technical movements of table tennis as fields Data processing mainly uses the method of separation Separate the scripting records by dots, subtract zones, just leave match actions ,gain and loss mark. Then extract all actions of the member to be analyzed. In accordance with considerations of boolean asso ciation rules, assign 1 on the corresponding action code field position of the transaction table B  Algorithm Design Agrawal firstly proposed the association rule mining problem among item sets of custom transaction database in 1993 5 Apriori algorithm finds all frequent item sets of transaction database through recursion.Firstly,generate frequent 1-item sets L 1 then generate frequent 2-item sets L 2 until there is some value ,which makes L is empty algorithm stops. In the k iteratio n, firstly generate candidate k-item set C k the scan database to calculate the support count of every item set, reserve the item sets to form frequent k-item sets. Their suppor t is greater than or equal to the minimum degree of support. In which, C k need two steps to generate 1 joining. Every item set is generated by joining two item sets of L k-1 The two item sets must meet the following requirements. Their previous k-2\ms are the same, and the \(k-1\m is different from each other 2 pruning. Any non-empty subset of a frequent item sets is frequent item sets, so after joining, it need delete the frequent item sets, which have non-frequent subset. That is pruning 6  The pseudocode 7 of Apriori algorithm is as follows L 1 find_frequent_1-itemsets\(D  for\(k=2 L k-1 k C k  apriori_gen L k-1 min_sup  for each transaction t D{//scan D for counts C t subset\(C k t  for each candidate c C t  c. count   L k c C k c. count min_sup  return L k L k  prodedure apriori _ gen L k-1 frequent\(k-1\- itemsets min_sup : minimu  m support threshold for each itemset l 1 L k-1  for each itemset l 2 L k-1 if\(l 1 1]=l 2 1 l 1 2]=l 2 2   l 1 k-2 2 k2 l 1 k-1 2 k-1 en   c=l 1 l 2 join step:generate candidates if has_infrequent_subset c,L k-1 en delete c else add c to C k   return C k  procedure has_infrequent_subset c:candidate k-itemset L k-1 frequent\(k-1\itemset for each \(k-1\subset s of c if s L k-1 then return TRUE return FALSE IV  CASE ANALYSIS  In this paper, Apriori algorithm middleware has been applied in the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system, and achieved good result. It gives the maximum support for the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system A  Data Preprocessing This paper chooses three games of Wang Hao, china table tennis team members as analysis object of mining association rules. Extract match code from table tennis relational database. The data format is zx16 fc61. fh12 fd20 That is the description of a round of competition Now, separate the code, the se paration steps are as follows 1 Firstly, separate the code, subtract zones, just leave math actions , gain and loss score. Separate the above code then get the action ZX,FC,FH and FD 2 Check out whether the member to be analyzed is serving side. If he is, extract his actions from the first action and then extract interval action until the record is end. If he is not, extract his actions from the second action, then extract interval action until the record is end 3 After separating, assign 1 on the corresponding action code field position of the transaction table

B  Mining Frequent Item Sets In order to find high confidence association rules in a large range, we set lower minimum support threshold Suppose the minimum support threshold is 1%,minmum confidence level threshold is 40%.This paper mines association rules among three games of Wang Hao, a total of 352 valid data by using Apriori algorithm middleware. In order to unify abbreviations, code gain score as GO and loss score as LO. The specific process is as follows 1 Read record data into vector container 2 Count every word in the vector container, and store the word and its number into another vector container 3 Every word is a member of candidate 1-item set C 1 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 1-item set,and be sotred into frequent 1-item sets vector container.The process of generating frequent 1-item sets is as figure 2.Because the candidate item sets and frequent item sets are large enough,this paper can not enumerate 4 Join L 1 L 1 L 1 and generate candidate 2-item sets C 2 Count every word of C 2 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 2-item set,and be sotred into frequent 2item sets vector container 5 Join L 2 L 2 L 2 and generate candidate 3-item sets C 3  Count every word of C 3 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 3-item set,and be sotred into frequent 3item sets vector container 6 Join L 3 and generate candidate 4-item sets C 4 C 4 is null. End Figure 2.Generate frequent 1-item sets by candidate 1-item sets C  Generate Association Rules The association rules of transaction database is to find the relationship among item sets 8 Strong association rules meet the minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold. Find frequent item sets from database D, then generate strong association rules.The process is as follows 2  1 For every frequent item set l, generate its all nonempty subsets 2 For a non-empty subset s of l, if  conf s count port l count port min_   _ sup   _ sup put out the rules  s=>\(ls   In which, min_conf is minimum confidence threshold Figure 3 is the association rule mining result  Figure 3.Association rule mining result D  Result Analysis Analyze the association rule mining results of math data of Wang Hao,we can get that his forehand and backhand are both skilled.His main score point is attacking ball  in combination with loop drive and fast band  Coaches should be thinking about is that how to combine with fast band loop drive ,attacking ball to in crease the probability score Wang Hao  s main losing score point is defense. How to reduce defense losing score is also an important problem But in the mining results, there are still unreasonable association rules. That is unavoidable. However, how to delete the unreasonable associa tion rules to increase the correctness of mining results is to be resolved V  CONCLUSION In this paper, the solution and realization scheme for association rule mining on analysis system of ball matches by Apriori algorithm is proposed. A Apriori algorithm middleware is realized, and it has been verified in the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system, achieved the expected purpose. The associa tion rule analysis is more universal than that between specified actions. Coaches can observe association rules to find hidden information. But how to increase the correctness of mining results is to be resolved. At present, in order to find a suitable threshold to analyze the association rules, coaches can only set different levels of support threshold and confidence threshold to observe the changes in association rules R EFERENCES  1  Quan Deqing,Cheng Zhiping.Statistics Disciplines of Sports and Development Trend[J J o u r n al o f XI A N P h y s ical E d uc at io n  University.2008.25\(1

to decide two codewords will be modied to c0 or c255 Thus the codeword with the minimum MSE value between c0 and the codeword itself will be changed to c0 Similarly the codeword with the minimum MSE value between c255 and the codeword itself will be changed to c255 Besides since the codebook applied in our method is grayscale the extracted watermark will be in grayscale form However in order to make objective comparisons between our approach and the e xtracted grayscale w atermark will be polarized That is the pixels with values larger than or equivalent to 128 will be reset to 255 and the pixels with values smaller than 128 will be reset to 0 respectively Fig 2 shows watermarked images and the corresponding extracted watermarks of the proposed method Table I shows that the value of PSNR of watermarked images with different sizes of watermarks in the proposed method is greater than the value of PSNR of watermarked images in Shen and Ren method It means that the watermarked image of our proposed method have better image quality Since NC value can be anywhere between 0 and 1 The closer the NC value is to 1 the higher the accuracy is for the extracted watermark So the extracted watermark of our proposed method is more accuracy than the extracted watermark of Shen and Rens method Also the well-known image processing software Photoshop is applied to perform 32 image attacks including JPEG lossy compression quality level 0 1 2 12 sharpening 1-3 times adding in Gaussian noise   2,4,6,8 10 15 and 20 blurring 1-3 times and 6 kinds of cropping methods on the watermark images Then NC is used to compare the difference between the original watermark and the extracted watermark After applying 6 kinds of cropping attacks JPEG lossy compression quality level  0 sharpening three times adding in Gaussian noise    20 and blurring three times to watermarked images of the proposed method and Shen and Rens method we can obtain the corresponding extracted watermarks Table II shows that no matter which kinds of attacks the watermarked images suffer from extracted watermarks are still similar with the watermark extracted from non-attacked watermarked image Moreover NC values calculated from extracted watermarks using the proposed method outperform Shen and Rens method especially in case of Gaussian noise and blurring Table I PSNR OF WATERMARKING IMAGE AND NC OF ITS WATERMARK EXTRACTION  watermark PSNR NC PSNR NC Size proposed proposed Shen  Ren Shen  Ren method method method method 64  64 31.9998 0.9928 30.8683 0.9872 128  128 31.8379 0.9871 30.7539 0.9772 256  128 31.8379 0.9875 30.7493 0.9843 a 512  512 original image b 128  128 watermark c Watermarked image d Extracted watermark with PSNR  30.8466\(dB with NC  0.9948 Figure 3 Watermarking image and its watermark extraction Finally we use another 512  512 image Mandril and another watermark to emphasis that the proposed method can be easily applied in different kinds of protected images Figs 3\(a and 3\(b are the original images 128  128 watermark Figs 3\(c is the corresponding watermarked image It is noticed that PSNR values of the watermarked image is smaller than watermarked image Lena since the codebook was trained using Lena only Figs 3\(d shows the extracted watermark Then we also apply the same image processings JPEG lossy compression quality level  0 sharpening three times adding in Gaussian noise    20 and blurring three times to the watermarked image we obtain the corresponding extracted watermarks and there NC values are shown in table III V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper a robust watermarking technique is proposed using vector quantization VQ and association rules 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 827

For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is Problem solving. Second in the ranking for students is Elementary computing skills. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second language and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with Personal skills rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by Professional skills, Interpersonal skills, Internationalisation and Entrepreneurship. The smallest mean Internationalisation is just over midway between weak and considerable. Given the European Unions desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by Personal sk ills and Interpersonal skills. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
