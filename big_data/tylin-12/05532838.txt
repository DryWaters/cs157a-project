  Abstract There are various algorithm for finding frequent itemsets one of them is the Association rule mining Association rule mining uses an algorithm called apriori to find frequent itemsets. But due to some limitations viz producing large number of candidate itemsets, which results in frequent database scanning while finding frequent itemsets. For solution of all these drawbacks, here new algorithm is introduced named, Modified RAAT \(Reduced Apriori Algorithm using Tag\. Modified RAAT is more efficient because it performs reduction in database scan time 
by using a special feature named Tag parameter, A Tag parameter includes three more parameters: minimum maximum and total number of items in a particular transaction. One can conclude  the following by Comparing this Tag value with a transaction containing particular itemset, Mismatching of the parameters requires no further usage of that transaction. By counting the change in support parameter the Modified RAAT algorithm may also find various emerging patterns like JEP \(jumping emerging pattern\he pattern whose support changes abruptly from zero to nonzero is classified as JEP. This concept is designed 
by using border-based approach to find most expressive JEP  Keywords EP, JEP, Modified RAAT  I. I NTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is one of the interesting areas of Data Mining. Association rule mining finds the interesting or correlation relationship among a large set of data items E.g. The market basket problem assumes we have some large number of items e.g. “bread” ,”butter”. Customer fills their market basket with some subset of the items n we get to know what items people buy together, even if we don’t know 
w h o th e y are. Mark eters u s e th is i n f o r m atio n to p o s itio n  items and control the way a typical customer traverses the store. For example in practical usage we can consider it as following   A. Baskets = documents, items = words. Words appearing frequently together in documents may represent phrase or linked conception. And can be used for intelligence gathering B. Baskets = sentences; items= documents. Two documents with many of the same sentences could represent plagiarism or mirror sites on web  II.

C ONCLUSION  Apriori and RAAT \(Reduced Apriori Algorithm using Tag\ has the drawback of large number of candidate itemset generation. So as further improvement Modified RAAT \(Reduced Apriori Algorithm using Tag\ is proposed here. This algorithm is proposed to improve efficiency for more than 2-candidate itemsets by using modified Tag parameter. Modified tag parameter includes three arguments \(minimum number, maximum number total number of items\or particular transaction. With the decrease of minimum support to some content, the Improved Apriori algorithm tends to prevail; and with the further decrease of minimum support, the advantage of the Improved Apriori algorithm can be greatly enhanced  R EFERENCES  1  Lei Ji, Baowen Zhang, Jianhua Li, “A New Improvement on Apriori Algorithm”, International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security, Vol-1, pp 84-844, Nov 2006 2  Yiwu  Xie, Yutong Li, Chunli Wang, Mingyu Lu, “The Optimization and Improvement of the Apriori Algorithm Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops, 2008 IITAW '08, pp 1101 – 1103, Dec. 2008

400 BE 30 500 ABC 400, 50 It is found that frequent item sets do not have temporal factor. The search proc ess is listed as  First enumerate all items The numbers of A B C D E are 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively  Second generate the frequent 1-item set according to support enough and give numbers to frequent itemset Assume that the support enough is 2 the frequent 1-item set are expressed as 1 2 3 4 and 5 Correspondingly the numbers of BV 1  BV 2 BV 3 andBV 5  are 1010 0111 1110 and 0111 respectively  Third create a relationship graph that shows the relationships among items in frequent 1-item set and then generate frequent 2item set  Fourth create a searching frequent 3item set During this process we determine the execution state of algorithm because the count of items in frequent 2-item set is 4 which is larger than 3 and the number of the node of which the degree is larger than 2 is 3 it is larger than 3 So the algorithm continues execution Finally We travel the list T of candidate frequent itemset to get the tuple 2,3,5 in which x=3 This item can be used to construct a complete graph At the same time we check out the BV 2 BV 3 BV 5  the count of number 1 in the result is less than support enough so it is a frequent itemset  Fifth the count of the element in frequent 3-item set is 1 which is less than 4 resulting in the termination of the algorithm Check out whether the valid-time attribute of all frequent items meet each other by making use of the technologies of time-interval expansion and mergence let support=2 then scan the database The checkout result is that 1 2 3 5 1,3 2,3 2,5 3,5 and 2,3,5 These all meet temporal constraints of frequent items Generate temporal rules by combining confidence enough with the frequent items obtained above performance evaluation When the Apriori algorithm searches frequent nitemset in frequent n-1 item set it firstly takes joint and pruning operations to construct candidate frequent itemset C K The joint operation will be executed C S 2 times and the pruning operation will be implemented K. C S 2 times The intermediary result S is the count of candidate frequent itemset Let the time complexity of executing comparative operation be O\(t The complexity of the algorithm is dependent upon the O\(t order frequent set Assuming that there are 10-thousand frequent 1-item set the Apriori algorithm will produce more than ten-million frequent 2item sets If we want search frequent schemas whose length is 100 it will require 1030 candidate frequent itemset which will reduce the efficiency of Apriori algorithm Also the number of the elements in the candidate frequent itemset is greatly decreased For instance the frequent 2item sets in this example are 1,3 2,3 2,5 and 3,5 From the time-space complexity point of view the performance of the algorithm is better 6  C Proposed Fuzzy AprioriTid for an encoded dynamic database Fuzzy set theory is being used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning Therefore to use fuzzy sets in data mining a mining approach that integrates fuzzy set concepts with The AprioriTid mining algorithm has been identified It finds interesting itemsets and fuzzy association rules in transaction data with quantitative values The role of fuzzy sets helps transform quantitativ e values into linguistic terms which reduces possible itemsets in the mining process They are used in the AprioriTid data mining algorithm to discover useful association rules from quantitative values The fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set with linguistic terms using membership functions The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all transaction data using the temporary set Each attribute uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes which keeps the number of items the same as that of the original attributes The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules IV P ERFORMANCE AND E VALUATION The anti-Apriori algorit hm in combination with the encoding method decreases the siz e of the database and also leads to reduction in the number of passes over the static database The performance of AprioriHybrid relative to Apriori and AprioriTid for large datasets is as follows AprioriHybrid performs better than Apriori in almost all cases In general the advantage of AprioriHybrid over Apriori depends on the size of the candidate itemset that declines in the later passes If there is a gradual decline in the size AprioriTid can be used for a while after the switch and a significant improvement can be obtained in the execution time By using this encoding method the efficiency of Apriori AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid has improved significantly The use of Apriori and anti-Apriori algorithm combined with an encoding method for association rule mining in a temporal database has been experimented on complaints database The encoding method reduced the size of the database which is depicted by figure1 The use of antiApriori on databases with time constraints reduced the number of scans over a temporal database 


Figure1: Effect of encoding Database encoding has been applied to a static database before applying Apriori or anti Apriori To make it scalable the same is applied to a dynamic database which involves time constraints The fuzzy AprioriTid mining approach has been found to reduce the computational time involved Figure2 shows the performance of these approaches in terms of time Figure2 Performance comparison V C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper studied the impact of the Apriori family of algorithms on an encoded database for association rule mining Each of the algorithms has a different impact and produces effective results Th e effect of Apriori and antiApriori algorithms on a temporal data base which has been encoded by an encoding method provided advantageous results in terms of lower complexities of time and space The graph mining method has been found to involve less execution time The fuzzy approach to data mining has been found to be good enough to provide reduction in computation time As future work t he discovery of association rules may be used to allow the user of a knowledge discovery system to observe the changes and fluctuations in the rules which could be considered as an enhancement It may also possible to observe the seasonal or cyclical changes and fluctuations in the rules R EFERENCES 1 A bdu lla h U z T ansel  Susan P  I m berman Discovery of Association Rules in Temporal Databases International Conference on Information Technology 2007 2 T ong W a n g Pi-Li a n H e Data b a se Encod i n g a nd an Anti-Apriori Algorithm for association Rules Mining Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Machine learning and Cybernetics August 2006 3 M a r ga re t H D u nha m  Da ta M i n i n g I ntr o d u c t or y and Advanced Topics Tsinghua University Press Beijing 2003 4 H u i Ning  H ai fen g Yu an Shu g ang Ch en  T e m pora l Association Rules in Mining Method Proceedings of the First International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences 2006  R  A g r a w al R  S rikant Fast a l g o r ithm s for M i n in g Association Rules Proceedings of the 20 th International Conference on Very Large Databases September 1994  Show-Jane Yen Arb e e L P C hen A Graph Base d Approach for Discovering Various Types of Association Rules IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data Engineering Vol.13 No.5 September/October 2001 7 T zungP e i Hong C h an-Sheng Kuo Shyue-Liang Wang a Fuzzy AprioriTid mining algorithm with reduced computational time Tenth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 2004 


  41  partitions of variable sizes, each partition will be called a cluster.  Each cluster is consid ered one at a time by loading the first cluster into memory and calculating large itemsets and the corresponding support counts. Then the second cluster is considered similarly and the cumulative support count is calculated for the cumulative large itemsets. This process is continued for the entire set of clusters and finally we have the whole large itemsets and the corresponding cumulative support counts.  This approach reduces main memory requirement since it considers only a small cluster at a time and hence it is scalable for any large size of the database Experiments using two of the standard transaction databases available on the Internet, T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K, show that CGAR outperforms Apriori, a familiar and widely used association rule mining algorithm When there is a reduction in the value of the minimum support threshold, the performance gap between the algorithms becomes more evident References 1 uhJ i u a n T s ay J i un nY a n n Ch ia ng C B A R  an e f f i cie n t m e t h o d f o r  mining association rules, Knowledge-Based Systems 18 \(2005\105 2 R A g r a w a l  T   I m il ie ns ki, A  S w am i Mi ni ng as s o cia t io n r u l e s be tw e e n s e ts  of items in large databases, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Washington, DC, 1993 pp. 207–216 3  A y s e Oz el and H  A l tay  G venir  A n A l g o r ithm f o r Mi ni ng A s s o ciati o n  Rules Using Perfect Hashing and Database Pruning, \(2000  4  A g ra w a l R  S r ik ant   M i ni n g s e q u e nt ia l pa tt ern s  P r oc eed in gs of th e 11 th  International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE\, 1995 5 F  B e rz a l  J C  C u b e ro N M a rin   J M  Se rra n o  T B A R a n e ffi c i e n t me th od for association rule mining in relational databases, Elserier Data and Knowledge, Engineering 37 \(2001\ 47–64 6   Br i n R  Mo tw an i C.

 F  To check the validity of association rules  E quatio n  1  is use d  as  it is done i n  th e  last column of  Figur e  7   G  Select one  of th e  rules which have Improvement  value more than   1     H  In case if there is another job asking to get the files  and the s e files are available in the same sites then  choose another rule to serve the new request  Otherwise  apply  Aprior i  algorithm for recent STTs  of  new replicas sites    VI I   I NTERPRETING THE  R ESULT S    This section means to explain how the association  rul e s work better than the traditional and random methods  As it is shown in  Figure 7 after applying  Aprior i  algorithm  we get  602  different rules which can be used to select the  best combination of replica sites   Let us explain Figure 7  in details    Rule #1: if Site\(s S 4  S 7  are selected then this implies  that site\(s S 3  can also be selected at the same time. This  rule has 100% confidence    In other words, it means if site  S 4   and  S 7  are selected to  work together to transfer the requested files, t h en this  implies site\(s  S 3  can also be selected to share the work at  the same time. This rule has confidence  100  This  particular rule has  confidence  of  100  meaning that  S 4  S 7   and  S 3  can be selected as a best set of replicas by  Replica  Manage r  to ge t  requested files. To compute the correlation  of this rule and see how far it is better than choosing the site  randomly, we use an Improvement equation     indicates that it has support of  26  transactions, meaning that in transaction  Single Trip  Time  Table  there are  2 6  concurrent uncongested trips of  S 4  S 7   i.e. these sites have similar network conditions in particular  time      indicates the total number of transactions  involving uncongested trips of  S 3   in  Rule 1  is equal to  174    This is a piece of a side information; it is not involved  in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself       is the number of transactions where   S 4   S 7 as well as   S 3 has uncongested trips. In  Rule 1  it is equal  to  2 6       or   indicates how much  more likely we are to encounter  S 4  and  S 6  transaction if we  consider just those transactions where  S 3  S 5 and  S 8  have  uncongested trips. As compared to the entire population of  the transactions, it's t h e  confidenc e  divided by  support \(c   where the latter is expressed as a percentage   For  Rule 1 the  confidenc e is  100   support \(c  in  percentage   174/194\*100 = 89.6 9 So, th e    Lift ratio = 100/89.69.1 = 1.1   As it is clearly shown in  Figure 7  some r u les with  an improvement value less than one means this is an  unreliable rule. Whereas the rule with a value more than one  means this rule is better than random replica selection with  number of time equal to improvement value as it is shown in  Figure 8                   When improvement value is more than 1 it is better to use  EST to select replica sites, because it selects the sites able to  work simultaneously    I n  Figure  9  we sho w  the  comparison between EST and  traditional model using highest bandwidth a s  a criterion to  select the best replica. As we can observe our technique has  a better performance most of the times because it selects the  sites which have the stable links. In traditional method the  site which has the highest bandwidth does not always me a n  to be the best because sometimes this highest bandwidth  link can be congeste d   Let us declare more by the following  scenario  o f  Figure 1 0 suppose   S 0   be the computing site  and let   S 1  S 3   S 1 4   be replica sites  Red stars referring to  congested router s   Using traditional selection method the  file will be got from S14 since it has less number of Hops  routers\ and highest and also has highest bandwidth link         Figure 8.

               Using  ES T the replica   S 3    is selected as a best replica  because the link b etween  C S  and  R S  is uncongested     VII I   C ONCLUSIO N  In this paper we presented a dynamic replica  selection strategy that aims to adapt at ru n time its criteria to  flexible QoS binding contracts specified by the service  provider and/or the client. The adapta b ility feature  addressed by our replica selection strategy is inferred from  the observation that the basic metrics, which influence the  QoS that the user perceives when accessing a replica  depend directly on the application being replicated and on  the cli e nts\222 preferences. To reach this objective that, we  used   the concept of association rules of data mining  approach to the most stable links sites in order to reduce the  searching space the response time and network resources  consumed    A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S  Au t hors wish to express their sincere thanks to  Prof. Arun Agarwal, from GridLabs Department of  Computer and Information Sciences, University of  Hyderabad, India for providing all the infrastructural and  computational support required to carry out this work  His  academic suggestions to improve the quality of the work are  also highly appreciated and acknowledged   R EFERENCE S     M  Rashedur Rahma n   Ken Barke r   Reda Alhaj j    Replica  selection in grid environment:a dat a mining approac h    Distributed systems and grid computing \(DSGC\,pp: 695  226  700  2005    J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
