The former 
focuses on finding regularities in data trends, while the latter on discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions and patterns in the underlying data. Several research attempts have been made for the purpose of clustering transactions based on the binary data space. In this paper, an algorithm has been proposed for the same purpose but based on the non-binary data space. We also propose a novel mechanism to yield weighted association rules in non-binary search space. It is capable of clustering and mining weighted association rules more close to the real life situations as it considers the Strength of Presence of each item implicitly. Also they can be directly applied to the real time data repository 
 Keywords Data Mining, Association Rule Induction Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Non-Binary Search Space  1 Introduction  The Internet, fast computers and inexpensive storage in the recent days has lead to a widespread collection of data from a variety of sources and of a variety of types. A question often posed about these data is: Can we find something interesting that we did not already know? i.e can this large amount of data become knowledge or information? Data mining is a concept used hugely now days for the purpose of data explosion and knowledge 
discovery from the large dataset. Further, due to its applicability in diverse domains such as engineering business and social sciences, it has been a subject of wide research Association Rule Induction and Clustering are some of the most useful data mining techniques. The former focuses on finding regularities in data trends [1 w h ile t h e latter on discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions and patterns in the underlying data  Association Rule Induction has two different phases; first is to find the frequent itemsets and the second is to find the rules from these itemsets. An association rule 
expresses an association between items or sets of items Finding these rules is valuable for cross marketing analysis, attached mailing applications, store layout customer segmentation based on buying patterns etc. The algorithms for mining frequent patterns can be classified into two approaches, namely, candidate generation e.g the Apriori algorithm and like algorithms [3 d p a ttern growth e.g. FP-growth algorithm ecen t res earc h  includes NB Frequent Itemset algorithm [5  w h i c h focuses on mining association rules from non-binary dataset, with the consideration of Strength of Presence or 
Weight of each item Weighted Association Rules are association rules with weights or Strength of Presence. The weights associated with the items signify importance of the items. It not only improves the confidence in the rules, but also provides a mechanism to do effective target marketing by identifying or segmenting customers based on their potential, degree of loyalty or volume of purchase. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. The model WAR considers whether an item is present in a transaction or not. But, it does not take into account the weight or Strength of Presence of an item within a transaction. Also 
in WAR, frequent itemsets are found by ignoring the weights but these weights are associated during the generation of association rules. Feng Ta  addresses the issues of discovering significant binary relationships involving items with significant weights rather than being flooded in the combinatorial explosion of insignificant relationships in transaction datasets in a weighted setting. Rahman et. al a v e propos ed a  Count distribution algorithm that considers only the support of the item and its significance to generated closed frequent itemsets. By considering the significance of the item, they prevent the loss of important items 
whose support may be less than the minimum support provided by the user because of its durability. Even though generating weighted association rules have been a topic of research, none of the algorithms proposed have clear bounds on generating these rules directly from non binary search space nor has the concept of Dynamic Support w h i c h f o r m s t h e bas i s of as s o ci at i o n ru l e  induction in non-binary search space, been considered On the other hand, the goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabeled data

It involves partitioning of a given data set into groups or clusters such that the data points in one cluster are more similar to each other than the data points in different clusters. Clustering Algorithms normally use distance based measurement in order to classify or group objects Some modern applications of clustering include clustering the web, clustering search results, customer segmentation recommender systems and community discovery in social networks. Due to its recent ubiquitous applicability, the field of clustering has undergone major revolution over the last few decades. Partitioning algorithms like kmedoi L A R A  Fu zz y k m e doi d [10] et c   hierarchical clustering algorithms like DBSCAN  BIRCH d categori cal clustering algorithms like ROCK T IR R 14] et c., prov i d e s a t i s f act or y  result in clustering numerical as well as categorical data respectively Arunava et al  a v e propos ed a rou g h  set based clustering approach to cluster imprecise transactions in the presence of heterogeneous and hierarchical taxonomy of products. This diversity of the clustering algorithms is due to the diversity of induction principle models Although several approaches have been proposed for clustering transaction data none of these solutions have clear bounds for clustering transactions from non-binary data sets and grouping transactions hierarchically. Binary dataset representation gives information about an item being present or not in the search space, but does not provide any information about the strength of its presence which can be more effective in forming clusters close to real life situations A s a n  ex a m ple, 10 un it s o f Ite m  A   10 units of item B and 10 units of Item A, 1 units of item B could not be differentiated in Binary Search Space Hence, it cannot model real time situations as it does not provide any clue regarding the strength of presence of items being processed Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that yield hierarchy of clusters for transactions from non-binary datasets and hence, yields clusters directly from the real time data repository. We also, as a consequence of e n e rate  w e i g hted as s o ciation rules   Further, the Strength of Presence associated with the transactions, apart from generating more accurate weighted associations, which are close to real life situation, also improves the quality of clustering. Last but not the least; it eliminates noisy transactions from the transaction database. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Definitions and Support Calculations for NonBinary Search Space are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 outlines a mechanism for weighted association rule induction. In Section 4, we present the proposed NB Cluster algorithm with detailed example. Conclusions and future works are mentioned in Section 5  2 Definitions and Support Calculation for Non – Binary Search Space  Let P = {p 1 p 2 p m  be the set of items. Let T = {t 1  t 2 t n  be the set of transactions where each transaction t i is a set of items such that t i  002 T Each transaction t i  contains a sub-set of items that has been processed and can be represented as a vector m im i i i p w p w p w t      2 2 1 1       1  Where w ij  implies Weight or Strength of Presence of item p j  which  has been processed in transaction t i  Also, weight is non-binary real value where the item has processed and is zero where it has not processed The non-binary weight quantifies the Strength of Presence of items in transaction vector. An example of non-binary data set is shown in Table 1, where p1  p2, p3  and p4 are the items t1  t2  t3  t4 and t5 are the transactions on the items and the corresponding cell value is representing the respective w ij   Table 1.

The support calculation for the proposed work is divided into two parts, \(i\he Dynamic Support   M L  for hierarchy level L is calculated using two factors firstly the average of scalar distances of all the transaction vectors from the origin in the n-dimensional space where n is the number of products and secondly standard deviation \(SD\f all such distances from the average scalar distances. The dynamic support needs to be calculated at each level in the hierarchy. For a specific set of transactions, dynamic support will group a subset of these transactions based on the interested strength of presence of the items, \(ii\the Static Support is the user defined threshold value which is a minimum count of transactions or a percentage of the total number of transactions that should be supported by a cluster at any level in the hierarchy for it to be considered valid. The sequence of dynamic support and static support calculation will be used to group the transactions at every level

Let the distance dist L i is distance of transaction vector t i correspond to i th  transaction and is calculated by using Equation-2 considering the origin as a reference Also, let SD be the standard deviation of all such distances. Now the dynamic support M L is the range defined by the boundary average scalar distance - SD average scalar distance+SD All transactions having interested strength of presence of the items corresponding to level L should be within the range defined by M L  Further M L can be represented as Equation-3 and given as follows  2 2 2 2 1    iL i i L w w w i dist      2 SD n i dist M n i L L   000       1 3  Table 2.

The SD of all distances is equal to 16.371. The Dynamic Support at Level 1 is M L  and is the range [18.356, 51.097 s i n g  Equ a t i o n 3.

Dynamic Support applied to Table 2 Transaction Set Count Transactions that contribute to count t1, t2, t3, t4 t5 3 t2, t3, t4  Now if Static Support is 3, then we can conclude that the Cluster {t1, t2, t3 is a valid cluster as it has interested strength of presence of the corresponding items in the non-binary search space      3 Generating Weighted Association Rules  3.1 Mechanism As the transactions are considered as vectors, the techniques of vector addition effectively yield the ideal transaction vector or resultant transaction vector for a given set of products for the transactions under consideration. It is computed by adding the corresponding weights of every transaction vectors and then dividing the sum of the weights by the number of transaction vectors under consideration. The idea l transaction vector, as the name suggests, is the representative transaction for the set of products under consideration  3.2 Example and Discussion  Consider a transaction set T contains m number of transactions in a market basket scenario and let I be the ideal vector corresponding to these transactions. So m  transaction of ideal vector I would lead to the same quantity of products being sold as the set T The weights associated with the products of the ideal transaction vector yields the weighted Association Rules. These rules not only indicate the probability of a product Y being brought along with another product X but also the ratio in which X and Y are brought. The immediate question that arises is that the ratio need not necessarily be followed by every customer transaction. But, this is countered by the fact that the ratio is an average value considering large number of transactions. As an example, say a person buys 1 liter of Milk and 250 grams of tea on a daily basis. Say on a fine day, he has guests. So, he would proportionately increase his purchase to, say, 5 liters of milk and 1.25 kg of tea for that day. As he buys 1 liter of Milk and 250 grams of tea on a daily basis, it can be said that the weighted association is ‘1 liter Milk  -> 0.25 Kg Tea’ and hence an increase or decrease in purchase of either of the commodities for a day or two becomes insignificant. On another day, it could so happen that he just buys 1 liter of milk without tea or vice versa as he has the commodity left over from the previous days. But considering over a long period of time, his Weighted Association Rule would remain unaltered As another example, in Table 1, consider p2, p3 and p2, p3, p4 as two frequent itemsets. For the frequent itemset p2, p3, p4 the ideal transaction vector, i.e., the weighted association rule is 15 p2 ->  9 p3 -> 16.8 p4  and for the frequent itemset p2, p3 the ideal transaction vector is 15 p2 -> 9 p3 They are obtained from the vector addition techniques mentioned above. To make things more clear, consider only transactions t1  t2 and t3 and the frequent itemset as p1, p4 So, the weighted association rule in this case is 20 p1 -> 8.67 p4 Please note that the frequent itemsets considered here are fictitious. We request the reader to refer to [5 h ere P r av een et. al, h a s  proposed an NB Frequent Itemset generation algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in non – binary search space 
240 


Hence, weighted Association Rules form the basis for prediction of the sale of a product as well as demand analysis in the future months. This information could be of at most importance to a market as it gives an idea of the amount of commodity to be purchased so as to minimize wastage as well shortage  4 Proposed NB Cluster Algorithm  4.1 The Algorithm  The main function NB_Cluster uses the function Check_Dynamic_Support and hierarchically clusters the transactions at each level from the non-binary search space. Initially, every transaction is considered as a cluster. These clusters are then agglomerated by the distance measures considering Static and Dynamic Support A medoid is computed for this cluster S L and is added to the transaction set T S To compute the medoid the average scalar distance of all transactions in the cluster is obtained in the n-dimensional space. A transaction having distance close to the average scalar distance is considered as the medoid and made as a new cluster. This cluster is considered, along with the other clusters that were not previously clustered, for clustering at the next higher level. The essence of adding the medoid is that the entire cluster S L is considered as a single transaction for clustering at the next higher level in the hierarchy. The function Check_Dynamic_Support is used to calculate the dynamic support for transaction set T S at every level in the hierarchy. The algorithm stops at a level L where the number of transaction in the cluster S L is less than the Static Support   L is level identification number, S L will store the interested transactions at level L and C  will store the clusters hierarchically  Function NB_Cluster Begin Initialize C  L 0 do begin Initialize count 0 S  Increment L  Count := Check_Dynamic_Support T S  If \(count >= static_support Begin  Add to the set S L  all those transactions that contributed to the count and remove them from T S  Add S L to C Calculate medoid of S L and add it to T S  end end while \( count >= static_support End  The function Check_dyanmic_support takes as input a set of transactions T S computes the corresponding distance mean and standard deviation and returns a count of the number of transactions in the range defined by mean and standard deviation  Function Check_Dynamic_Support transaction_set Ts M L will yield the range of dynamic support using Equation \(3 Compute dist L i for each transaction ti  corresponding transaction_set Ts  Compute the Standard deviation SD of all dist L i  corresponding to transaction_set Ts Compute M L at level L   for all i 0010  dist[i  do If dist[i is in the range defined by M L  Then increment count  Return count End Function  4.2 Examples  As proposed in the algorithm, clustering in the nonbinary search space with the concept of weight or strength of presence yields more accurate clusters from the given dataset and is directly applicable to the real time data repository. For example, consider a market basket scenario where a firm maps Product as an Item and a purchase session by some customer as a transaction to generate the clusters using the proposed algorithm. Now in the non-binary search space each transaction represents the set of weight values of the respective products purchased. The non-binary data set can be represented using the transaction-product matrix [Table-4   Let, the Static Support is set to 2 i.e 20 of the total number of customer transactions T S Now, at Level – 1 in the hierarchy, the algo rithm reads the dataset T S to compute the dynamic support [Table – 5  obt ai n s t h e transactions that satisfy the dynamic support and then uses the static support to determine the validity or density of the cluster. Therefore, corresponding to Level – 1 the cluster is S 1   t2, t6, t8, t9, t10 as shown in [Table   The transactions in S 1 are removed from T S and the medoid of S 1 which is t2 is added to T S Hence Ts t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t7

Dynamic Support applied to Table 4 Transaction Set Dynamic Support Count Transaction that contribute to Count t1, t2, t3, t4 t5, t7 110.531 413.30  3 t1, t2, t5  Therefore, it is clear from [Table at at Level - 2 in the hierarchy S 2 t1, t2 , t5}; Medoid of S 2 i.e. t5 is added to T S Now T S t3, t4, t5, t7  The algorithm proceeds in the same manner for levels higher up in the hierarchy and it eventually terminates at a level L at which the number of transactions in the cluster S L is lesser than the static support. In this case, the algorithm stops at level - 5  S 3 t3, t5 T S t3, t4, t7 S 4 t3, t7 T S t3, t4 Hence, the hierarchy of clusters for T S is as follows S := S 1  003 S 2  003 S 3  003 S 4  t2, t6, t8, t9, t10}, {t1, t2, t5}, {t3, t5}, {t3, t7      4.3 Discussion  The NB Clustering algorithm hierarchically clusters data from non-binary search space and so, it essentially removes the restriction in clustering data associated with binary dataset. The algorithm works in a bottom up manner calculating the support at each level, clustering the transaction and using the results to cluster transactions at the next higher level. A closer observation at the hierarchy indicates that as one move up the hierarchy, the density of the cluster decreases. This indicates that frequent transactions are at the cluster lower down in the hierarchy. Therefore, this clustering into hierarchies groups transactions according to frequency. This is possible as, in the proposed algorithm, we are considering the Strength of Presence of each item in the transaction to generate the cluster It is also interesting to note that the transaction t4 is not present in any cluster. So it is considered as a noisy transaction. This could be easily verified by having a look at t4 in  Table-4. The weights associated with it are much larger than the weights associated with other transactions These hierarchies filter the transactions form the large transaction database to the most frequent transactions, i.e they group only the most frequent transactions in a cluster and therefore effectively eliminate noisy transactions This is attributed to the nature of hierarchy of clusters Hence, better results can be obtained by mining association rules or weighted rules in these clusters than the entire transactional database Moreover the weighted association rules induction at different hierarchical levels yield a wide variety of rules that are in accordance to customer segmentation. As the proposed algorithm is using non-binary search space, it can be directly applied to the data repository and hence the accuracy of clustering increases. The worst case complexity of the algorithm is of the order of O\(m 2  where m is th number of transactions. The complexity is negligibly dependent on the hierarchy  5 Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper, a novel approach for mining weighted association rules over non-binary data set has been presented. In real life data analysis, predicting these rules with quantitative measure is a major concern and is the first step towards mining the association rules with broader objectives. Another contribution of this paper is the NB Cluster algorithm which yields hierarchy of clusters for data from non-binary search space and hence removes the restriction in clustering data associated with binary dataset. The density of cluster decreases as one moves higher up in the hierarchy. The Strength of Presence or Weight of each item considered while

generating the cluster not only yields more accurate clusters but is also advantageous as it is directly applicable to the real time data repository. Moreover, it effectively eliminates noisy transactions from the transaction database. The methodology used for this algorithm, also lead to a better way of calculating Support and hence provides new insights in non-binary data clustering Further studies will concentrate on testing the algorithm on real environment in order to prove its practical utility and in extending the algorithm for clustering transactions involving heterogeneous items in non-dataset  6 References  1 g ra w a l R I m ie lin sk i T  S w a m i A     M in in g  association rules between sets of items in large databases Intl.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
