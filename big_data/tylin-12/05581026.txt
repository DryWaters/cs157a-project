  CHINESE QUESTION CLASSIFICATION BASED ON MINING ASSOCIATION RULES YONG-LE SUN School of Computer and Communication Engineeri ng, Weifang University, Weifang 261061,China E-MAIL: sunny_bit@126.com Abstract In this paper, a method of Chinese question classification based on the mining association rule s is proposed. Words and Bi-gram are extracted from question as classific features. The method can mine the association rules betw een the type of the question and its classific features, to construct an association rules - based database. At last the type of the question is marked by choosing the type which the most association rules define Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and can achieve good performance Keywords Nature Language Processing Association rules; Question classification 1  Introduction With the rapid development of Internet, people find it more and more difficult to get their requirements by search engine. Traditional document retrieval searches relevant documents according to keywords which are provided by users, and the results is a long rank ed list of do cuments. The question answering system can give a correct and exact answer to a given question. So it has recently received much attention from natural language processing communities and it is one of the most important topic in TREC\( Text REtrieval Conference\A typical question answering system includes four modules: question analysis, search module, answer candidate extraction and answer selection. Question analysis module extracts keywords, classi fies question type and gives a kind of formal expression of a given question. Question classification system can sign one class to a given question based on the expected answer type. It could restrict the candidateês space of the answer according to the semantic category of the answer and could select the appropriate approach to extract the answer. So the precision of the question classification could affect the quality of question answering systems There are two kinds of ques tion classification method One was based on handcrafted rules [1  3 4 w h ich w a s used in the past years. By all appearances, its shortage is time-consuming and labor-intensive to get these rules. And it is difficult that hand-crafted rules which could work perfectly on a specific questions set are applied to another one Recently more and more question classification methods have been researched and applied which were based on statistical method and machine learning techniques, such as SVM 5    SN oW  9 10 Max im u m En t r op y Mod el [1 1   Modified Bayesian n d etc. Jun Suzukiês question classification system was based on SVM h  us ed HDAG kernel. Krystle Kocik[11 velope d a new a p proa ch to question classification, which in volved the application of statistical methods, namely Maximum Entropy models for classification. Yu Zhan troduced a modified Bayesian model to classify the Chinese question in open-domain answering system which wa s based on analysis of the Bayesian m proposed a m e thod of Chinese question classification based on ensemble learning which takes full use of the generalization feasibility of ensemble learning to improve the precision of the Chinese question classification  This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification based on association rules. It is organized as follows: section 2 presents the Chinese question classification taxonomy; section 3 describes Chinese question classification based on association rules; section 4 presents experimental results for questi on classification and finally section 5 conclude the paper 2  Chinese question taxonomy There are numerous question taxonomies which were defined according to question answering system. There are three kinds of QA \(question answering\EC definition task, factoid question ta sk and list question task. In this paper, we focus attention on factoid questions. In most of these question taxonomies, question types are defined according to the semantic viewpoint of the answer in order to reduce the number of answer candidates. As there is no 413 2010 IEEE 978-1-4244-6527-9/10/$26.00 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  standard Chinese question taxo nomy, this paper builds Chinese question taxonomy by combining Chinese question features and some other question taxonomy   13 from previous researchers. Table 1 shows all question types T ABLE 1    C HINESE QUESTION TAXONOMY  Coarse Fine abbreviation abbreviation, explanation human Discoverer, person name, position, inventor, first person, human description human others location city, continent, country, ocean, mountain, state, province, island, river address, lake, sea numeric code, total, area, money, distance, length, order, percent, spend temperature, size, weight, age, period, frequency, phone number, numeric other time date, time, day, month, season, year, time range, time list, time other entity animal, body, color, plant, creative, disease, substance, religion, press, event food, instrument, language, product, Sport, vehicle, symbol, technique  description definition, description, manner, reason, other description organization Party, sports-team, university,  bank, company, institute, union, other organization 3  Question classification based on association rules 3.1  Specification of the association rules To mine the association rules is to discover the important relevance between the items in a transaction database. In the association ru les, the item sets I={i1,i2,É,in includes n different items. Given a transaction database D each transaction record is a subset of the sets I. The association rule is described as Y X  here I X   I Y  and   Y X  Its support degree and confidence degree are separately defined as follow formulas   D T Y T X D T  Y X  support      1  X  support  Y X  support  Y X  confidence    2 The task to mine association ru les is to discover all of the strong association rules. The support degree of the rules is no less than the minimize support degree determined by the users and the confidence degree is no less than the minimize confidence degree determined by the users   From formula \(1\e support degree reflects the frequency of the item set occurring in the transaction database D. The item set, which frequency is more than the threshold, is a frequent item sets. So we think the frequent item sets means that there is some correlation between the corresponding items 3.2  Features extraction  Given a Chinese question, ou r system first segments it and tags its words POS. After that the system then extracts   pertinent features from th e question. This step is very important part to any question classification system. Better feature sets can provide more accurate question representations and finally can be used to get better classification performance. After features extraction a feature vector is created, which is the basis for mining association rules. There are usually two kinds of features can be extracted from the question sets to con struct the vector: lexical semantic features \(word POS and named entity types and so on\\(Bi-gr am and dependency relation and so on  To select the words and POS features, the research [8 introduces that POS is little effective of question classification, and Chinese POS tags is more difficult than English. So POS isnêt ex tracted as classific feature in this paper To extract N-gram and depe ndency syntactic features the research ribution of de pende ncy relation is no better than that of Bi-gram because of the precision of the dependency parser. So Bi-gram is selected as classific feature in this paper 3.3  Basic idea of question classification based on mining association rules In the paper, questions set is regarded as a transaction database, and a question in it is regarded as a transaction record, the words and other features extracted from the questions are regarded as item s. If some items frequently occur together in some transactions, then there must be some correlation between them. The paper redefines the meanings of the formula 1 and formula 2 Given a question, Y presents 414 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  the set of the types of the qu estion, X means the set of its classific features. The item sets I includes all question types and all question classific features. The database D is the question sets, each record T is a question. The association rule Y X  means that the type Y of the question can be determined by its classific features set X The basic idea of the question classification based on mining association rules is: to di scover the frequent item sets composed of the question types and question classific features by scanning question database, which support degree is no less than the threshold of support degree; to produce the association rules Y X   which confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the confidence degree based on maximum frequent item sets; at last to determine the type of the question by choo sing the type wh ich the most association rules deduced In the research, there are more items in the frequent item sets, theirs frequency occurring in the question database is less, theirs support degree is less But these frequent item sets are helpful to the classification. In order to avoid to loss these frequent item sets, the paper gives different min-support degree according to different N-frequent item sets. N is larger the min-support degree is smaller. N is smaller, the degree is larger. The association rules Y X  which confidence degree is no less than the threshold of the confidence degree is produced 3.4  Question classification based on mining association rules Given a question, firstly ch oose the association rules from the association rules database according to its classific features, the selected rules may be more than one, they are all used in question classification. At last the type of the question is determined by the rules committee voting, the type which is determined by the most rules is selected as the type of the question. The algorithm is as follows Step1 Generate the frequent item sets Step1.1 Generate the 1-candidate sets according to the question database, scan the database to obtain their support degree, select the candi date sets which support degree is no less than the threshold of support degree to formulate the 1-frenquent item sets  Step1.2 Use N-frequent item sets to generate N+1-candidate sets, set a smaller threshold of support degree rescan the database to obtain their support deg ree, select the candidate sets which degree is no less than the threshold to formulate the N+1-frenquent item sets  Step1.3 Try the step1.2 again and again, until no N+1 candidate sets generates or N is more than 5. Get all frequent item sets which satisfy the condition  Step2 Produce the association rules Y X  from maximum frequent item sets according to the threshold of the confidence degree  Step3 Given a question, choose the association rules according to its classific features. At last the type of the question is determined by the rules committee voting. The type, which is decided by the most rules, is selected as the type of the question  Step4 Output the type End the program 4  Experiments and result analysis 4.1  Data set  There arenêt standard data sources for Chinese question classification. Here a data set is defined as a set of Chinese questions labeled with expected answer types according to some question taxonomy. So we collect our question set from the TREC QA track which was first introduced at TREC-8 We download the free test question set from TREC, translate them and modify them as our test question set. There are 5500 questions  4.2  Experiments and results  In order to test the classifier in this paper, we conduct the experiments under the fine grained category definition  We conduct evaluation in terms of precision shown as formula \(3  all corr num num precision  3 Here, numcorr is the number of the correct classified questions, while numall is the total of the testing questions  Experiment 1: comparison st udy of different scale of training set. The test set is 500 questions. The experimental results are shown in table 2 T ABLE 2    C OMPARISON STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT SCALE QUESTION TRAINING SET  feature 2000 3500 5000 word 62.8% 68.8 71.8 Word+Bi-gram 69.2% 78.0 83.8  From table 2, we can find that the precision is better and better with the enlargement of the questions set It is because that the association rules are based on the statistic of the feature frequency, and larger training set is more advantageous to compute the feature frequency and more coincident with the fact. So the classification result is more effective. The precision based on words and Bi-gram is improved by about 10% compared to classifier based on 415 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  words only because Bi-gram is a kind of structural information and is more informative than words  Experiment 2: we design open test and close test based on KNN and AR\(association ru les\Open test: the test set is 500 questions extracted random ly from 5500 question set and the rest 5000 question is as th e training set. Close test: the training set is 5000 questions and the test set is 500 questions extracted randomly from the training set. The experimental results are shown in table 3 T ABLE 3    C OMPARISON STUDY OF THE KNN AND THE AR Test manner KNN AR Close test 68.4 86.4 Open test 65.8 83.8  Table 3 shows that the AR me thod in this paper achieves better performance than the KNN method. As the table shows the precisions of open test are close to the precisions of close test. It proves that the proposed method can achieve good performance in question classifi cation for new question set  5  Conclusion This paper puts forward a new method for Chinese question classification based on the mining association rules Words and Bi-gram are extracted from question as classific features. The method can mine the association rules between the question type and its features, and the type of the question is determined by choosing the type which the most association rules deduced. The experimental results show that the precision obtained by our algo rithm is higher than other algorithms. In future, we will ex tract more features \(including named entity, chunk, question focu s, Bi-gram and so on order to be favorable to question classification and expect to improve the method of mining association rules References 1  Hull, D.: 1999, Xerox TREC-8 question answering track report.

This model identifies statistically significant event associations inherent in a given data set, using residual analysis to test whether or not a pattern candidate is significantly deviated from a default loglinear model. The generated rules annotated with weight of evidence are fired independently to classify the input feature vector In scenarios where labeling requires further statistical augmentation, a deterministic means of confidence could be derived. The confidence measure can be further combined with the label to supplement the decision analogous to multiple votes. The proposed non-fuzzy model leveraging such weighted classifiers increases the accuracy of decisionmaking R EFERENCES  M Hol s heimer and A.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The ìGenerateî button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of userís choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Intíl Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,îin Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,î in Proc. of the 7th ACM Intíl Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Intíl Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Intíl.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
