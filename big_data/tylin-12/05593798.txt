Example 1 In a large database of supermarket transactions an association rule is milk  bread  supp  30  conf   The support of 30 means that only 30 of the customers have purchased both milk and bread The conìdence of 85 means that 85 of the customers who have purchased milk also have purchased bread In general association rules mining can be viewed as a two-step process 1 Find all frequent itemsets By deìnition each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predetermined minimum support 2 Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets By deìnition these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum conìdence In this paper we mainly focus on the second step The frequent itemsets of the rst step can be found by several algorithms such as basic Apriori B Template-based Association Rules Mining Template-based mining means user speciìes the form of rules to be mined\(called rule template Rule templates may include the maximum or minimum number of predicates that can occur in the rule antecedent or consequent or as relationships among attributes attribute values and/or aggregates Rule templates are expressions like A 1   A k  A k 1 where each A i is either an attribute name a class name or an expression C  or C   where C is a class name Here C and C correspond to one or more and zero or more instances of the class C respectively If the rule B 1   B h  B h 1 can be considered to be an instance of the template A 1   A k  A k 1  we call rule B 1   B h  B h 1 matches rule template A 1   A k  A k 1  Example 2 In a database of software defect a defect may be associated with one or more function modules If tester is interested in function Statistics In particular it would be interesting to know the associations where Statistics is one the right hand side and there is another function on the left hand side such as M onthly Data  Statistics Such rules match the pattern Any F unction   Statistics C Rule Templates in Software Defect Repositories Software defect reports are usually described in natural language which include tester test date priority summary detail description steps to reproduce and some other related attach les It can pro vide manager decision information to improve the process of software development by mining association rules from defect repositories We only focus on the black-box defect in this paper We classify the original defects according to ODC-BD\(Orthogonal Defect Classiìcation for Black-box Defect and then retain tester and test date of the original defect reports In this paper we take the following typical rule templates as examples to show our improved template-based method Template 1 Each T ester  Any Def ectT ype  The template aims to know which kinds of defects are often found by each tester From the matched rules managers can see everyoneês testing ability and it is helpful to assign test resources Furthermore if adding time constraint managers can evaluate testerês work according to different period For example an instance is T esterA  212  supp  20  conf   Here 212 is the line number of ODC-BDês defect and it refers to Message format and content error The above rule can show 90 of defects which detected by TesterA are simple error as Message format and content error Template 2 AnyDef ectT ype   Condition   AnyDef ectT ype  Result  The description of one defect usually includes occurred condition data or operation and result\(phenomenon Therefore we distinguish whether a defect type is a condition or a result for a certain defect Template 2 can show which kinds of data or operations easily lead to which kinds of defect phenomenon In the instance of Template 2 C means a defect type is a condition and R means a defect type is a result For example an instance is C 68 C 106  R 209 R 221  supp 2  conf   Here 68 means Boundary value 106 means Name of path/folder/ìle 209 means Prompt/Error message is wrong and 221 means GUI display error The rule indicates when testing the name of path/folder/ìle with boundary value prompt/error message and GUI display are often incorrect It reminds tester to use boundary value when testing the name of path/folder/ìle III I MPROVED M ETHOD B ASED ON R ULE T EMPLATES A Optimization by Reducing Unnecessary Rule Generation To optimize the rule generation we propose the following theorems The theorems indicate that in what conditions we can reduce unnecessary rule generation and in what conditions we can not Theorem 1 Let X  Y be itemset and Y 1 be a subset of Y  If rule X  Y 1 is not strong then X  Y is certainly not strong 1797 ThP14.1 


Proof By the deìnition of support the support of a subset is certainly greater than or equals the support of itês superset we have supp  X  Y 1  supp  X  Y  So that conf  X  Y 1  supp  X  Y 1  supp  X   supp  X  Y   supp  X   conf  X  Y  Since rule X  Y 1 is not strong we have conf  X  Y 1 012 minconf and conf  X  Y  012 conf  X  Y 1 012 minconf Thus rule X  Y is certainly not strong Theorem 2 Let X  Y be itemset and X 1 be a subset of X  Regardless of whether rule X 1  Y is strong the generation of rule X  Y can not be optimized Proof By the deìnition of support the support of a subset is certainly greater than or equals the support of itês superset so we have supp  X 1  supp  X  and supp  X 1  Y   supp  X  Y  The conìdence of rule  X 1  Y  and  X  Y  is deìned as follows conf  X 1  Y  supp  X 1  Y   supp  X 1 conf  X  Y  supp  X  Y   supp  X  Therefore the size of conf  X 1  Y   conf  X  Y  is uncertain Thus the generation of rule X  Y can not be optimized and it is uncertain whether rule X  Y is strong until the conf  X  Y  is calculated B Method and Algorithm Description In this section we present the improved method based on rule templates The method is divided into three steps  Step1  Find all frequent itemsets by any algorithm Here we use the classical Apriori algorithm to nd them  Step2  Put proper items into two different sets\(e.g antecedentSet and consequentSet  according to the left and right hand side of the speciìed template Thus this step optimizes the rule generation with rule templates  Step3  Combine every nonempty subset of the antecedentSet and the consequentSet to generate rules During combination apply the theorems presented in Section III-A to reduce the unnecessary rule generation The Apriori algorithm in step1 which generates all frequent itemsets can be found so Algorithm 1 only contains the step2 and step3 in detail  Input  all frequent itemsets f reqItemSet  minimum conìdence minconf Output  strong association rules set ruleSet 1 delete frequent 1-itemset 2 for each frequent itemset l in f reqItemSet do   Optimize by rule templates 3 antecedentSet    4 consequentSet    5 for each item i in l do  6 if i matches the left of rule template then  7 add i into antecedentSet  8 else if i matches the right of rule template then  9 add i into consequentSet  10 else  11 continue 12 end 13 end 14 generate all nonempty subsets of antecedentSet  15 generate all nonempty subsets of consequentSet   Optimize by theorems 16 for each subset setA in antecedentSet do  17 weakItemSet    18 for each subset setB in consequentSet do  19 for each weakItem  weakItemSet  20 if setB is not superset of weakItem then  21 generate rule setA  setB  22 calculate the conf conf f setA  setB  23 if conf  minconf then  24 add setA  setB into ruleSet  25 else  26 add setB into weakItemSet  27 end 28 end 29 end 30 end 31 end 32 return ruleSet   Algorithm 1 Improved Algorithm In addition to compare with our improved algorithm we also implement the Apriori rule generation algorithm described in C Example Letês try an example based on Template 2 described in Section II-C Suppose l   C 68 C 107 R 209 R 221  is a frequent 4-itemset What are the association rules that can be generated from l  1798 ThP14.1 


According to the Template 2 the left of the rule should contain C and the right of it should contain R thus antecedentSet is  C68 C106  and consequentSet is  R209 R221   The nonempty of antecedentSet are  C68    C106  and  C68 C106   The nonempty of consequentSet are  R209    R221  and  R209 R221   The steps of generating rules are listed in Table I and let minconf be 60 TABLE I E XAMPLE OF RULE GENERATION BY A LGORITHM 1  Rule  Conf  weakItemSet  ruleSet   C 68  R 209   50   R 209      C 68  R 221   60   R 209      C 68  R 209 R 221          C 106  R 209   72       C 106  R 221   23   R 221      C 106  R 209 R 221          C 68 C 106  R 209   90       C 68 C 106  R 221   75       C 68 C 106  R 209 R 221   75      For example due to the conìdence of   C 68  R 209   is smaller than minconf\(60 the rst rule should not be included in  ruleSet  thus the value of column  ruleSet is    and  R209  is added into weakItemSet  The conìdence of the second rule is larger than minconf so  C 68  R 221  should be add into  ruleSet  with    Then the right hand side of third rule is a superset of  R209  in weakItemSet  so the rule is reduced according to Algorithm 1 with    For this example the nal output  ruleSet is  C 68  R 221    C 106  R 209    C 68 C 106  R 209    C 68 C 106  R 221  and  C 68 C 106  R 209 R 221   IV E XPERIMENT To show Algorithm 1 can improve the generation of association rule  we set up the following experiment We take Template 2 described in Section II-C as our target rule template and use the classiìcation result data in as our experimental data The original defect data include 1660 blackbox defect reports distributed in 39 industrial projects and 200 black-box defect reports of open source projects\(Eclipse and Firefox All the experiments are performed on a 2.40GHz Intel core2 duo PC machine with 2GB memory running on Microsoft Windows 7 All the programs are written in Java Fig 1 compares the total number of association rules generated by Algorithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm Fig 1 shows that the improved template-based algorithm can signiìcantly reduce the total number of association rules Therefore user can nd the interesting rules more easily by this method Another comparison is run time comparison between Algorithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm Fig 2 shows that the improved template-based algorithm has a better performance than basic Apriori Algorithm in generating interesting rules V C ONCLUSION In this paper we present a new improved template-based method to generate the association rules This method is a  Fig 1 Number of Rules Comparison of Algorithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm Fig 2 Run Time Comparison of Algorithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm two step optimization Firstly optimize the generation using rule templates which are speciìed according to userês special constraints Then reduce unnecessary rule generation by the theorems presented in Section III-A To validate the improved method we apply it in mining rules from software black-box defect repositories The empirical study shows the improved template-based method can reduce the total number of the rules and the run time comparing with Apriori algorithm The mined interesting rules is very helpful for software manager and tester R EFERENCES  J Han H Cheng D Xin and X Y an Frequent pattern mining current status and future directions Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol 15 no 1 pp 55-86 2007  R Agra w al T  Imieliski and A Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data Washington D.C United States 1993 pp 207-216  J Han and M Kamber  Data Mining Concepts and T echniques 2nd edition Morgan 2006  M Klemettinen H Mannila P  Ronkainen H T o i v onen and A I Verkamo Finding interesting rules from large sets of discovered association rules Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management Gaithersburg Maryland United States 1994 pp 401-407  N Li Z Li and L Zhang Mining Frequent P atterns from Softw are Defect Repositories for Black-box Testing Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop Intelligent System and Applications\(ISA2010 Wuhan China 2010 pp 522-525  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,éProceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases 1994 pp 487-499  N Li and Z Li Ov ervie w o f Softw are Defect Data Processing Research Computer Science 2009,36\(8 pp 21-25,78 in Chinese with English abstract  N Li Z Li and X Sun Classiìcation of Softw are Defect Detected by Black-box Testing An Empirical Study unpublished 1799 ThP14.1

For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
