Apriori algorithm is a mostly learned and implemented algorithm that mines the data warehouses to find the associations. Frequent item set mining with vertical data format has been proposed as an improvement over the basic Apriori algorithm In this paper we are proposing an algorithm as an alternative to Apriori algorithm, which will use bitmap indices in conjunction with a horizontal format data set converted to a vertical format data structure to mine frequent itemsets leveraging efficiencies of bitmap based operations and vertical format data orientation Categories and Subject Descriptors Data Mining  As s o ciation  R u le, A p riori, B i t m ap In dices   Data Analysis w a reh ousing  Data An al y s is  General Terms Data Analysis and Mining Keywords Data mining, Association Rule, Apriori, Vertical format mining, Bitmap Indices I I NTRODUCTION Data Mining is an emerging concept or a tool in database concepts, which is young, yet powerful and promising [1 Knowledge discovery, prediction, clustering, and classifications through pattern recognition are some of the key design aspects of data mining. Most of the existing techniques on the associations are based on analysing the data warehouses - the existing bulk data of transaction history Given the existence of a set of items, association rules enable the prediction of the existence of one or more other items based on the knowledge gathered by classifying the data warehouses. Association rules are commonly used in mining web usag n t r u s i o n det ec t i o n 4], an d bi oi n f or m a t i c s 5 Statistical bias caused by suggesting a hypothesis by nonrepresentative data or a narrow sample to match the hypothesis is defined as data-snooping bias, which leads to a wrong decision in calculations, so these factors also should be taken in to consideration [6  p riori alg orithm 1] is considered the fundamental algorithm for mining for associations. Hybrid algorithms converging the classification and association rule mining have also been sugges With the explosive growth of the data base size, scalability for the data mining algorithms becomes crucial to be able to work with very large data sets effectively. In this paper, a hybrid frequent item-set mining method extending Apriori algorithm is proposed II P RELIMINARIES Finding frequent item sets plays an important role in data mining as the first step in determining association rules A M ARKET B ASKET A NALYSIS Association rule learning is mostly explained by market basket analysis in g  th e a s s o ciatio n bet w een t h e  items that customers purchase.

It is believed that in order for a set of interest, its support must be above a user-defined minimum such sets are called 'frequent'.

Corresponding column mentions the relevant list of item ids for the particular transaction. As an example çT200 transaction contains çI2é and çI4é item ids In frequent item-set mining, we derive rules based on two measurements called minimum support and the minimum confidence that reflect the usefulness and certainty of the discovered rules. Typically, association rules are considered interesting if they satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence thresh  B A LGORITHM A PRIORI This algorithm defines several stages. At the i-th stage identifies all frequent i-element sets. Each stage consists of two steps: the formation of candidates \(candidate generation and the counting of candidates \(candidate counting\.  At the step of forming the candidates, algorithm creates a lot of candidates from the i-element sets.  At the step of counting candidates algorithm scans the database of transactions computing support sets of candidates.  After scanning, the algorithm discards the candidates, ensuring that less than a user-defined minimum and saves only the common i-element sets During the 1 st phase of the selected set of candidates contains all 1-element sets.  Algorithm calculates their support during the step counting candidates. Thus, after the first phase all frequent 1-element sets are known. Reasoning in a straight line, a candidate can "burn" all pairs of goods. However Apriori reduces the number of sets of candidate sifting - a priori - those candidates who may not be frequent, based on information received at previous stages of the information on which of the sets are the most abundant.  Screenings are based on the simple assumption that if the set is frequent, all its subsets must also be frequent. Thus, before the counting of candidates step algorithm can reject any candidate set, a subset of which is not frequent. This process is continued until the number of frequent n-item-sets becomes zero, where n determines the no. of children in the item-set C A LGORITHM O PTIMIZATION 1\  P RUNING Mannila et al. proposed pruning techniques to reduce the size of candidate se a n opti m izatio n  Pru n i ng s t rate g y  for the algorithm is based on a characteristic: a frequent itemset is a set where all its subsets are frequent 2\  D YNAMIC HASHING AND PRUNING Park et al. suggested a hash based algorithm \(DHP\which generates candidate large itemsets efficiently, while reducing the size of the transaction data base [1 m b er of can didate  itemsets generated by DHP is smaller than that generated using existing algorithms, making it efficient for large itemsets, specifically for the large 2-itemsets 3\  P ARALLEL D ATA MINING Park et al., extended DHP into a parallel data mining algorithm, facilitating parallel generation of the candidate itemsets and parallel determination of large itemsets [11  4\  T RANSACTION R EDUCTION Agrawal et al. proposed this algorithm to reduce the number of transactions scanned in the future iterations [12  tran s action t h at does n o t con tai n any  f r equ e n t k itemsets can not contain any frequent \(K +1\msets, hence can be removed 5\  P ARTITION Savasere et al. designed a Partition-based highly parallel algorithm [14  w h ic h  lo g i c a ll y d i v i d e s th e d a ta b a se i n to  several disjoint blocks.

ECLAT \(Equivalence CLASS Transformation algorithm developed by Zaki u s ed to m i n e e f f i cie n t l y  using vertical data formats 8\  V ERTICAL FORMAT DATA MINING Apriori algorithm mines frequent patterns from a horizontal data format which represents the items categorized into particular transactions, where vertical data format represents data as transactions categorized into particular items. So for a particular item, there is a set of corresponding transaction ids Instead of horizontal data format, Apriori can be extended to use vertical data format for efficient mining Vertical format data mining only has to parse the dataset once to get the itemsets. For the itemset generation from the 2 nd itemset it only needs to refer the previous itemset. So this eliminates the need to parse through the dataset each time to count the frequency of itemsets, for each round. Hence vertical format mining is more efficient than its horizontal from, which has motivated general purpose algorithms such as VIPER [18 ed on th e v e rt ical f o r m at repres entation   III H ORIZONTAL F ORMAT D ATA M INING WITH E XTENDED B ITMAPS We propose the algorithm 'Horizo ntal Format Data Mining with Extended Bitmaps', for mining a data set in a horizontal format, by converting it to a data structure of vertical format along with bitmaps indices to store the itemset data  P ARSING THE DATASET TO CREATE 1 ST ITEMSET AND BITMAPS Here, the first and only parsing of the dataset is done 1 Creating the master array 2 Creating bitmaps relevant to each item in master array 2010 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition 221 


a Ö masterArray; i n Item n; b Ö associatedItemArray; c Ö BitSet Fig. 1: Main data storage structure of the extended vertical data mining As in Fig. 1, masterArray is an array of Item objects of all items in the dataset. Under each item, there is an array of other items occurring together with it in transactions which we call from, which we refer from now on as AssociatedItems. Under each AssociatedItem, we store a bit vector indicating the presence of the AssociatedItem for every transaction where the Item is found. Basically length of bit vectors give the number of transactions that its root Item in masterArray is found. If the AssociatedItem is in the transaction, bit vector value for that transaction will be 1 \(true\otherwise 0 \(false B R EMOVE REDUNDANT ASSOCIATED ITEMS  Here for better memory utilisation, the redundant duplicate mappings \(AssociatedItems\are pruned from the main data structure such as, Item i 1 mapped to AssociatedItem i 2 and Item i 2 mapped to AssociatedItem i 1 in the masterArray C P RUNING ITEMSETS ACCORDING TO APRIORI PROPERTY  Association mining is carried out solely in this step, in three major phases. The core logic of Apriori property is used, but implementation is done using the manipulation of bit vectors 1 st frequency itemset extraction The items not satisfying the minimum support are removed from the masterArray 2 nd frequency itemset extraction Here we iterate through the associatedItemArrays for each Item in masterArray. For each AssociatedItem, the cardinality of its bit vector is compared with the minimum support value. AssociatedItems having less than the minimum support are removed Extracting frequency itemsets above two For mining frequency item sets of three or above, we start intersecting bit vectors of AssociatedItems, compare result bit vectors cardinality with minimum support value, and remove the AssociatedItems as Apriori property suggests. This will take place for increasing frequency itemset values and stop when no more frequent item sets are present. In this recurring step two main data structures [Fig. 2, Fig s ed Fig. 2: Pattern Structure Pattern structure Fig. 2, is used to store each resultant bit vector from intersection of bit vectors and the itemset ids for those intersected bit vectors' belonging items. As Pattern is also a representation of item sets, we can use it as a frequent itemset itself  Fig. 3: Candidates Structure Candidates structure Fig. 3, is used to store the frequent item sets of each level of itemset size. Here each candidate level is an array of patterns. Each level indicates the frequency itemset level, hence frequent itemsets of length one will be under level one, frequent itemsets of length two will be under level two and so on. Once the above steps are completed, the frequent item sets are retrieved by iterating through the candidate structure IV E XPERIMENTAL S TUDY The algorithm was implemented and benchmarked in a system with 2 GB memory and 2.5 Ghz core 2 Duo Processor against an implementation of Apriori algorithm for chosen datasets ong  w i t h di ff e r en t  v a l u es o f  m i n i m u m  su pport  as both the algorithms mine the datasets in horizontal form TABLE II T 10 I  4 D  10K Minimum Support T10I4D10K Apriori \(sec HFDM-EB \(sec 0.75 1934.4 10.6 1 1365.4 10.5 2 238.4 10.4 5 1.6 9.6 F IG  4 T 10 I  4 D  10K TABLE III T  10 I  4 D  100K Minimum Support T10I4D100K Apriori \(sec HFDM-EB \(sec 0.75 21039.1 134.2 1 12600.5 132.1 2 2365.1 131.7 5 1.3 132.1 222 2010 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition

In most of the cases the proposed algorithm showed a significant improvement over the Apriori while the Apriori implementation was more efficient at high support levels. Here the results of our algorithm are dominated by the time to build the bitmap and not time taken to mine it The time taken to build the bitmap is independent of the number of frequent item sets. But Apriori's time drops drastically when the number of frequent items is low. Thus Apriori was seen having a higher performance at high support levels where number of frequent item sets found is low V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK In this paper we have proposed an efficient algorithm for Association Rule Mining, which recovers the associations as the Apriori and the other existing algorithms do. We implemented it in Java, which may be more efficient, if implemented in C or a lower level language For each data item, a bitmap is created for each associated item. If there are n associated items for a data item, then the number of candidate sets generated is n\(n-1\o there can be redundant bitmaps created for the same data item pairs Currently redundant pairs are pruned after creating the vertical format. But, if there is a dynamic pruning mechanism to prune redundant data item pairs while creating the vertical format memory can be well optimized The algorithm lends well to Map Reduce like distributed data mining since mining of each data item is independent of others. So this algorithm can be enhanced to work in a distributed environment with or without a shared memory For some larger data sets that are having many items per transaction, the algorithm fails to withstand due to utilizing prohibitive amount of memory. It can be mitigated by using compressed bitm ple m e n t a tion i n s t ead of plain bitmaps, so the memory is utilized better R EFERENCES 1 J i a w e i Ha n an d  M i c h eli n e K a m b er  Da t a Min in g C o n c ept s an d Techniques,é 2nd Edition, 2006 2 A br aham S i l b e r s c hatz H e nr y  F  K o rth an d S  S u d a r s h a n   D ata bas e  System Concepts,é 5th Edition.

This  rule has 100% confidence    In other words, it means if site  S 4   and  S 7  are selected to  work together to transfer the requested files, t h en this  implies site\(s  S 3  can also be selected to share the work at  the same time. This rule has confidence  100  This  particular rule has  confidence  of  100  meaning that  S 4  S 7   and  S 3  can be selected as a best set of replicas by  Replica  Manage r  to ge t  requested files. To compute the correlation  of this rule and see how far it is better than choosing the site  randomly, we use an Improvement equation     indicates that it has support of  26  transactions, meaning that in transaction  Single Trip  Time  Table  there are  2 6  concurrent uncongested trips of  S 4  S 7   i.e. these sites have similar network conditions in particular  time      indicates the total number of transactions  involving uncongested trips of  S 3   in  Rule 1  is equal to  174    This is a piece of a side information; it is not involved  in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself       is the number of transactions where   S 4   S 7 as well as   S 3 has uncongested trips. In  Rule 1  it is equal  to  2 6       or   indicates how much  more likely we are to encounter  S 4  and  S 6  transaction if we  consider just those transactions where  S 3  S 5 and  S 8  have  uncongested trips. As compared to the entire population of  the transactions, it's t h e  confidenc e  divided by  support \(c   where the latter is expressed as a percentage   For  Rule 1 the  confidenc e is  100   support \(c  in  percentage   174/194\*100 = 89.6 9 So, th e    Lift ratio = 100/89.69.1 = 1.1   As it is clearly shown in  Figure 7  some r u les with  an improvement value less than one means this is an  unreliable rule. Whereas the rule with a value more than one  means this rule is better than random replica selection with  number of time equal to improvement value as it is shown in  Figure 8                   When improvement value is more than 1 it is better to use  EST to select replica sites, because it selects the sites able to  work simultaneously    I n  Figure  9  we sho w  the  comparison between EST and  traditional model using highest bandwidth a s  a criterion to  select the best replica. As we can observe our technique has  a better performance most of the times because it selects the  sites which have the stable links. In traditional method the  site which has the highest bandwidth does not always me a n  to be the best because sometimes this highest bandwidth  link can be congeste d   Let us declare more by the following  scenario  o f  Figure 1 0 suppose   S 0   be the computing site  and let   S 1  S 3   S 1 4   be replica sites  Red stars referring to  congested router s   Using traditional selection method the  file will be got from S14 since it has less number of Hops  routers\ and highest and also has highest bandwidth link         Figure 8.

The adapta b ility feature  addressed by our replica selection strategy is inferred from  the observation that the basic metrics, which influence the  QoS that the user perceives when accessing a replica  depend directly on the application being replicated and on  the cli e nts\222 preferences. To reach this objective that, we  used   the concept of association rules of data mining  approach to the most stable links sites in order to reduce the  searching space the response time and network resources  consumed    A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S  Au t hors wish to express their sincere thanks to  Prof. Arun Agarwal, from GridLabs Department of  Computer and Information Sciences, University of  Hyderabad, India for providing all the infrastructural and  computational support required to carry out this work  His  academic suggestions to improve the quality of the work are  also highly appreciated and acknowledged   R EFERENCE S     M  Rashedur Rahma n   Ken Barke r   Reda Alhaj j    Replica  selection in grid environment:a dat a mining approac h    Distributed systems and grid computing \(DSGC\,pp: 695  226  700  2005    J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
