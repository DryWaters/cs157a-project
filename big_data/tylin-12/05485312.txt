Once the End User confirms the Mode of Travel, a list of schedules of Preferred Mode of Travel from Source to Destination with all the details is retrieved and shown on the Mobile Screen of the End User \(figure 2f\d User can then book for the Travel   Fig. 2f.  List of Flights from source to destination with details of Discounts   One of the main objectives of context aware applications is to discover service accordi ng to the user’s preference Web has transformed so much that many enterprises provide certain services like Map, RSS, product search etc as API \(Application Programming Interface\which can be invoked by general users. These API’s could be very useful for a traveler. For example a Map service can help to locate a place or provide driving directions from a place to another. In Musafir we had used the Map Service AP  to help the end user by  providing the Driving Direction from source to destination\ if they opt for driving their own Transport / Car \(figure 2g\usafir provides a separate servlet to address this. This servlet has two functions viz. \(a\ap service API \(b\PI function provided by a 3 rd party bulk Short Message Service \(SMS  service  provider  Once the end user indicates to the servlet that they prefer driving their own transport, Map Service API is invoked to get the driving directions for the travel and the link to page is sent as an SMS using the SMS API function to the users mobile phone    Fig. 2g. Map showing the Driving Direction between the Source and Destination  The two Servlets mentioned above are actually connected to a MySQL database table called ‘journeydet’ present in the Cloud. Once the user confirms the bookings travel details of the users along with their mobile number, IMEI number, date of journey, source and destination of journey mode of journey etc are stored in a table ‘journeydet’. This will help in eliminating static rules and the dataset for Apriori algorithm will have an improved support such that it can provide more accurate results based on the Dynamic Database details   A small automated program \(procedure\ould run at the start of everyday.  It has three main functions \(a\earch function, which is basically a SQL query to select details Mobile number, source and destination of travel\f those who are travelling on that particular day from journeydet table \(b\voke weather service AP d f i n d o u t t h e  respective weather conditions for each of the identified

destination \(c\API which would then send the respective weather information to the corresponding mobile numbers. This information would help to facilitate the travel arrangements of the end user  B  Healthcare, Education and Shopping Modules  End User forms \(figure 3a\were developed based on Flex Technology which would facilitate Rich User Experience. User can fill in the Health Complaints and submit the details to the Cloud. A third party API which facilitates SMS to a Mobile device was integrated with the Servlet program.  Once the Database \(on the Cloud\ is updated with the Health complaints, the API can trigger an alert to a registered expert Physician    Fig. 3a. End User entering the health complaints  Physicians were provided with a mobile application which would help them to assess the Patient’s Health Complaints from the Cloud database [2 P h y s ician  u p  o n  analyzing the case,  can submit their Diagnosis and Prescription details to the Cloud Database seamlessly which would send an SMS alert to the patient who filled in the Complaint. This application also empowers the End User to transfer ECG and images to the Cloud which could also be viewed by the Physician \(figure 3b    Fig. 3b. Physician’s view of the ECG signal of a Patient retrieved from the Cloud Education Module of Musafir empowers an End User to select and watch Videos relating subjects of their interest The typical End User could be any consumer and specifically academic community around the world.  The videos will be streamed from the Cloud \(figure 4 Performance of such an application depends on bandwidth of the network and type of communication technology used. In our lab environment we were able to upload a  5MB file to the Cloud in roughly around 2minute 30 seconds to 3 minutes and the time taken to download the file / stream the file from the same is around 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes considering the connection speed to be a maximum of 512KBPS DSL Connection     Fig. 4. Educational Videos that could be accessed by a Touch Screen interface  Shopping module of Musafir enables an End User Consumer, to watch Demos related to various Retail Products, to understand the Location of their availability their Price and to store their personalized shopping choices in a ‘Shopping Cart’, which could connect to a Billing/Credit Card System \(figure 5    Fig. 5. Demos of Retail products available at a particular location Security is a major concern for web based applications where there is a possibility of a large number of users Having realized the sensitivity of datasets we are trying to address security issue by using 128 byte Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\gorithm on the datasets

For each application there would a set of administrators and end users. Hence a role based access to the database is also being studied and implemented. We are currently working towards making Healthcare, Education and Shopping modules more ‘intelligent’ by making them ContextAware  III  CONCLUSION  Musafir was targeted towards Healthcare, Retail, Travel Education /Content Management Business Groups and its Users.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
