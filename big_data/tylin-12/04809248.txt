is a computerized representation of a picture or from an image is an excellent difficult high-level graphic An Image Map is therefore defined to be an computer vision problem whose time has come image of a geographic space taken from a satellite 2 The emergence of vast amounts of geographically So there is a need to develop a system for capturing calibrated image data is a great reason for storing checking integrating manipulating analysing computer vision to start looking globally 
on the and displaying data which are spatially referenced to scale of the entire planet In this paper we propose the Earth a correlated association rule based framework for querying an image database The analysis is based 12 Aerial Image Map on geographic locations from a single image using a An aerial image is a projected image which is purely data driven feature extraction approach floating in air and cannot be viewed normally It We 
apply a specific set of traditional data mining can only be seen from one position in space often techniques such as association to the non focused by another lens 4 Aerial image technology traditional domain of image datasets Image was used in optical printers and computer graphics Features are selected based on the position of the Aerial photography is a hybrid of two separate image objects using color histograms approach and 
technologies aviation and photography 1 A variety Line features Correlation analysis is applied on of combinations have been used which have proved image datasets using association rule A query useful to a wide range of fields scientific military model based on Query by Example QBE is and artistic Aerial views generally adhere to one of proposed And we improve the technique further two types the direct vertical producing a rational by 
using association rule based query mining linear representation useful in cartography and the oblique horizontal resulting in a more descriptive I INTRODUCTION pictorial image 2 Although aerial photography usually implies air-to-ground views it can also include 1.1 Image Map air-to-air images of aircraft cloud formations and 1.1 Image Map other meteorological phenomena 1 An image is defined to be a two-dimensional function f\(x y z where x and y 
are spatial plane 1.3 Image Mining Techniques coordinates and z is the intensity or gray level of the Simply stated image mining refers to extracting image at that point When x y  the amplitude values   
m f or mining knowledge from large amounts of data of f are all finite and discrete we call the image as sets present in image databases 3 Thus image digital image by means of a 
digital computer mining should have been more appropriately named knowledge mining from image data which is I  unfortunately somewhat long Data mining techniques m 3 have been used for sometime to discover implicit knowledge in transaction databases In particular methods are available for extracting the interestin Figure 1 Some Aerial Images transactions like the products that are most frequently purchased together in market basket analysis 1 978-1-4244-2928 8/09/$25 OO  2009 IEEE 1 543 


Figure 2 18 of our 237 image test set Note how difficult it is to geo locate most of the images Achieving similar success with image datasets remains computing resources 1 It explains propose a novel a challenge however not only due to the size and clustering based dictionary design which adapts the complexity of image data but also the lack of image dictionary to a given data set 5 This method yields equivalents for the association rule components better approximations of the original map data leading namely the items the item sets and even the rules to low error 1 They are probability based  distance The objectives for applying association rule based clustering methods Clustering is a well algorithms to traditional transaction databases are established technique for data interpretation Existing clear A primary objective of market basket analysis is clustering algorithms like k-means PAM Kaufman to determine optimal product placement on store 1990 are designed to find clusters that fit some static shelves 6 However the objectives for mining models Web services are based on XML Extensible association rules in image datasets are less obvious at Markup Language which is a description language this early stage in research when the limit of what is widely used 2 Many XML related technologies are technically feasible is not known 2 Ideally the rules used to describe communicate with  finally use web would provide insight into the prominent trends in the service Finally one of the biggest advantages of web dataset which are interesting but non-obvious spatial services is their ability to be chained 5 By creating a or temporal causalities 5 web services chain one can expand the possibilities of the developed application Vector data sets e.g 1.4 Image Mining Techniques maps are currently major sources of displaying There exist three mining techniques used in some querying and identifying locations of spatial features cases for mining on image datasets They are in a variety of applications 3 It explores the problem Classification Clustering and Association Rule of existing clustering based compression method It Classification approach analyzes the training data and proposes an adaptive approximation method that is construct model for each class based on the features in capable of handling data updates as well as reducing the image data Clustering identifies the collections of error levels 3 The recent availability of GPS tagged image data objects that are similar to each other images of urban environments coupled with advances Association rules corresponds to correlations among in multi-view geometry and efficient feature matching the image data items  they are often expressed in led to a number of groups developing place rule from showing attribute value conditions that recognition algorithms some of which competed in commonly occurs at the same time in some set of the Where am I Contest 7 at ICCV'05 Similar image data feature-based geometric matching approaches have also been success-fully applied to co-registering online 2 RELATED WORKS photographs of famous landmarks for browsing 8 and summarization One of the issues is the effective Existing work done mainly focuses on map image identification of features in the images and the other compression using clustering and classification one is extracting them One of the difficult tasks is to approach Visual localization on a topographical map know the image domain and obtaining a priori has been one of the early problems in computer vision knowledge of what information is required from the which turned out to be extremely challenging for both image This is one of the reasons the Image Mining computers and humans 1 But the situation improves process cannot be completely automated 6 dramatically if more sources of data are available Jacobs et al 6 proposes a very clever and simple method of geo locating a webcam based on correlating 3 PROPOSED DESIGNED MODEL itS video-stream with satellite weather maps over the same time period The problem of dictionary based This section describes the Proposed Designed compression is a good candidate since encoding  Model which will be helpful in building the Map decoding do not need a significantly large amount of 11544 2009 IEEE Internactionalz Advance Computing Conference IACC 2009 


Database We decided to have a four tier model for the analysis of complex data one of the major problems is purpose The various phases of the building process that the number of variables involved Analysis with a have been taken care matching with the proposed large number of variables generally requires a large model The diagram below shows the four tier model amount of memory and computation power or a proposed The first tier focuses on Image collection classification algorithm which over fits the training where we get Feature Extraction Secondary sample and generalizes poorly to new samples information  Tagged information which are stored Feature extraction is a general term for methods of in the Map information Database constructing combinations of the variables to get around these problems while still describing the data with sufficient accuracy A S  Query  3.2 Techniques used for Feature Extraction Imaglletion J C R R  Various techniques for feature extraction were CollectionC u o analyzed To build our image database we pick colour Feature Extraction C Tagged information T E Image E histogram line features secondary information and Secondary Information Io Mining S tagged information 0Database Map Information  N o  Colour histogram In the spirit of most image retrieval DB R literature 1st build joint histogram of a colour Some of the techniques tried were Average color in Gray scale Average color in RGB format and Average color in YCBCR We evaluated the various methods Figure 3 Proposed Designed Model using Precision and Recall and found that RGB performs better than the other two Then we compute The second tier has the layer which uses Association the distance between two objects of an image using chi on Correlation analysis on this Map Information square methodforextracting features Database and then simply builds the Image Mining Line Features After analysis we found that the Database which constitutes the third tier of the model statistics of straight lines in images are useful for The final and fourth tier is used for a query model for distinguishing between natural made and man made processing spatial image queries So finally we have scenes and for finding scenes with similar vanishing the input an Image and by taking object extract scenes For findinge s th h ilar vashin features of image we build the image database Then points For each image build two histogram based on using correlation analysis with the help of Colour Tagged Information Histogram  line features we use Chi square method  Euclidean method to build an image mining database This model is called A Four Tier model for Geographic Information Database Secondary Information 3.1 Building Map Image Database _    r  Feature Extraction Feature extraction is a technique of extracting characteristic information from a given image Transforming the input data into the set of features is called features extraction When the input data is too Standardization large to be processed and it is suspected to be Map Database notoriously redundant much data but not much information then the input data will be transformed Image Collection into a reduced representation set of features also named feature vector Transforming the input data Figure 4 Building Map Image Database into the set of features is calledfeature extraction If the statistics of detected lines one with bins the features extracted are carefully chosen it is corresponding to line to line angles and one with bins expected that the features set will extract the relevant corresponding to line lengths Finding line features of information from the input data in order to perform the a two objects using Euclidian distance between two desired task using this reduced representation instead distinct points in an image of the full size input Feature extraction involves simplifying the amount of resources required to Secondary Information It is the process of using describe a large set of data accurately In performing geo-located information for a map image There is a 2009 IEEE Inxternational Advanxce Computing Conference IACC 2009 1545
