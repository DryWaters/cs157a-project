Keywords- RFID; consumer applications; Internet of Things case-based reasoning; rule-based reasoning I I NTRODUCTION Radio Frequency Identification \(RFID become one of the fastest growing wireless technologies this decade, with estimates of millions of RFID tags and readers  It offers great potential benefits in object identification and tracking in diverse application areas such as access control and security, asset and event management, supply chain and manufacturing health care, environment, oil and gas exploration 
pharmaceutical industries and consumer applications Figure 1 shows a typical RFID system. There are two main components in the system, namely RFID tags and RFID readers An RFID tag is a tiny integrated circuit equipped with an antenna. In the presence of an RFID reader, the tag data Electronic Product Code or EPC  transferred to the reader. Additionally, in the RFID system the reader connects to a middleware 
which is responsible for converting raw tag data into meaningful information. It is also responsible for resolving reader collisions and for ensuring that multiple reads or bad reads are eliminated. The middleware connects to a back-end enterprise system software that utilizes and processes the information retrieved from the tags RFID technology is currently witnessing tremendous growth. IDTechEx estimates that the global RFID market will hit an annual investment of $5.29 billion, with IBM alone investing $250 m v er 
10,000 RFID pilot projects are currently underway worldwide. Many countries are piloting the use of RFID in waste management, environment, supply chain management and airport logistics. Yet, things have barely started. The RFID market is estimated to grow to about $18 billion by  Figure 1: RFID System  worldwide is currently responsible for proposing standards for EPC to support RFID applications. EPCGlobal has envisioned an architecture called the Internet of Things in 
which devices with RFID tags dispersed through the Internet can communicate with each other, providing realtime information about their location, contents, destination and ambient conditions The basic components of the architecture are shown in Figure 2. The RFID reader captures tag and sensor information through the air interface and passes it onto the RFID middleware through the reader protocol.  The middleware is responsible for data smoothing reader coordination, data forwarding, storage and task management. Application level events for a particular EPC or a set of EPCs are activated by the middleware. These are transferred in a secure manner to networked databases.  In 
order to link a given EPC to the object’s database anywhere on the Internet, the architecture consists of the Object Naming Service \(ONS EPC Info Services. ONS is similar to DNS \(Domain Name Service the URL for a given EPC. The architecture also proposes the use of PML \(Physical Markup Language translate static and dynamic data about the object \(such as

The data obtained is classified into different categories that are derived based on the black box model  et al propose a customer  which integrates case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning. Their proposed system classifies potential customers in direct marketing. Their results prove that mining of the unstructured customer purchase information which has both quantitative and qualitative information can be very useful in identifying customer purchase behavior. Similarly, Golding and  rule-based systems through case based reasoning. The central idea of their system is to use a set of rules to any given problem to obtain a default solution We propose a novel RFID system for use by consumer businesses in the retail sector. A common problem in any large grocery store is to make sure the customers find the right product of their choice quickly. The problem gets worse when large grocery stores hold several thousand products and when customers have time constraints; it becomes way too difficult for customers to find the required product quickly. Often customers end up not purchasing the product of their preference just because it is difficult to find and consequently this may directly impact the customer satisfaction of the store. It is also important to warn customers about product information relating to any allergies that they may have. Our proposed system analyses the customers’ purchase strategies to predict the consumer behavior and provide smart customer service. Our proposal uses an RFID-enabled cell phone, which is a hybrid system that integrates the RFID technology with case-based reasoning \(CBR ased reasoning \(RBR suggesting the preferred products to customers and achieve customer satisfaction The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section III describes the design of the proposed system. Section IV gives an overview of the implementation. Section V provides concluding remarks III P ROPOSED S YSTEM Our system is an application-software running on a mobile device such as a cell phone, blackberry, etc. In order to access this application, the customer has to set up a user account and enter his/her personal information like name age, gender, marital status, profession, and any allergy information. Each customer will be given an ID \(Cust_ID which is mapped to their name. The collected customer information is stored in a common table called Customer Table–1, which is used for identifying and categorizing the customers \(Table 1 Table 1 Customer Table -1 The intelligent system uses the customer’s profile to categorize the customer. Here, we identify each category based on at least one or more unique features. This uniqueness is achieved by considering the age range, gender marital or family status \(single, couple, family of 3, family 4 high school student college or university student, professional, full-time Tag Tag Tag with sensor Reader Middleware Application Level Events Networked databases EPC Info Services Discovery services ONS

employee, unemployed, homemaker\ple, a male student, who is single and with an age range 18 to 23, will have a category ID of CC12. A female student, who is single and with the same age range will have a category ID of CC13, at the same time, a female in the same age range who is single but with an Engineering profession will have a different category ID of CC14. Allergy information is stored to make sure the suggested product is safe for the customer These features will define the buyers’ characteristics represented in the black box model proposed by Sandhusen   Our proposed system acts like a customer service staff which understands the customers’ purchase behavior and suggest the appropriate products. The customer purchase behavior is understood by the optimal use of customers previous purchase patterns and by dynamically updating the set of rules for each customer and also for each customer category. For this purpose, we store and retrieve all the customers’ purchase history in the Transaction Table \(Table 2 Table 2 Transaction Table A Transaction Table The transaction table acts as the source case table, which stores all the transactions. The customer transaction table consists of information like date at which the product is purchased, ID of the customer who purchased the product and Product ID of the purchased product and the Product Category. The product ID and the product category are mapped to a Product Table \(Table 3 information about that specific product B Product Table The product table stores information like product ID product category, brand name, price value, quantity value location of the product, and allergy information. Here we consider the price as Price_tag, which defines if the price of M high \(H fall under the same category. The quantity is Quantity_tag which denotes whether the preferred quantity of that product L\hen compared to the list of products which falls under the same category. For example, if a customer’s next preferred product is Milk of quantity value M \(Medium High products that match Pro_Cat = Milk and Price_tag = H and Quant_tag = M and it displays to a maximum of two products which has the highest weights Table 3 Product Table C Weight Calculation Weights are updated at the end of every transaction.  The weights of the next product category that are picked are calculated based on the following formula  P\(s,f ax  1  Pi Previous or current weight of the product  New weight   P\(s,f Probability of success or failure \(1,0 Pmax Maximum weight = 100 Pn Total choices of next product P\(s,f when a customer picks one product category from the next products category list, the weight of that product increases and the weights of the rest of the product decreases when applying the above equation The price and quantity evaluation is done using the same weighting function. Every time a customer picks a product of particular quantity or price, the weight of that quantity or price tag will increase and the rest will decrease when applying the above formula D Customer Table-2 This table \(Table 4 the rule based reasoning. This table stores the primary rules for all the customers for all the products in the store. These rules are generated from the cases. In the example shown in Table 4, if the customer with ID=9000101, who belongs to the customer category CC12, picks a product category P1 then next preferred product category of highest weight is P24 and of second highest weight is P27 with a Price value of L

Table 4 Customer Table-2 In order to suggest products to the customer we need to update the rules \(Customer Table -2 the search process faster and easier. To achieve dynamic update, we have unique tables Customer Table–3 \(to identify the next two preferred products based on weights Evaluation Table \(for price weight evaluation Evaluation Table \(for quantity weight evaluation Table 5 Customer Table-3 E Customer Table-3 In this table \(Table 5 P1, P2, P3, etc. for the sake of simplicity \(example: P1 Milk, P2 - Beverage, P3 - Sauce, etc the next two preferred products based on the current picked product, we search the pervious purchase history, which will contain the total number of times a product P2, P3, etc. is picked after Product P1. Next_Pro1 stores the next preferred product which has the maximum weight \(i.e. the product which is picked the most number of times after the current product which has the second maximum weight \(i.e. the product which is picked the second most after the current product The value of Next_Pro1 and Next_Pro2 will be dynamically updated in the Customer Table-2 based on the values in the Customer Table-3 In order to calculate the weights for price and quantity for each product category we use price evaluation and quantity evaluation table Table 6 Price evaluation Table Price Evaluation table \(Table 6 each product categories’ price weights for all the customers The weights are calculated using the weighting function mentioned before. The price value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2 Table 7 Quantity evaluation Table Quantity evaluation table stores the information of each product categories’ quantity weights for all the customers The weights are calculated similar to the quantity evaluation technique and is increased or decreased based on the number of times that particular item is purchased or rejected. The quantity value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2 In summary, the system initially searches for the next preferred product based on the customer personal preferences and personal purchase history, if a match is not

found, then it search the database for other customers purchase history who fall under the same customer category of this customer. Still if there no matches are found, then we apply general association rules to identity the next preferred product. This is described in the following sub-section F Association Rules In a situation, when the system cannot find similar cases for the customer then the recommendation is done by using association rules.  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and correlation relationships among large sets of data items. Association rule mining is widely used in market based analysis. The data obtained can be used for cross selling, store layouts, etc. An association rule typically is of the form A 002 B where A is an item set and B is an item set that contains only a single atomic condition. According to  percentage of records containing item sets A and B together The confidence of a rule is the percentage of records containing item set A that also contain item set B”. Support here indicates the usefulness of the discovered rules and the confidence is the certainty of the detected association rule Table 8 Association Representation Transaction ID Products TS00001 Bread, Butter, Milk TS00002 Bread, Cheese, Eggs TS00003 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs TS00004 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs TS00005 Milk, Butter, Eggs, Yogurt TS00006 Bread, Cheese, Milk, Eggs Peanut Butter Association rule mining technique finds all collections of items in a database whose confidence and support meet or exceed pre-specified threshold values. For example, Table 8 shows the results of association mining on products that  apriori algorithm for the mining of association rules. The authors use actual sales data to test the feasibility of the algorithm. For our system we intend to extract the transaction information from the transaction table and feed the data into the modified apriori algorithm extract the association rules G Features of the Proposed System Figure 3 shows the summary flowchart of the proposed system 1. Detect the current product picked and display the next product that the customer wishes to purchase 2. Display the location \(aisle its price and quantity 3. Display warnings if the customer is allergic to certain products, based on the information provided by the customer on his/her profile and the product’s ingredient information Figure 3: Summary Flowchart Figure 4: Typical Display on the Cell phone As an example, Figure 4 shows that the first product picked by the customer is Bread, and the system suggests

two next preferred products \(Milk and Eggs decides to purchase the Milk. However, the customer decides to pick Rice, instead of the suggested Eggs. The system automatically identifies the next preferred product after Rice and gives the right suggestion at the same time it updates the database with this new case for future recommendations IV S YSTEM I MPLEMENTATION Figure 5 is the block diagram which explains the system architecture. There are three major components in the system. The RFID tagged consumer product, RFID reader enabled mobile device and the backend enterprise system The backend enterprise system consists of the Intelligent System and the Database.  In a regular scenario, the customer walks into the store with his RFID reader enabled cell phone; he picks a product from the aisle and scans it The RFID reader sends the tag information along with the consumer information to the backend enterprise system for processing. The Backend enterprise system which, consists of two parts i\: Applies the rule-based and case-based reasoning to identify the preferred product ii\atabase: Stores the user profile information and the case base \(previous purchase history processing Figure 5: Block Diagram of System Implementation An RFID reader can be embedded in the mobile device like cell phone, iPhone or blackberry. The data sent by the reader is modulated and backscattered from a number of tags. Passive RFID tags are cost effective and they harvest energy from the reader’s communication signal to power up their operation and communication with the reader. The RFID reader has the capability of reading several products within a few seconds. In a typical supermarket all the products are stored in clusters, if the customer takes the RFID reader enabled cell phone near the aisle, it might read most of the products in the aisle which are in close proximity. This might be a problem in our application because we would like the reader to read just the product picked by the customer in order to recommend the next preferred product. One way to overcome this limitation is to have the user to place the RFID reader enabled cell phone in the shopping cart and have the read range of the RFID reader limited to 10 to 15 cm. Then the customer can scan the product using the RFID enabled cell phone V C ONCLUSIONS We have proposed the design and implementation of an RFID-based system for use by consumer businesses in the retail industry. Our system is able to quickly suggest products to customers based on their preferences using rulebased and case-based reasoning We believe the proposed technique will be more effective if it is store specific, since each store has a unique set of products and unique placement of products in the aisles. Having a store specific approach will also help the business to manage and protect their customer purchase history. The proposed technique can be extended for applications like the library system, pharmaceuticals, air and rail ticket booking system, etc., where the customer will have regular and similar purchase behaviors. The intelligent system will be more effective if we have more customer purchase information, which will help us to clearly understand and get accurate weights for the behaviors. Since RFID technology is still in early implementation stages, we need to consider security issues and traffic congestion issues before implementing it. We would like to test the data to find the accuracy level in each metric like price, quantity and order choice. We are also looking for more hybrid techniques to identify similarity of the patterns in the longterm purchase behavior and short-term purchase behavior and also to identify any change in the purchase behavior based on seasons or other social aspects A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was part of a project on RFID Applications sponsored by Industry Canada.

It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
