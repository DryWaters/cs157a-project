supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules is proposed by utilizing clustering techniques. All the chromosomes use the requirement satisfaction derived only from the representative chromosomes in the clusters and from their own suitability of membership functions to calculate the fitness values. The evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process. The final best minimum supports and membership functions in all the populations are then gathered together for mining fuzzy association rules. Experimental results also show the efficiency of the proposed approach Keywords- data mining, genetic algorithm, genetic-fuzzy mining, multiple minimum supports, membership functions I   I NTRODUCTION  Since the fuzzy theory is a well-known concept to handle 
quantitative data [12  l o t s o f  fuz z y  da t a  m i ni ng approaches have thus been proposed for mining rules from transactions with quantitative values [3, 9, 10  S i n c e th e  minimum supports and membership functions were assumed to be known in advance in these approaches, lots of approaches have been proposed [1, 2, 8  for de ri vi ng membership functions with a uniform minimum support in recent years However, different items should have different minimum supports to judge their importance. A Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports called the GFMMS algorithm s thus been proposed for solving it 5  f i r s t l y   T h e mi n i mu m s u p p o r t s a n d se t s  o f me mb e r s h i p  
functions of all the items were encoded into a chromosome Since the chromosome was quite long in this way, lots of processing time was spent to learn global nearly optimal solutions. A Divide-and-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports   DGFMMS 6  w h i c h c a n d i vid e a n d co nq uer t h e derivation process of the minimum supports and membership functions of different items, have been proposed. However in that approach, the fuzzy value of large 1-itemsets should be found first before calculating the fitness value of each chromosome. Since the transactions thus must be scanned once for each chromosome to get its fitness value, the evolution process is thus time-consuming In this paper, by utilizing the 
k means clustering technique [1 an en h a n c e d ap p r o ach call e d th e Clusterbased Divide-and-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports  CDGFMMS s proposed to speed up the evaluation process and keep nearly the same quality of solutions as that in [6 In th e p r o p o s e d  approach, each chromosome represents a minimum support and set of membership functions for an item used in fuzzy mining. The proposed algorithm first divides the chromosomes in a population into clusters by using the k means clustering approach. All the chromosomes then use the requirement satisfaction derived only from the representative chromosomes in the clusters and from their own suitability of membership functions to calculate the 
fitness values. The evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process. The evaluation results are then utilized to choose appropriate chromosomes for mating. The offspring then undergo recursive evolution until a good minimum support and membership functions have been obtained. Next, the obtained minimum supports and membership functions of all the items are gathered together and used to mine the fuzzy interesting association rules from the given quantitative database [1 E xpe rim e nta l r e sul ts a l s o  sh o w  the  effectiveness of the proposed algorithm II  T HE C OMPONENTS OF T HE P ROPOSED G ENETIC F UZZY M INING 
A PPROACH  A  Chromosome Representation Each individual consists of two parts, respectively for a minimum support and a set of membership functions. The first part encodes the minimum support of a certain item by the real-number schema. Thus, the minimum support of an item I j is encoded with a real number 002 j The second part handles the set of membership functions for an item. It also adopts the real-number schema. Assume the membership functions are triangular. Three parameters c jk1  c jk2 and  c jk3   are thus used to represent a membership function, denoted as 
R jk for item I j A chromosome of item I j can thus be represented as a string of 002 j c j11 c j12 c j13 c j21 c j22 c j23 c jl1 c jl2 c jl3 where c jl3  003  The inequality condition of the center values of the membership functions is c j12  004  c j22  004  004  c jl2   For each membership

function, the inequality condition of the three parameters is c jk1 c jk2   c jk3  B  Initial Population A genetic algorithm requires a population of feasible solutions to be initialized and updated during the evolution process. As mentioned above, each individual within the population is a minimum support and a set of triangular membership functions. Each membership function corresponds to a linguistic term of an item. In this paper, the initial set of chromosomes can be generated according to the initialization information as used in [5  It  in c l u d es a n  appropriate number of linguistic terms, a range of possible minimum supports and a set of membership functions of each item C  The Required Strength of Fuzzy Regions In this paper, the minimum supports of items may be different. It is hard to assign the values. As an alternative, the values can be determined according to the required number of rules. It is, however, very time-consuming to obtain the rules for each chromosome. Usually, a larger number of 1itemsets will result in a larger number of all itemsets with a higher probability, which will thus usually imply more interesting association rules. The evaluation by 1-itemsets is much faster than that by all itemsets or by interesting fuzzy association rules. Using the number of large 1-itemsets can thus achieve a good trade-off between execution time and rule interestingness [8 A criterion should thus be specified to reflect the user preference on the derived knowledge. In our previous paper 5  th e Re q u ir e d Nu m b er o f L a rg e 1 it em sets RNL as thus proposed for this purpose. Given a user-defined percentage p the RNL value for each item could be derived from the number of its linguistic terms and p In this paper we consider that the fuzzy value of each fuzzy region linguistic term\ directly reflects the importance of that region. The Required Strength of Fuzzy regions RSF s then defined here. It is the strength of fuzzy regions that a user wants to get from an item and can be defined as follows p f RSF n i l k i jk I j j  11       where RSF Ij is the RSF value of item I j n is the number of transactions l j is the number of linguistic terms of item I j  f jk i  is the fuzzy membership value of the k th fuzzy region of item I j in the i th transaction, and p is the predefined percentage to reflect usersê preference on the strength of fuzzy regions. A minimum support with which the strength of large fuzzy regions for an item is close to its RSF value is thought of as a good one for that item D  Fitness and Selection In order to develop a good minimum support and a set of membership functions from an initial population, the genetic algorithm selects good parent chromosomes for mating in a probabilistic way. An evaluation function is thus needed to qualify the derived minimum support and membership functions. The fitness function of a chromosome C q is defined as follows        q q q C y Suitabilit C RS C f   where RS  C q is the requirement satisfaction defined as the closeness of the derived strength of fizzy regions of large 1itemsets for chromosome C q to its RSF, suitability  C q  represents the suitability of the membership functions for C q  RS  C q is defined as follows                                   1 1 1 1 L X L X L X L X q RSF X fuzzyValue if X fuzzyValue RSF RSF X fuzzyValue if RSF X fuzzyValue  RS\(C  where RSF is the required strength of fuzzy regions for item I j and fuzzyValue\(X is the fuzzy membership value of the large 1-itemset X from the given transaction database RS\(C q  is used to reflect the closeness degree between the derived strength of fuzzy regions of large 1-itemsets and the required strength of fuzzy regions Suitability  C q represents the shape suitability of the membership functions from C q which consists of overlap and coverage factors. The overlap factor represents the overlapping factor of the membership functions for an item I j  in the chromosome C q The coverage factor represents the coverage ratio of the membership functions for item I j The suitability factor used in the fitness function can reduce the occurrence of the two bad kinds of membership functions where the first one is too redundant, and the second one is too separate. The overlap factor is designed for avoiding the first bad case, and the coverage factor is for the second one More details can be found in [6 E  Clustering Chromosomes From the above section, it is known that the fuzzy value of large 1-itemsets should be found first before the requirement satisfaction for each chromosome is calculated The transactions must thus be scanned once for each chromosome to get its requirement satisfaction Since the evaluation only by fuzzy value of 1-itemsets is still time-consuming, we proposed a method based on the clustering technique to reduce the evaluation time of large 1itemsets in the past with a uniform minimum support [4  It  first used the centers of membership function, coverage factors and overlap factors of all the chromosomes to form appropriate clusters. For each cluster, the chromosome which was the nearest to the cluster center was thus chosen as the representative chromosome to derive its fuzzy support of large 1-itemsets. All chromosomes in the same cluster then used the fuzzy support of large 1-itemsets derived from the representative chromosome as their own. Finally, each chromosome was evaluated by this fuzzy support of large 1itemsets divided by its own suitability value However, each item has its own minimum support in this paper. Thus, using only the two factors \(coverage factor and overlap factor\and centers of membership functions for clustering is not enough. For instance, assume there are two chromosomes with the same centers of membership

functions, coverage and overlap factors but different minimum supports. They may have different numbers of large 1-itemsets due to their different minimum supports The minimum supports of items should thus be considered as an additional attribute for clustering chromosomes Additionally, since the central values of membership functions are quantitative values, we thus normalized the center values into ra b y di vi di ng b y t h e i r m a xi mu m quantitative value in order to balance the influence of each clustering attribute. Thus, assume each item has three membership functions, six attributes including a coverage factor  a overlap factor  a minimum support value and three center values are then used to form appropriate clusters In this paper, the k means clustering approach is adopted Since the chromosomes with similar clustering attributes will form a cluster, their shapes of membership functions will be nearly the same, thus inducing about the same fuzzy values of large 1-itemsets. For each cluster, the chromosome which is the nearest to the cluster center is thus chosen as the representative and used to derive its fuzzy values of large 1itemsets. All chromosomes in the same cluster then use the fuzzy value of large 1-itemsets derived from the representative chromosome as their own. Finally, each chromosome is evaluated by this fuzzy value of large 1itemsets divided by its own suitability value F  Genetic Operators Genetic operators are important to the success of specific GA applications. Two genetic operators, the max-minarithmetical \(MMA\ crossover proposed in [7 a n d t h e  onepoint  mutation are used in the genetic fuzzy mining framework. The max-min-arithmetical \(MMA crossover operator will generate four candidate chromosomes from them. The best two chromosomes of the four candidates are then chosen as the offspring The one-point mutation operator will add a random value   to the minimum support  j in a chromosome. The newly derived minimum support will thus be changed to  j   A new fuzzy membership function will also be created by addition of a random value  to the center or to the spread of an existing linguistic term, say R jk Assume that c jkp  represents a parameter of R jk the parameter of the newly derived membership function may be changed to c jkp    by the mutation operation. Mutation at the fuzzy membership function may, however, disrupt the order of the resulting fuzzy membership functions. These fuzzy membership functions then need rearrangement according to their center values III  T HE P ROPOSED CDGFMMS  A LGORITHM  The proposed cluster-based genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm with divide-and-conquer strategy for mining minimum supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules is described below  INPUT: A body of n quantitative transactions, a set of m  items, a parameter k for k means clustering, a population size P a crossover rate P c a mutation rate P m a crossover parameter d a percentage p  of required strength of fuzzy regions  a break threshold, an interval threshold, and a confidence threshold   OUTPUT: A set of fuzzy association rules with its associated set of minimum supports and membership functions STEP 1: Generate m populations according to the initialization information derived by the clustering procedure stated in f o r an  item; each individual in a population represents a possible minimum support and set of membership functions for that items STEP 2: Calculate the coverage and overlap factors of each chromosome. These two factors are calculated using the formulas defined in Section III STEP 3: Divide the chromosomes into k clusters by the k means clustering approach based on the 3 I j  attributes \(coverage_factor, overlap_factor minimum support and center 1 center 2  center  Ij  here I j is the number of membership functions of item I j Find out the representative chromosome in each cluster which is the nearest to the center STEP 4: Calculate the requirement satisfaction of each representative chromosome by the following substeps STEP 4.1: For each transaction datum D i  i 1 to n and for each item I j  j 1 to m transfer the quantitative value v j i into a fuzzy set   f j i  represented as      012 012      jl i jl j i j j i j R f R f R f   2   2 1   1   using the corresponding membership functions represented by the chromosome where R jk is the k th fuzzy region \(term\ of item I j  f jl i  is v j i s fuzzy membership value in region R jk and l  I j is the number of linguistic terms for I j  STEP 4.2: For each item region R jk calculate its scalar cardinality on the transactions as follows    n i i jk jk f count 1    STEP 4.3: For each R jk 1   j   m and 1   k   I j check whether its count jk  is larger than or equal to the minimum support threshold  which is encoded in chromosome.

The fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in th e n ad opted to ach iev e t h is purpose IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this section, experiments were made to show the performance of the proposed approach A Simulated datasets with 64 items and with 10000 transactions were used in the experiments They were implemented in Java on a personal computer with Intel Pentium IV 3.20GHz and 512MB RAM The initial population size P is set at 50, the crossover rate p c is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate p m is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al s study [7 h e pe rc e n t a g e o f t h e re q u ir ed strength of fuzzy regions is set at 1.0 First, experiments were made to compare the fitness convergence between the proposed approach and DGFMMS  approach [6 A f t e r 500 ge nera t i o n s t h e  r e sul t s  ar e sh o w n i n  Figure 1  Figure 1  The fitness convergences of the DGFMMS approach and the proposed approach with different number of clusters From Figure 1, we can observe that both of them are converged after 500 generations. Besides, when the numbers of clusters are increasing, especially when it is larger than 20 the average fitness values of the proposed approach can achieve nearly the same quality as DGFMMS approach can The experiments were then made to show the speed up ratio of the proposed approach when comparing with DGFMMS The results are shown in Figure 2  Figure 2  The speedup ratio of the proposed approach with different number of clusters From Figure 2, it shows the speedup ratio of DGFMMS  to CDGFMMS in terms of the execution time by varying the number of clusters is from five to thirty. In summary, the proposed approach is thus efficient and effective V  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORKS  In this paper, we have proposed a Cluster-based Divideand-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Approach with Multiple Minimum Supports CDGFMMS to speed up the evolution process of the approach, namely DGFMMS 6 for extracting multiple minimum supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules from quantitative transactions. The proposed approach thus has two advantages: \(1\The first one is that since the scanning database times are reduced, the evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process 2\The second advantage is that although the clustering approach is utilized to estimate the fitness of each chromosome, the proposed approach CDGFMMS still can achieve similar results with the DGFMMS Experimental results also show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the future, we will continuously attempt to enhance the genetic-fuzzy mining framework for more complex problems A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by National Science Council, Taiwan under grant number NSC99-2218-E-032-005 002 and NSC99-2221E390-028  R EFERENCES  1  J.

work a supervised multivariate discretization procedure is presented, which is specially indicated for class association rules \(CARs\. Our proposal evaluates the importance of the attributes on the classification and split simultaneously their values into intervals by means of a procedure that takes as reference the clusters generated by a supervised clustering algorithm. The algorithm produces the most suitable rules for prediction, due to the supervised discretization and the use of the most important attributes in discriminating the different values of the class attribute, which constitutes the consequent part of the rules. Our experiments demonstrated that, in the studied application field, associative classification methods combined with a good discretization procedure overcome widely to the classic supervised learning methods R EFERENCES  1  R.

preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
