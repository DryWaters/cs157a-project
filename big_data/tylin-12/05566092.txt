reduction    I NTRODUCTION  There are many extraction algorithms for classification rule based on concept lattice, but the number and form of extracted rules can not achieve satisfactory results. For example, Godin 1 Wang Zhi-Hai 2 and other scholars respectively proposed the algorithm to extract implication rules by the concept lattice, which are mostly deterministic rules. However, the actual database often contains a lot of errors or uncertain data, thus only a few or even no deterministic rules. And other algorithms may produce a large number of redundant rules of high confidence. This study, borrowing the idea from the references 3 carries out classification through determined and approximate classification rule bases, and proposes content-based synchronization and synchronization of pruning to reduce 
computing classification rule to extract these two types of classification rules, thus effectively reducing the number of classification rules without loss of useful information    R ELATED D EFINITIONS   First give the related definitions of classification rules for intent reduction extraction 4  Definition 1 The determined classification rule base is ER B  r  red c  c

002 RED f\(g red  005 B  Where B is the frequent closed itemset which contains the current class c that is, the connotation of frequent concept\ reduction set for all the frequent closed itemsets     The confidence of the approximate classification rule r  red 004 c is that Con f  r amely, Sup red  c p red hich means that the node containing the antecedent red should be the node that contains the precursor of type c node, which has been discussed in 
definition 1.Therefore, as for approximate classification rules, we only need to consider the precursor node without containing class c  As reference 3 indicates, all valid determined classification rules, including its support and credibility can be deduced from the class association and its support base. Therefore, we should find all determined and approximate classification rule bases which meet the user-specified minimum support and confidence, and then construct a classifier  To extract the determined classification rules, only the lattice nodes containing the current class need to be examined; to extract approximate classification rules, just examine the relationship between nodes containing the current class and its precursor nodes. This study suggests 
generating a section node which includes nodes of the current class and its precursor nodes. On this basis classification rules are extracted     I MPROVED S YNCHRONIZED A LGORITHM OF I NTENT R EDUCTION  In reference 5 the solution to intent reduction based on incremental construction method is put forward. This paper considers extracting determined and approximate classification rule bases. Only intent reduction of two types of nodes are needed. The first class is the node which satisfies the threshold value and contains class c  The second class is the node which meets the threshold 
value and holds the first class node as super-concept node without containing class c In the process of solution to incremental intent reduction, redundant calculation may exist. In order to complete the extraction of classification rules, algorithm and its efficiency need to be further improved. It is necessary to study the change of these two classes of nodes in the incremental process  Set the form background as G M I record MinSup as minimum support threshold value L as the corresponding concept lattice, and L  as the 978-1-4244-5143-2/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


corresponding pruning section lattice, which is the part after deleting the nodes whose extension base is less than the minimum support threshold value MinSup in L It is the the filter of L and the supremum of sub-lattice assume we add attribute m to the background G m g m   G  is a object set with attribute m that is, the new background is G M   m  I  G m  m he concept lattices corresponding to the new background as  L    L  as section lattice after inserting property m in L  and   L  as the pruning section lattice corresponding to   L  Theorem 1  L B A      and 2 1      L L B A    Here 1  L  is the first class node set in L  and 2  L is the second node set in L  Then, the update of    B A  does not affect the reduction of node in 1  L 2  L  Prove that the descendants of the nodes do not change after update of    B A Discuss two circumstances: if    B A  is the updated node, the conclusion is trivial; If it is the generator, mark nCo n as the corresponding new node, and it satisfies the threshold value, obviously      L B A  At this time, if pCon is the parent node in   L There are two cases pCon is the new node, and then pCon can not belong to the set 1  L Since the extension of pCon is more than A only by x it can not belong to set 2  L Otherwise, the super-concept of pCon is also the one of    B A thus    B A being the second class node which is contradictory to 2 1      L L B A   so the conclusion holds up pCon is a updated node, and through similar deduction, we know that pCon does not belong to 2 1   L L  so the conclusion is established       According to theorem 1, the node not belonging to 2 1   L L  in L  does not affect calculation of node reduction. If the node in 1  L is the generator which meets the threshold value or updated node, it’s easy to infer that corresponding new node and updated node still belong to the first class node; If the node in 2  L is the generator which meets the threshold value the father node will be considered   If the corresponding new node is not the second class node, then by the Theorem 1, it is inferred that if the new node needs not be involved in next incremental process, it does not belong to the updated pruning lattice. Then, the nodes not belonging to 2 1   L L  in L   can be directly deleted, and are not involved in the incremental process Then, mark 2 1     L L L     2  1      L L L   that is, the first and second class nodes are obtained after synchronized pruning, during which the dual case should considered. The algorithm is as follows: an improved synchronized algorithm MIIR for intent reduction, based on incremental construction of grid. Figure 1 is a flow chart of algorithm MIIR, and figure 2 is a flow chart of the intent reduction algorithm COMPUTE  Fig. 1   Flow chart of algorithm MIIR  Fig. 2   Flow chart of algorithm COMPUTE  Function JUDGE Con the quotient semi-lattice determines whether Con is the first class node with super-node, if yes, then return true. The return of JUDGE decides whether a certain generator needs producing a new node, thus reducing the computation of the next-round incremental process  Through the above-mentioned synchronized pruning algorithm, the section lattice containing only the first and second class nodes can be obtained. It is still an ideal concept lattice  L so the calculation of node reduction does not change. The above algorithm MIIR realizes the synchronized calculation of intent reduction for the required nodes 


  T HE C LASSIFICATION R ULE E XTRACTION B ASED ON I NTENT R EDUCTION   With the pruning lattice obtained from the above format \(the reduction of each node storing in its ERe d field\e two classification rules are extracted according to definition 1 and 2. Give a classification rule base on pruning lattice to extract CRPL. First, through the above MIIR, we can obtain the section lattice containing only the first and second nodes and the related reduction set Next, save all the first class nodes with T 1 and save the boundary nodes  which have father nodes and belong to the second class nodes in T 1 by use of T 2  Call ERB for T 1 \(flow chart shown in Figure 4\ to extract all the established rules-based classification and then on the T 1 T 2 call ARB \(flow chart shown in Figure 5\ to extract all of the approximate rule-based classification, thus obtaining the required set of classification rules  The flow chart of the extraction of algorithm CRPL based on the rule-based classification of pruning lattice is  shown in Figure 3.

Classifier CSCR is constructed for the above-mentioned classified association rule set by use of method in reference 6 And, six base set in machine learning base UCI is tested, the information of which is shown in Table 1  Fig. 5   Flow chart of algorithm ARB Four cross-validation technique is adopted in this experiment. Minimum support value greatly affects accuracy of the classifier. In experiment, we find that when minimum support value is near 1%, we can obtain a moderate number of rules and the best classifier Therefore, with the minimum support of 1%, minimum confidence of 60%, contrast experiment between the above six data sets and the standard classification method C4.5 is carried out, the result of which is shown in Table 2. The first column is data set, the second, classification accuracy of C4.5, the third, classification accuracy of algorithm Classifier the fourth, the time for extracting algorithm of association rules, and the fifth, the number of extracted classified association rules Table 1   Data sets used in experiments  Date ets N umber of attributes number of Category N umber of objects b reast-w 10 2 699 diabetes 8 2 768 glass 9 7 214 heart 13 2 270 iris 4 3 150 p ima 8 2 768  As can be seen from Table 2, classification accuracy in algorithm CSCR is higher than that of C4.5 in four of the six data sets under experiment, especially in data set glass, and it’s lower than that of C4.5 in only two data sets. In the six data sets the mean classification accuracy is: CSCR 83.8%, and C4.5 81.58%, that is, the classification method put forward in this study is better 


than the standard C4.5 method. In addition, with regard to the time needed, four data sets are carried out fast, with the average time of 1.4 s. The needed time is a little longer, in the two data sets breast-w and heart for the number of extracted rules is larger. However, the average time is still less than 8s, which is improved compared with the speed in reference 7  Table 2   Results of algorithm CSCR and C4.5 Data sets C4.5 CSCR Time Number of rules breast-w 95.0 96.3 28.7 307 diabetes 74.2 73.1 2.6 35 glass 68.7 81.1 1.3 49 heart 80.8 83.2 10.9 528 iris 95.3 96.1 0.4 19 pima 75.5 73.0 1.2 25 Average value 81.58 83.8 7.52 160.5   C ONCLUSION  To sum up, it is effective to propose a classified association rule method based on incremental lattice construction and sync calculations of intent reduction Compared with that in references 3 and 5 this algorithm is improved in the following two aspects. Firstly, the range of nodes for computing intent reduction is restricted namely, only nodes related to computation and classified rule extraction are needed Secondly, since incremental computation was carried out ahead for the needed intent reduction, the extraction of these two classification rules can be given according to the foregoing definitions, thus improving the efficiency of rule extraction. In future more data sets are to be tested to further improve the proposed method in this study  R EFERENCES   1 G o din R M i s s a o u i R  A n i n cr e m e n tal co nce p t f o r m at io n a ppr o a ch  for learning from databases[C T he o r e tical Co m p u t e r S c ie n c e  S p e c i al  Issue on Formal Methods in Databases and Software Engineering October 1994, 133: 387-419 2 W a ng Z h ih ai H u K e y un, H u X u e g ang  Etc  g e ne r a l r u l e ex tr actio n  algorithms and incremental algorithms based on Concept lattices [J Chinese Journal of Computers, 1999, 22\(1\: 66-70 3 i H o ng L i u D a y o u L i u Y a bo  U s e r as s o ciat io n m i n i ng  bas e d o n  Concept lattices [J C o m p ut er Sc i e nc e 200 4  3 1  Z 2  16 1  4 X i e Zhi p en g, L i u Zon g t i a n   C oncep t L a t t ic e and A s s o c i at i on R u les  J   J o u r na l of C o m p u t er R e s e a r c h a n d  Develop m en t  20 00  37  1 2    1415-1421 5 L i u B  H s u W  M a Y  I n te g r ating cl assif i cat io n an d asso ci at io n r u l e  mining[C Proc eed i n gs of th e Sec o n d I n t e rn a t i o n a l C o n f eren c e on  Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, New York, 1998: 80-86 6 u K e y un L u Y u c h a n g  S h i C h uny i cl as s i f i ca tio n  an d t h e  integration of mining association rules based on Concept lattices J o u r n al o f S o f t w a r e 200 0 1 1  11   14 7 8 1 48 4

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
