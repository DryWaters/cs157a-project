Research on Mining Positive and Negative Association Rules Based on Dual Confidence    Xiufeng Piao College of Computer Science and Technology Harbin Engineering University Harbin , China xfpiao@126.com  Zhanlong Wang College of Computer Science and Technology Harbin Engineering University Harbin , China wangzhanlong@hrbeu.edu.cn  Gang Liu College of Computer Science and Technology Harbin Engineering University Harbin , China liugang@hrbeu.edu.cn  Abstract Mining of association rules has become an important area in the research on data mining. However the traditional approaches based on support-confidence framework maybe generate a great number of redundant and wrong association rules. In order to solve the problems , a correlation measure is 
defined and added to the mining algorithm for association rules. According to the value of correlation measure association rules are classified into positive and negative association rules. Therefore,the new algorithm can mine the negative-item-contained rules. In the paper, the algorithm which based on the correlation and dual confidence, can mine the positive and negative association rules.The experimental result shows that positive and negative association rules mining algorithm can reduce the scale of meaningless association rules, and mine a lot of interesting negative association rules Keywords data mining; positive and negative association rules; dual confidence; minimum correlation I  0 B I NTRODUCTION  Association rules was proposed by Rakesh Agrawal et al 1 in  1 9 9 3 f o r  in itia lly w h ich is an  im p o r tan t t ech n i q u e in  data mining. Traditional association rules, mainly for mining 
customer transaction database relationship between sets of items, that is of the form A B 000 high frequency, high correlation rules, which we call positive association rules, is a strong correlation of the dominant model, and there are many mining algorithms[2  I n fa ct m a n y d a t a ba se s w h i c h use these mining technology can not find the hidden patterns one of these important hidden pattern is the negative association rules, which has a low frequency and strong correlations, showing the H property H of the strong correlations in the data itemsets which is hard to find. The rules tell us that which data items less to occur together, and they share a very strong correlation, and contain very valuable information, such as rules  A B 000  001 A B  
000 001 A B  000  so mining negative association rules is very important Currently used for the negative association rules mining algorithm is not too much, such as pro p o s ed a po si t i v e and negative association rules mining algorithm based on interestingness,a negative association rules mining algorithm based on support, confidence, correlation coefficient in and a negative association rules mining algorithm based on matrix in [5   Negative association rules of the search space for all nonfrequent itemsets, and the non-frequent itemsets in the database D is exponential, which is also the main reason of study negative association rules more difficult than  positive association rules.While obtained the support of all nonfrequent itemsets is unrealistic, but also meaningless. For example, for the negative association rules 
A B 000   AB 002 is the non-frequent itemsets, but both A and B are frequent itemsets, Therefore, a negative association rules mining can be divided into two sub-problems 0017 the database D find all the frequent itemsets L  0018 Determine negative association rules based on frequent itemsets L  There are many algorithms can be used directly to solve the first sub-problems, such as the Apriori algorithm, FP-growth algorithm. This paper gives a negative association rules mining algorithm to find hidden rules in massive data Negative association rules are used to discover the meaningful association beteween the itemsets and others in the large data,  giving the interesting relationship between 
these items II  1 B P ROBLEM  FORMULATION  Set I  i R 1 R  i R 2 R  i R m R that contains a collection of m different items. Given a transaction database D where each transaction T is a group itemsets of I If A is a subset of I with A T 003 we can say that a transaction T contains A A negative association rules are an implication of the form A B  000 or A B 000  or 
A B  000  ere  A BT 003 and AB 004=\005  Given support s and confidence c If D has \(100 s of the transaction contains B but does not contain A the support of negative association rules A B  000 is s denoted as sup  A B  000  s If the transaction does not contain A there are \(100 c of the transaction contains B the confidence 
of negative association rules A B  000 is c denoted as conf  A B  000  c So the support and confidence of negative association rules A B 000  001 A B  000  can also be defined Negative association rule discovery seeks rules of the form A B  000 or A B 000  or A B  000    with support and

confidence greater than, or equal to, user-specified minimum support minsup and minimum confidence minconf  thresholds respectively, where A and B are frequent itemsets In this paper,  introducting the minimum correlation theory so it can reduce the production of the meaningless association rules III  2 B A LGORITHM D ESIGN  A  4 B Confidence With goods A 001 B by sup\(A and sup\(B small \(e.g. less than 5%\ then sup A 002 B aller , while the confidence  conf A B 000 may be large, may also be small, but  conf A B  000  positive large. If the uniform rules for all the confidence bound, there will be such an embarrassing situation: If the less confidence, would be a lot of rules, the customer can not choose the genuine needs of the rules, even presence of a large A B  000  type rules are not necessarily meaningful; if confidence is greater, may miss many valuable positive association rules. Therefore, the best solution is to use different confidence thresholds, and we set two confidence thresholds P_minconf and N_minconf  P_minconf show that the minimum confidence threshold of the rules A B 000 and A B  000   N_minconf show that the minimum confidence threshold of the rules A B 000  and A B  000  Property 1 Let AI 006  B I 006  AB 004=\005 then 0017 sup  A  1  sup  A   0018 sup  AB 002  sup  B   sup  AB 002  0019 sup  AB 002  sup  A   sup  AB 002  001 sup  AB 002 1  sup  A   sup  B  sup  AB 002  Property 2  Let AI 006  B I 006  AB 004=\005 then conf  A B 000   sup  sup  sup  A AB A 002  1   conf A B  000  conf  A B  000  sup  sup  1 sup  B AB A 002   1 sup  sup  sup   1sup A BAB conf A B A 002  000    1   conf A B  000  Where  conf X as the confidence function, such as  conf A B  000 is the confidence of negative association rules A B  000  The relationship between them as follows 1  conf A B 000   conf A B 000  1 2  conf A B  000   conf A B  000  1 Proof omitted We can see from the above analysis, the two confidence P_minconf  N_minconf 1 B  5 B Correlation Most association rules mining algorithms use the framework of support-confidence. Although it may exclude some meaningless rules, it still produce some rules which the users are not interested in. Suppose there are 10000 sales data items in the set , purchase of goods X denoted as the item A purchase of goods Y denoted as the item B purchase of X and Y denoted as item A 002 B Assume the purchase of goods X is 6000, purchase of goods is 5000, purchase of goods X and Y are 2500.Given minsup 0.2 minconf 0.3,then sup  A B 002 0.25 minsup   conf A B 000 0.42 minconf so A B 000 is a strong association rules. Then considering negative association rules A B 000  since sup  A 002 B 0.35  minsup   conf A B 000  0.58 minconf therefore A B 000   also is strong association rules. This is in contradiction with the A B 000 meanwhile, because of   conf A B 000     conf A B 000 so A B 000  should be more reliable Because of   conf A B 000  P  000 003 000    PB  the occurrence of A lead to probability B is decreased, so A and B should be a negative relation. For this, it introduced another measure of association rules - Correlation The correlation of association rules show the relationship between the itemset.,through the correlation threshold, we can remove some meaningless  negative association rules Definition 3.1  If    PA B PAPB 002 then itemsets A  and itemsets B are independent; Otherwise, itemsets A and itemsets B are correlated The correlation of itemsets A and itemsets B   sup  sup  sup  AB corr A B A B 002  Which  AB corr is the correlation of itemsets A and B  sup  A 002 B  001 sup  A  001 sup  B respectively, the support of itemsets A 002 B 001 A and B  There are three kinds of  AB corr  If  AB corr 0,then itemsets A and B is positive correlation If  AB corr 0,then itemsets A and B is negative correlation If  AB corr 0,then itemsets A and B is independent of each other The correlation reflects the relationship between the itemsets A and B when the correlation is equal to 0 indicating that two itemsets appear together does not have special meaning, namely A and B are independent of each other, called the rules are not relevant rules; when the correlation less than 0, indicating that the possibility one of the itemsets would be decreased by another itemsets T called the rules are negative correlation rules T when the correlation greater than 0, indicating that the possibility one of the itemsets would be increased by another itemsets T called the rules are positive correlation rules T  Because of the meaning expressed by the three cases vary widely, according to the traditional rules generated by Apriori algorithm is no distinction for them T so some rules are contradictory or uninteresting

The paper [6 r op os ed  th at if  a ru les  t o  m eet sup  A 002 B   sup  A  sup  B  001 0, then the rules are  no interesting, in other words, only the correlation of rules is greater than a certain threshold, the user will be interested in, Therefore, we set the minimum correlation threshold mincorr that only the association rules to meet sup  A 002 B   sup  A  sup  B  007 mincorr is our interest mincorr specified by the user or expert. For the negative association rules, the value of sup  A 002 B   sup  A  sup  B ay be less than 0, therefore, it need to join the absolute value on the left of the formula, that is, if A 000 B is interested in the rules, if and only if 003 sup  A 002 B    sup  A  sup  B  003 007 mincorr The following will discuss the relationship between the minimum correlation of four forms of association rules Theorem 3.1 If 003 sup  A 000 B   sup  A  sup  B  003 007 mincorr then 1 003 sup   A 000 B   sup   A  sup  B  003 007 mincorr  2 003 sup  A 000  B   sup  A  sup   B  003 007 mincorr  3 003 sup   A 000  B   sup   A  sup   B  003 007 mincorr  Proof.  \(1 003 sup   A 000 B   sup   A  sup  B  003   003 sup  B  002 sup  A 001 B    sup  B  002 sup  A  sup  B  003   003  sup  A 001 B  sup  A  sup  B  003   003 sup  A 000 B   sup  A  sup  B  003 007 mincorr  2\ \(3\he same reason The theorem show that select an appropriate minimum correlation can be prune to four association rules C  Algorithm Design In the PAR&NAR_Mining algorithm, assuming that the frequent itemsets have been obtained and saved in the set L  Input: frequent itemsets L minimum confidence minconf  the minimum correlation mincorr  Output: positive association rules set of PAR, negative association rules set of NAR PAR 005 NAR 005  For any frequent itemsets X in L do begin For any itemsets A 002 B  X and A  004 B  005  do begin If 003 sup  A  002 B   sup  A  sup  B  003 007 mincorr do begin If  AB corr  0 then begin   // Produce rules forms such as A 000 B and  A 000  B  If conf  A 000 B  007 P_minconf then PAR=PAR 002  A 000 B  If conf  A 000  B  007 P_minconf then NAR=NAR 002   A 000  B  End If  AB corr 0 then begin   // Produce rules forms such as A 000  B and  A 000 B  If conf\(A 000  B  007 N_minconf then NAR=NAR 002  A 000  B  If conf  A 000 B  007 N_minconf then NAR=NAR 002   A 000 B  End End End End Return PAR and NAR The algorithm to generate T positive T association rules set PAR and negative association rules set NAR.

proles that only appear in the potentially corrupted dataset and stand out from others because of the values of both measures will be considered as malicious intruders Once these proles are completely removed from the dataset a new iteration of the process would start with the elapse of time In the Mobashers example Item6 was clearly identied as an attacker Thus according to Table I we just need to know which users voted for Item6 with a high score if a push attack is considered Attacker1-3 are the malicious users that interfere in the normal behaviour of the user-based recomendation system III E XPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS Several different experiments have been carried out to detect potential attacks over an user-based recommendation system With this purpose in mind the aforementioned variation of the G3PARM algorithm was executed using a specic rating-based dataset Moreover the whole approach proposed in Section II has been followed All the experiments used in this study have been performed on an Intel Core i7 machine with 12Gb main memory and running CentOS 5.4 The algorithm proposed has been written in Java using JCLEC a J a v a library for evolutionary computation In the following sections we describe the dataset used detail the experimental set-up and introduce a brief description of the attack proles injected for the experimentation Finally we show the results obtained by different experiments A D ata s et and experimenta ls et-up In our experiments we used the free available Jester dataset Anonymous Ratings from the online Jester Online Joke Recommender System 1  This dataset consists of 4.1 million continuous ratings of 100 jokes from 73,421 users Table V summarizes the conguration parameters used for the experimentation TABLE V E XPERIMENTATION SET UP  Parameter Value Population size 50 individuals Number of generations 100  012\012 0.9  015 0.2 Maximum number of derivations CFG 24 Auxiliary population size 30 individuals Condence threshold 0.9 Minimum suppport threshold 0.0005 Maximum suppport threshold 0.125   10   10 B Execution of the RARM a lg orithm In order to obtain a diverse set of association rules ve different executions of the G3PARM modied algorithm have been carried out with ve different seeds Once the G3PARM 1 Jester Collaborative Filtering Dataset http://goldberg.berkeley.edu jester-data algorithm reaches a certain number of generations 100 generations in our proposal individuals from the auxiliary population are returned As explained before this population comprises the best individuals i.e those that exceed a minimum threshold of condence and support and have a support value less than a maximum threshold Finally the set of rules obtained from the auxiliary population are normalized by using the post-processing step implemented in this G3PARM algorithm version Table VI shows the average support and condence of the rules obtained in each experiment The value   is the number of rules that compose the auxiliary population once the algorithm reaches the maximum number of generations TABLE VI A VERAGE RESULTS FOR EACH MEASURE PER EXECUTION Support Condence N Rules Experiment1 0.0340 0.9796 146 Experiment2 0.0324 0.9864 146 Experiment3 0.0431 0.9742 149 Experiment4 0.0312 0.9814 149 Experiment5 0.0499 0.9835 148 Average 0.0381 0.9810 147.6000 Finally we present some signicant rules obtained in this rst step of the intruder detection process described in this paper Ru l e1      012                  012      Ru l e1 norma l ized           012       012      Ru l e2          012  012               012   Ru l e2 norma l ized         012  012                012   These rules show the infrequent ratings of 100 different jokes Scores are bound from 10 i.e the user dislikes the item to 10 i.e the user likes the item C  Attack injection As we know the main goal of an attacker is to distort the normal behavior of a ltering recommender system in order to promote or demote a specic item Formally a proleinjection attack has a set of proles added to the system through an attacker with different ctitious user identities To 686 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s 


conceal the real intentions of an attacker it is necessary to rate items that are not the target item This paper is focused on the use of push attacks that consist in promoting an item selected by adding high ratings to the target item It also requires some ller rating in order to simulate a normal user behavior e.g rating the most popular items There are many ways to create a push attack 17  Random attack  This attack assigns the highest rating to the target item and random ratings to the ller items  Avera g e attack  In this attack a previously knowledge about the system is required The average rating of each item is assigned to each ller item In order to promote the target item the highest rating is assigned to this item  Bandwa g on attack  The attacker inserts some ller ratings like the random attack but also high rating in the most frequently rated items This model allows the association between the most visibility items and the target item  Se g ment attack  This attack tries to reduce the knowledge needed to create a push attack by pushing an item to a group of users with specic preferences Focusing on the average attack and in order to create this kind of attacks see Figure 4 a set of ller items    are randomly chosen and a random rating is generated in the domain 015            being the average rating for the item  and  being its standard deviation On the other hand the highest rating is assigned to the target item This process must be repeated in order to generate a set of attack proles the attack size The cardinality of the set      can also be different In our experiments we created six attacks with different  values over three items with a low number of highest rating joke58 joke74 and joke79 The attack size used in these experiments was 2500 that approximately represents the 10 of the dataset size Then every new attack prole is inserted into the dataset and a new dataset with an attack injection dataset is obtained  Filler items Target item Null items l i n-l-i n items I f I o I t Fig 4 Average attack schema D  D etection of s u s piciou s attacker s Once we have the dataset and a set of rare association rules we analyze the rating patterns For each experiment we obtain a subset of rules that have undergone a signicant change in some attributes higher than a user-dened threshold probability For these rules the 015\012 measure will indicate the current item attacked With a threshold probability of 80 more than 30 rules were obtained as shown in Table VII All of these rules present the item attacked in their expression with 92 or 100 of attack probability In this case no rules with a signicant change in a ller item have been found The values of the 015\012 measure are always higher than zero in the attacked items For the rest of attributes ller items less than zero values are obtained so the suspicious item the item with a high attack probability is really the attacked item TABLE VII N UMBER OF RULES WITH THE ATTACKED ITEM P  0.8 Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 3232323232 Joke74 3737373737 Joke79 3636363636 Using this threshold probability the number of ller items inserted in the dataset is not signicant because the number of rules obtained for each  value is the same With a high value of the threshold probability only the attacked item presenting a great change in the corrupted dataset will exceed this threshold because the ller items are inserted with a less frequency than the target item If we change the threshold probability to 50 some new rules are found with the item attacked Table VIII If the number of ller items increases   takes values over 50 there will be some ller items that will appear in the new dataset close to the frequency of the target item Thus these items can be confused with the items attacked Table IX shows the number of rules with a higher change than the threshold probability caused by the high appearance of ller items in the attack In these cases the ller items can be considered to be attacked items because their attack probability is higher than the real target item probability When this happens the 015\012 measure gives us the current inuence of the attack in the dataset For example one of the association rules obtained in our experiments has one ller item with a probability to be an attack of 50 and the target item of 20 Yet the inuence measures obtained were 0.006 for the ller item and 0.022 for the target item TABLE VIII N UMBER OF RULES WITH THE ITEM ATTACKED P  0.5 Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 4444444444 Joke74 3737373737 Joke79 3939393939 TABLE IX N UMBER OF RULES WITH FILLER ITEMS Attacked item 015 20 015 30 015 40 015 50 015 60 Joke58 0 0 0 51 265 Joke74 0 0 0 81 279 Joke79 0 0 0 143 359 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s 687 


IV C ONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK This position paper has shown a novel proposal for the detection of malicious attack injections in user-based recommendation systems A core step in this process consists in mining infrequent combinations of user ratings on items e.g movies books music and so on With this purpose we have introduced a variation of our previous algorithm G3PARM that is specially devoted to rare association rule mining Since G3PARM is an evolutionary algorithm that uses G3P we have taken advantage of some important characteristics aforementioned such as its adaptability to the scope of application as well as its scalability which allows it to face up to large datasets comprising a great deal of attributes or items Precisely this latter point is an usual shortcoming of current attack detection proposals The attack probability   and the 015\012 measure used in the analysis of the rating patterns allows us to extract the suspicious attacked items state the real inuence of these items and nally extract the target item that the attacker promoted In our experiments both the attacked items and some ller items were catalogued as suspicious but the ller items are discarded later thanks to the inuence measure As a future work we plan to test different types of attacks because CRD are susceptible to a wide range of attacks In this respect we will be able to prove our new detection process in more complex attack injections like the bandwagon attack Although most of the current proposals analyzed datasets with attacks we also propose to explore how this method would react in non-simulated environments i.e where the increment of the dataset presents both usual rating proles and attacker proles A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported by Spanish Research Projects P08-TIC-3720 TIN2008-06681-C06-03 and FEDER founds R EFERENCES  F  Zhang L Bai and F  Gao AU s er Tru s t-Ba s ed C o ll aborative Fi l terin g Recommendation A lg orithm  2009 pp 411424  C W illiams B Mobasher  R  B urk e and R  Bhaumik D etectin g Pro l e Injection Attack s in C o ll aborative Fi l terin g A Cl a ss iÞcation-Ba s ed Approach  2007 pp 167186  C W illiams B Mobasher  a nd R Burk e Defending Recommender Systems Detection of Prole Injection Attacks Service Oriented C omputin g and App l ication s  vol 1 no 3 pp 157170 2007  S X W u and W  Banzhaf The use of computational intelligence in intrusion detection systems A review App l ied Soft C omputin g  vol 10 no 1 pp 135 2010  B Mobasher  R  B urk e R Bhaumik and C  W illiams T o w ard T rustworthy Recommender Systems An Analysis of Attack Models and Algorithm Robustness A C MTran s  Internet Techno l   vol 7 no 4 p 23 2007  V  Chandola A Banerjee and V  K umar   Anomaly Detection A Survey A C M C omput Surv  vol 41 no 3 pp 158 2009  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases in Proceedin gs of the 1993 A C M SIGMO D Internationa lC onference on Mana g ement of D ata SIGMO D 93  Washington D.C 1993 pp 207216  C Bor gelt Ef cient Implementations of Apriori and Eclat  i n 1 s t Work s hop on Frequent Item s et Minin g Imp l ementation s FIMIÕ03  Melbourne Florida USA 2003  F  Bodon A T i re-based APRIORI Implementation for Mining Frequent Item Sequences in 1 s t Internationa l Work s hop on Open Source D ata Minin g  Frequent Pattern Minin g Imp l ementation  2005 pp 5665  J Han J Pei Y  Y i n and R Mao Mining Frequent P atterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach D ata Minin g and Know l ed g e D i s cover y  vol 8 pp 5387 2004  J M Luna J R Romero and S V entura G3P ARM A Grammar Guided Genetic Programming Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in IEEE Wor l d C on g re ss on C omputationa l Inte ll i g ence W CC I 2010  Barcelona Spain 2010 pp 25862593  Y  K o h a nd N Rountree Findin g Sporadic Ru l e s U s in g Apriori-Inver s e  2005 pp 97106  L Szathmary  A  N apoli and P  V altche v  T o w ards Rare Itemset Mining in 19th IEEE Internationa lC onference on Too ls with ArtiÞcia l Inte ll i g ence I C TAI 07  vol 1 2007 pp 305312  L T r oiano G Scibelli and C Birtolo  A Fast Algorithm for Mining Rare Itemsets in Proceedin gs of the Ninth Int l  C onference on Inte ll ig ent S ys tem sD e s i g n and App l ication s  2009 pp 11491155  J R K o za Genetic Pro g rammin g  On the Pro g rammin g of C omputer s b y Mean s of Natura l Se l ection  C omp l ex Adaptive S ys tem s  TheMIT Press December 1992  S V e ntura C Romero A Zafra J Delgado and C Herv  as J C LE C  a Framework for Evo l utionar yC omputation  ser Soft Computing Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2007 vol 12 pp 381392  S Lam and J  Riedl Shilling recommender systems for fun and prot  in Proceedin gs of the 13th Internationa l WWW C onference NewYork NY 2004 688 20 1 0 1 0 t h I nt er nati o na lCo nf ere n ce o n I nt ell i ge nt S ys t e m sDes i g nan dA pp l i c ati o n s

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
