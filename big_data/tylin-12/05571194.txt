It has been widely used in many practices, such as fraud detection, marketing analysis, medical analysis and network intrusion. In the field of data mining, there are many useful methods of outlier detection [3-6  T h ey  are u s ef u l  tech n i qu es on ou tli e r  
detection available for numerical data. However, they perform not well in discrete data or transaction data. This paper proposes a method especially for dicovering outliers in discrete datasets, which performs well in transaction datasets and is efficent and easy to implement In this paper, we focus on the method of outlier detection based on frequent patterns \(FP method for short\. First we describe the core algorithm and analyze the drawback of this method, and then we propose an improved method \(LFP method for short\ and also present its algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the two methods by using several datasets and the experiment results show that the LFP method outperforms the FP method This paper mainly makes the following contributions

In other words, if a data object contains more frequent patterns, it means that this data object is unlikely to be an outlier 1  FPOF Measure for Outliers FP method defines a measure called 
FPOF that reflects the normal degree of a transaction. Let F be a complete set of frequent itemsets mined from input data with a given threshold min_sup and let sup\(X be a support value of an frequent itemset X and X 002 F The normal degree FPOF\(t of a transactions t is derived as  sup  FPOF\(t  XtXF X F 003\004 002 000 1 The numerator of this formula \(1\ represents the sum of support degree of all frequent patterns contained in 
transaction X The denominator defines the number of frequent patterns that F contains. Therefore, a transaction that contains more frequent patterns is more normal, while one that contains less frequent patterns is more abnormal and more possible to be an outlier 2  FP Algorithm This FP algorithm is listed in Table 004 First the algorithm generates the frequent pattern set F from the dataset with a given minisupport. Then, for each transaction t  in the dataset T traverse every frequent pattern X in F if

Therefore when FP algorithm is used to compute t s FPOF value, the support degrees of X and X s subsets are duplicate added This duplicate computing will enlarge the differentials of normal degrees among transactions. In such a case, the outlier measure FPOF cannot reflect the normal degree of transactions accurately Targeting at the above drawback of FP method, we propose an improved method, named LFP method. LFP method redefines the outlier measure and has solved duplicate added problem well, so this method could detect outliers more precisely and increase the rate of accuracy III  A N I MPROVED M ETHOD  A  LFPOF Measure for Outliers We assume that here exist frequent pattern fp1  I1, I3 I5, I6  002 fp2  I3, I5  002 fp3  I5, I6 and fp1 005 fp2 002 fp1 005 fp3  then frequent pattern fp1 is defined as a superset frequent pattern of fp2 and fp3 frequent pattern fp2 and fp3 are defined as subsets frequent pattern of fp1  Importantly in the frequent pattern mining process, a superset frequent pattern that contains more items \(has long length\s combined by subset frequent pattens that contains less items \(has short length\. So the longer a superset frequent pattern is, the more its subset frequent patterns are Then we could conclude that a transaction that contains longer superset frequent patterns is more likely to be a normal transaction because it has more subset frequent patterns than other transactions. In contrast, a transaction that contains short frequent patterns is more likely to be an outlier According to the above idea, we define a new measure called LFPOF that reflects the normal degree of a transaction. Let t be a transaction in T let F be a complete set of frequent itemsets F\(t is a frequent pattern set which composes of  frequent patterns contained in t  F\(t is derived as F\(t  X  X 002 F 004  t 005 X  Let X max be the longest frequent pattern in F\(t  X max  represents the length of X max  t represents the length of transaction t then we have   max    X LFPOF t t  2 The numerator shows that a transaction contains longer frequent pattern is more normal B  LFP Algorithm This LFP algorithm is shown in Table 004 The process of LFP algorithm is as follows.

Then order all the transactions by their LFPOF  value in ascend.

The time complexity of generating frequent pattern set using FP-growth algorithm increases fast as the scale of the transaction dataset gets larger. When the scale of dataset is extremely large, the algorithm’s computational time will get quite long. Anyway FP-growth algorithm is much more efficent than Apriori algorithm. The double circulation has O\(|T|×|F time complexity. When T and F are getting larger, the running time of algorithm is getting longer, however, this O\(|T|×| F  time complexity is acceptable as long as T and F are limited in certain scale

IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this section, we make experiments to compare FP method and LFP method on the detecting accuracy. We run the two algorithms on 3 real world datasets all obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [10   A  Experimental Environment The experimental environments: Windows XP 002 Intel\(R 2.66GHz CPU 002 1G main memory and JDK 1.6.0 B  Data Sets These 3 datasets are: Intrusion dataset, breast-cancerwinsconsin dataset, lymphography dataset Intrusion dataset is a network connection records dataset that includes a variety of intrusions from U.S. military Attributes include length of the connection, the type of protocol, network service on the destination and so on, each record is classified into the normal class or one of the intrusion classes such as guess password, warezmaster and so on. Most attributes take continuous values, we discretize them into 5 levels using AlphaMiner [11 s o f t w a re  T h e  treated experimental dataset is combined of the guess password class as the true outlier records and the normal records. It contains 97% normal records and 3% outlier records, in total 1000 records. We converted this record data to transaction data in which each item corresponds to a pair of an attribute and its value. The final experimental dataset is shown in Table 004  TABLE III  C LASS D ISTRIBUTION OF I NTRUSION DATASET  Class Number Percentage Total number Normals 970 97 1000 Outliers 30 3 The second dataset used is breast-cancer-winsconsin dataset, which contains 699 records with 9 attributes. All attributes are considered as categorical. Each record was labeled as benign or malignant. In our experiment, We pick up 14 records \(3%\ of the malignant records and 443 records 97%\f the benign records. The 14 malignant records are treated as outliers and others are normal records. The final transaction form dataset is listed in Table 004  TABLE IV  C LASS D ISTRIBUTION OF BREAST CANCER WINSCONSIN DATASET  Class Number Percentage Total number Normals 443 97 457 Outliers 14 3 The third dataset is the Lymphography data set, which contains 148 records with 18 attributes. All records in the dataset are categorized into 4 classes. Classes 2 and 3 have the largest number of records. The remained classes were regarded as outlier class labels. The corresponding class distribution is illustrated in Table 004  TABLE V  C LASS D ISTRIBUTION OF LYMPHOGRAPHY DATASET  Class Number Percentage Total number Normals 142 96 148 Outliers 6 4 C  Accuracy Comparisons In order to evaluate LFP method proposed by this paper we adopt Kazuyo Narita’s experiment method t o  compare FP method and LFP method. We take two accuracy measures, the detection rate \(D_rate\ and detection precision D_prec\ defined by the following formulas number of detected true outliers D_rate  number of all true outliers  number of detected true outliers D_prec  number of detected transactions as outliers  For fair evaluation, we provide fixed parameters for each method, and regard transactions which have the top-k lowest normal degree as outliers. Changing the k value, we draw a comparison chart. Fig. 1 shows the change in D_prec as D_rate increases of two methods, and the horizontal axis of this figure represents detection rate, the vertical axis represents detection precision. The parameter min_sup is set 50%, which is most proper for the two methods. We could find that LFP method’s D_prec keeps maintaining higher values than FP method as the D_rate increases \(or k value increases\, especially under the circumstance that D_rate is quite low. Through this phenomenon we can deduce that the top outliers detected by FP method contain much normal records so that its detection precision gets low. In contrast when D_rate is quite low, LFP’s D_prec is quite high because the top outliers detected by LFP method are almost correct. Therefore, we can see that LFP method gets a higher accuracy than FP method 000$\000F\000F\000X\000U\000D\000F\000\\\000\003\000&\000R\000P\000S\000D\000U\000L\000V\000R\000Q\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000/\000\\000$\000O\000J\000R\000U\000L\000W\000K\000P\000\003\000D\000Q\000G\000\003\000\\000J\000R\000U\000L\000W\000K\000P\000\003\000\013\000,\000Q\000W\000U\000X\000V\000L\000R 000Q\000\014 000\023 000\024\000\023 000\025\000\023 000\026\000\023 000\027\000\023 000\030\000\023 000\031\000\023 000\032\000\023 000\033\000\023 000\034\000\023 000\024\000\023\000\023 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\024\000\030\000\025\000\023\000\025\000\030\000\026\000\023\000\026\000\030\000\027\000\023\000\027\000\030\000\030\000\023\000\030\000\030\000\031\000\023\000\031\000\030\000\032\000\023\000\032\000\030\000\033\000\023\000\033\000\030\000\034\000\023\000\034\000\030\000\024\000\023\000\023 000'\000H\000W\000H\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\0005\000D\000W\000H\000\013\000\010\000\014 000'\000H\000W\000H\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\0003\000U\000H\000F\000L\000V\000L\000R\000Q\000\013\000\010\000\014 000/\000\\0003\000\013\000P\000L\000Q\000B\000V\000X\000S\000 \000\030\000\023\000\010\000\014 000\\000\013\000P\000L\000Q\000B\000V\000X\000S\000 \000\030\000\023\000\010\000\014  Figure 1  Accuracy Comparison between LFP Algorithm and FP Algorithm \(Intrusion In the second experiment, we use breast-cancerwinsconsin dataset and the result is shown in Fig. 2 000$\000F\000F\000X\000U\000D\000F\000\\\000\003\000&\000R\000P\000S\000D\000U\000L\000V\000R\000Q\000\003\000E\000H\000W\000Z\000H\000H\000Q\000\003\000/\000\\000J\000R\000U\000L\000W\000K\000P\000\003\000D\000Q\000G\000\003\000\\000\003\000$\000O\000J\000R\000U\000L\000W\000K\000P\000\003\000\013\000E\000U\000H 000D\000V\000W\000\020 000F\000D\000Q\000F\000H\000U\000\020\000Z\000L\000Q\000V\000F\000R\000Q\000V\000L\000Q\000\014 000\023 000\024\000\023 000\025\000\023 000\026\000\023 000\027\000\023 000\030\000\023 000\031\000\023 000\032\000\023 000\033\000\023 000\034\000\023 000\024\000\023\000\023 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\024\000\030\000\025\000\023\000\025\000\030\000\026\000\023\000\026\000\030\000\027\000\023\000\027\000\030\000\030\000\023\000\030\000\030\000\031\000\023\000\031\000\030\000\032\000\023\000\032\000\030\000\033\000\023\000\033\000\030\000\034\000\023\000\034\000\030\000\024\000\023\000\023 000'\000H\000W\000H\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\0005\000D\000W\000H\000\013\000\010\000\014 000'\000H\000W\000H\000F\000W\000L\000R\000Q\000\003\0003\000U\000H\000F\000L\000V\000L\000R\000Q\000\013\000\010\000\014 000/\000\\0003\000\013\000P\000L\000Q\000B\000V\000X\000S\000 \000\025\000\030\000\010\000\014 000\\000\013\000P\000L\000Q\000B\000V\000X\000S\000 \000\025\000\030\000\010\000\014

First we describe the core algorithm summarize the FPOF measure and the FP algorithm for outlier detection, and then we analyze the drawbacks of FP method. We find that FP method has duplicate computing problem so that it couldnot detect outliers precisely Targeting at this drawback, we propose an improved method LFP method\nd also present its algorithm. LFP method solves the problem above well and it is easy to implement and efficent in time complexity. Finally, we evaluate the two methods by using several datasets and the experiment results show that the LFP method outperforms the FP method. A future work is to solve the parameter sensitivity problem of LFP method, figure out how to fix the most proper min_sup for LFP method A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is funded by the Youth Foundation of the Jina n University under Grant No.51208030 R EFERENCES  1  Jiawei Han, and Micheline Kamber, “Date mining: concepts and techniques,” 2001, pp. 3-5 2  D.

Stating Common users as audience will reach wider segment of users.  Users are also more interested in projects that are in reasonable level of maturity so they will select OSS Project which is already in 5 – Production / Stable development status.  The selected Operating System in Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good influence for another users to download and try the OSS The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or European language translation is important since many of OSS Projects are originated from this region \(Englishspeaking countries or other European language-speaking countries\. It is also interesting to note that some freedom is still available for project initiator to decide i.e. topic programming language and description of his/her project without affecting the number of download Some caution should be considered relating to these rules The subject being researched is small to medium OSS Projects 


 from sourceforge.net that may not reflect the whole population of OSS Projects that are small, medium and large scale.  These result should also verified using OSS Project data from other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code, etc. to verify their validity VI  C ONCLUSION  We present the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule of 134,549 OSS Projects crawled from sourceforge.net portal This covers about 84% of the total of 160,141 OSS Projects registered at the portal in the month of January 2010.  There are more than 27 parameter being recorded into MySQL database i.e. audience, audience count, database environment database environment count, developer count, development status, development status count, number of download filename and file size, license, license count, operating system, operating system count, programming language programming language count, review count, topic, topic count, translation, translation count, user interface, and user interface count The result of this datamining process are 6 success factors that may be applied by project initiators and developers in order to increase the probability of success of their projects The details of the guidelines is shown in Section V.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
