Abstract on the traf\336c map has high traf\336c volume then Section  then Section I I NTRODUCTION Currently available vast amount of traf\336c data are recorded using various components of the intelligent transportation system\(ITS Satellite-based automatic v ehicle location technologies such as Global Positioning System GPS or cellular phones can determine vehicle positions at frequent time intervals These equipments collect information about the vehicle positions and speeds which are archived in large amount of databases enabling further analysis of the data about the traf\336c situations such as traf\336c volume patterns Searching for the pattern is a process for obtaining associations where the occurrence of one event is related to other events The association rule mining method i.e one of the most popular data mining methods with a wide range of applications is used in the proposed mechanism aiming at discovering association relations or correlations among attributes encoded within a database For example 322If Section also has high traf\336c volume 10 time units later.\323 In order to extract these sequential association patterns in the time-related databases and represent at what time the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University Email zhy836@toki.waseda.jp mabu@aoni.waseda.jp sennou@asagi.waseda.jp k.shimada@aoni.waseda.jp hirasawa@waseda.jp event will happen or how long the event will persist we have already proposed a method of time-related association rule mining using Genetic Netw ork Programming GNP to improve the ef\336ciency and effectiveness of the rule extraction in time related databases But in this paper we generalized the original time-related association rule mining in terms of Multi-Branch and Full-Pathes\(MBFP where there are a good number of branches in the judgement nodes and every possible combination of the Multiple branches are studied simultaneously The most famous model in the association rule mining is Apriori algorithm in which Agrawal et al proposed the support-con\336dence framework Ho we v er  Apriori algorithm may suffer from large computational complexity when extracting rules from dense databases Many approaches have been proposed to extract association information in various directions including ef\336cient apriori-like mining methods  6 Genetic Algorithm\(GA  proposed by J.H Holland has also been applied to data mining research in order to deal with dense databases However because a rule is represented as an individual or part of an individual of GA it is hard for them to give us a complete picture of the underlying relationships in problem domains thus it is not easy to extract enough number of association rules Unlike other methods mentioned above the main task of GNP-based data mining is to allow the GNP individuals to self-evolve and extract association rules as many as possible What\325s more it uses evolved individuals\(directed graphs of GNP just as a tool to extract candidate association rules Thus the structure of GNP individuals does not necessarily represent the association relations of the database As a result the structures of GNP individuals are less restricted than the structures of GA and GNP-based data mining becomes capable of producing a large number of association rules The basic feature of the proposed mechanism is like the following The GNP structure of rule representation is generalized to multiple branches and Multi-Branches and FullPaths\(MBFP with Transition Route Memory\(TRM searching mechanisms are used to 336nd all the potential combinations of the attributes using GNP which can improve the ef\336ciency of the proposed method The database is time-related considering the real-time factor Thus the process of searching the data for calculating the con\336dence support and chi-squared value 978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE S D S t D Generalized Rule Extraction and

kind of sequence pattern mining for sequential databases In this paper a method of Generalized Association Rule Mining using Genetic Network Programming GNP with MBFP\(Multi-Branch and Full-Pathes processing mechanism has been introduced in order to 336nd time related sequential rules more ef\336ciently GNP represents solutions as directed graph structures thus has compact structure and partially observable Markov decision process GNP has been applied to generate time related candidate association rules as a tool using the database consisting of a large number of time related attributes The aim of this algorithm is to better handle association rule extraction from the databases in a variety of time-related applications especially in the traf\336c volume prediction and its usage The generalized algorithm which can 336nd the important time related association rules has been proposed and experimental results are presented considering how to use the rules to predict the future traf\336c volume and also how to use the traf\336c prediction in the optimal search problem 200 200 also has high traf\336c volume.\323 is a typical relationship that we will obtain using the normal data mining methods however in dynamic systems with sequential datasets we are more interested in the sequential association patterns such as 322If Section on the traf\336c map has high

corresponds to Simple memory structure to record the passed sub time transitions and their corresponding counts can solve the problem however at the expense of huge overlap checking during the searching Therefore a counting structure of Time Transition tree\(TT tree is proposed which indicates all the possible time transitions starting from one processing node as a tree structure\(Fig.3 The same node in Generalized GNP structure now becomes located in different time transitions hence the counts can be recorded correctly without remembering the history of the passing routes Traveling through the tree to any of the nodes will automatically give the information of the passed routes and also the counts for different time transitions can be stored separately TT tree is just a temporary searching structure for rule extraction and after all the counts are recorded and importance criteria are evaluated it can be destroyed immediately Individuals are encoded using GNP

Overall Low Middle High OD  V CONCLUSION In this paper a generalized sequential association rule mining has been proposed using Generalized GNP with MBFP processing mechanism It is clari\336ed from simulations that the proposed method can extract important time-related association rules for each class of the consequent attributes ef\336ciently These rules are used to decide to which class the time-related data belong From simulations we have also found that the proposed method can be used in traf\336c prediction problems And the obtained rules can provide useful information for the Q-value based optimal route calculation thus 336nally improve the effectiveness of the optimal route algorithm for the navigation system Further improvements on how to combine the traf\336c volume prediction and optimal route algorithm more ef\336ciently will be studied in the next step R EFERENCES  I Kaysi M Ben-Aki v a and H K outsopoulos An Inte grated Approach to Vehicle Routing and Congestion Predictions for Real-time Driver 85 01 65 76 88 44 84 01 82 26 64 98 85 31 80 81 81 72 60 19 82 26 71 83 80 97 59 70 82 01 70 41 80 67 58 02 73 92 73 68 76 04 54 75 83 39 67 93 61 215 155 0.90 0.85 0.80 0.75 0.70 Fig 9 Comparison of the routes with or without prediction TABLE IV A VERAGE T RAVELING TIME OF OPTIMAL R OUTE  TIME UNIT  R out ef orO D pai r 2 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 2 wi t houtpredi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 3 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 3 wi t houtpredi ct i on O 1 O 2 O 3 D 1 D 2 D 3 Or,Dr O ri gin Dest i nat i on ofrout e r i i t i i t t 002 002 j j j j  Q d 6 0 5 i 002 b 212 b N f t t E Optimal Route with Traf\336c Prediction A Q i t V ij V ij V ij t Q Q Q   1 If 2 If 1 and 2 are the parameters for the reward and punishment by future traf\336c prediction respectively and 1  2   to intersection Middle Middle     Prediction Accuracy 0.95 1 51 19 187 13 114 26 Q d Q d N S W E  Low Low Low R out ef orO D pai r 1 wi t h predi ct i on R out ef orO D pai r 1 wi t houtpredi ct i on 002 High High High j                                    W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7  respectively TABLE III A VERAGE P REDICTION A CCURACY FOR DIFFERENT SELF DECREASE RATE T ESTING      where  without prediction Improved Rate   2 3     1  1  Q d is 323Low\323 and the real traf\336c of this section at time is exactly 323Low\323 then the accuracy is 100 The values based on the current traf\336c Three OD pair accuracy means the accuracy when the real traf\336c is values by traf\336c prediction and using 002 002 current criteria the thresholds for evaluating the importance of the rules are decreased based on the self-decrease rate in order to extract enough number of rules for each class How to choose the proper self-decrease rate is very important since it in\337uences the testing accuracy as shown in Table III The accuracy is de\336ned in the following if the traf\336c prediction result of the section at time self-decrease rate It can be seen from Table III that the more the criteria for important association rules decreases the lower the prediction accuracies become The next step is to use the prediction for the optimal route calculation in order to obtain better routes For example if the navigation system knows section in the route will have a high traf\336c volume during the traveling the navigation system can chose another optimal route to avoid being trapped in the heavy traf\336c values at the intersections of the current route are revised as follows when the car arrive at the intersection at time 1 represents the traf\336c volume prediction from intersection at time 5 are used In order to study the ef\336ciency of the traf\336c volume prediction the greedy method is applied to the vehicle after the above update of values which means the vehicle will choose the route with the minimum Q-value Comparison is done between using updated s are considered for calculating the routes with or without prediction which are shown in Fig.9 As shown in the Table IV Q-value based optimal route calculation with traf\336c prediction can reduce the traveling time of the optimal route since it considers the future traf\336c situations when choosing the next section on the optimal route with prediction
