Association of Signal-Controlled Meth od at Roundabout and Stop Rate  Yu Bai, Kun Xue  Yu Bai Department of Road and Traffic Engineering Tongji University Shanghai,China Kun Xue  Department of Road and Traffic Engineering Tongji University Shanghai,China   Abstract Since the fact that the non-signal roundabout allows less flow rate, and with the increasing of roundabout flow rate series of problems have occurred in respect of traffic jam rising of accident rate, growth of traffic delay and increasing of 
saturation degree, etc. Arrangement of signal control help to enhance the efficiency at roundabout and security, but there exist big difference for applicable conditions and traffic efficiencies under different sign al control methods. The main concern of this text, on the foundation of Left-turn with Two stop Control Method at Roundabout, with consideration of the number of different entrance paths and on the basis of signal control theory and optimal method, is on the three control methods related with “Control of In-turn Discharge Clockwise at Signal-entrance Path”, “C ontrol of In-turn Discharge Clockwise at Signal-entrance Pa th + Interlace of Minor Flow and “Association Roundabout 
Control at Multi--entrance Path”. It is on such a basis that the methods analyzing the effect rule on stop rate coming from the signal cycle and space strategy parameters and radius of island under different signal control methods by applying approaches of numerical calculation and experimental traffic engineering. The research achievement will perfect the theory system for signal control roundabout and provide technical support for the reconstruction of uncontrolled roundabout as well as selection of signal control method of roundabout, meaning significant application value Keywords- Signal-Controlle d Roundabout \(SCR\alControlled Method, Stop Rate, Adaptability I 
  I NTRODUCTION  Uncontrolled roundabout features in less conflict points non-necessity of stopping and simpler way of management The increasing demand for roundabout traffic have brought forth series problems at Uncontrolled roundabout in respect of traffic jam, rising of accident rate, growth of vehicle delay and increasing of saturation. Signalizing at roundabout has greatly improved the traffic capability of roundabouts while differences exist between condition of adaptability and traffic efficiency under different signal controlling methods In addition to difference between traffic capacity and real 
time vehicle delay, there is bigger difference for stop rate especially for stop rate of left-turn traffic flow. Stop rate affects the vehicle's fuel consumption and automotive emission. Less stop rates as possible will effectively reduce environment pollution. Hence, it is necessary to make a study on the adaptability for various methods when searching for the optimization method to effectively lower the stop rate II  R ESEARCH REVIEW  It is divided into two directions of unsigned-controlled roundabout and controlled roundabout in the related 
domestic research. For the research of unsignal-controlled roundabout, it mainly involves the study of traffic characteristics and its applicable conditions, capacity, delay safety and geometrical design, etc. in which, for most cases the capacity and delay of roundabout entrance under different conditions of entrance and loop is calculated by using gap-acceptance model 1 2   3  4  For foreign researchers they tend to connect safety with geometrical design of roundabout which is made under guidance of safety requirements for vehicle and pedestrians 5   In the countries of the States, Australia and Britain, numbers of 
national regulations have been issued concerning roundabout design, which have laid a foundation for the study of space related optimal design of signal-controlled roundabout and evaluation of traffic efficiency The study on signal-controlled roundabout started at a later time and according to designing guidance for roundabout in the States and Australia, it qualitatively regulates that signal control could be implemented for certain entrances if necessary, stressing that it should be used with great care and should not be used for purpose of a long-term solution to traffic jam. Baranowski 8 made a study on the signal control method for roundabout 
pedestrians, exploring condition and safety of arranging signal for roundabout pedestrians. Akçelik made a study on the limit control of capacity at entrance of roundabout 9 We study the relevant research in our country in 1998, which was initially raised by researchers from engineering department of Tongji University 10 1 1  They established basic principle and approach for left-turn with two-stop control at roundabout and gave it a good study in the way of traffic law, signal timing method, applicable condition optimization control method and efficiency evaluation.

Ao Guchang 1 put forward signal control method for roundabout under condition without of straight flow Researches from home and abroad focus on the field of non-signal controlled roundabout, with less time in the study of signal-controlled roundabout. It needs further research in terms of capacity of signal-controlled roundabout, condition of geometric topology, demand for mixed traffic flow and adaptability of signal control at roundabout III  I NTRODUCTION TO SIGNAL CONTROL METHOD AT ROUNDABOUT  A  Control of in-turn discharge clockwise at signalentrance path In this control method, each entrance lane discharge Inturn of clockwise, see Fig. 1 This control method could be converted into a one-way closed intersection group \(Fig. 2\To take the five-fork intersection as a example, it could be regarded as an intersection group made of five intersections of A, B, C, D and E. To select datum point of coordination control, to set the Max delay as optimization target and to choose signal period, phase difference and queuing length as constraint condition, the optimization of other parameters will be carried out B  Control of in-turn discharge clockwise at signalentrance path + interlace of minor flow With consideration of order and efficiency of multi-fork roundabout, on the basis of Control of In-turn Discharge Clockwise at Signal-entrance Path, the interlace of secondary traffic flow is introduced \(Fig. 3\treat a main flow and several secondary flows which have least conflicts between each other as the same phase C  Association roundabout control at multi--entrance path Three phases are usually designed for three-fork roundabout and twice is released within one period at each entrance \(Fig. 4\. Two phases are usually designed for fourfork roundabout \(Fig. 5\Twice is released within one period at each entrance of five-fork roundabout, and release is made clockwise at entrance lane \(Fig. 6\. Three phases are arranged at for six-fork roundabout and release is made clockwise at entrance lane \(Fig. 7 Associated Roundabout Control at Multi-entrance Path includes, in two ways, the coordination of entrance signal and loop signal, and then the coordination with loop signal The optimization model of timing parameters is established under concept of equisaturation, but the space constraint of loop parking should be realized. When flow ratio between different entrance lanes in the same phase is unbalanced, or queuing vehicles inside the loop go beyond conflict point \(or stop line\which influences the normal traffics, it is suggested to take coordination measures of delayed start-up early disconnection or start-up and late disconnection for green signals of conflict flows IV  C ALCULATION METHOD FOR STOP RATE OF SCR When discharging method is adopted in sequent clockwise order at one-way entrance in terms of roundabout stop rate will be influenced by the control of the first stop line at entrance lane while it will be mutually influenced by the control of both the first stop line at entrance lane and the second stop line on circular road when the cooperative discharging method is adopted at multi way entrance A  Stop rate for the first stop line of entrance lane Similar with ordinary intersections, the motion state for vehicles at the first stop line of entrance lane of signalcontrolled circular road usually applies the calculation method for intersection stop rate 000>\000\024\000\027\000 The stop rate a f of the first stop line at SCR entrance lane is decided by the sum of stop rate between “random and over-saturation stop rate  0 f  and “normal block u f i.e   0 u t a f f f 000\016 000 000D    000 000 000 000 000 000d 000 000\020 000\020 000\020 000\020 000\020 000 000 0 0 0 2 0 0 0    12  1   1   4 x x x x T Q x x x x sg ST sg Q f t   000 000 000 000 000 000t 000\037 000\020 000\020 000 1 0  1 1 1 1 x x y f u 000O  In which 001 t is the correction factor set after complete consideration of a full stop Q 0  is the average number of stranded queuing vehicles at entrance lane by the end of signal circulation under saturation \(pcu Q t  is the traffic capacity at direction of such entrance \(pcu /s s is the saturated discharge value of vehicles \(pcu x is the saturation of entrance lane T is the time interval of research for average delayed queuing vehicles\(s x 0 is the saturation threshold at entrance lane g is the effective green time\(s 002\034  is the green ratio y is the flow ratio B  Stop rate for the second stop line of roundabou  1  State analysis for left-turn vehicles at the second stop line In accordance with the relationship of driving time t h  that the left-turn front vehicle goes from the first stop line to the second stop line and the effective green time g eL a for left-turn at the first stop line, the motion state of left-turn vehicles could be divided into the following three \(See Fig 8 000x  The light turns green for the second stop line when the left-turn front vehicles arrive at the second stop line, i.e 2 I g t a eL h 000\016 000 The left-turn flow does not stop at the second stop line, encountering no jams and the stop rate is 0 000x  The light simultaneously turns green for the second stop line when the left-turn front vehicles arrive at the second stop line, i.e 2 I g t a eL h 000\016 000 The left-turn flow does not stop at the second stop line encountering no jams and the stop rate is 0

This text mainly analyzes the relevance between central island radius, signal cycle and stop rate To indicate the influence under such control mode coming from the central island radius and signal cycle certain parameters are supposed to be at definite values From the point of physical meaning of parameters, we presume that the roundabout belongs to the type of orthogonal crossing and the number of entrance lanes, the number of roundabout lanes and the number of exist lanes match. The saturation flow for straight forward lanes of entrances is 1650 pcu/h and saturation flow for left-turn lanes is 1550 pcu/h, which are symmetrically matching  A  Analysis on stop rate for control method of synergistic discharge at multi entrance lane  1  Relevance between stop rate and signal cycle On the basis of above calculation method via using VISSIM simulation results for model modification, we obtain variety laws of stop rate for straight forward and average left-turn vehicles with the changes of signal cycle under the control method for synergistic discharging at multi entrance lane of roundabout.

method via using VISSIM simulation results for model modification, we obtain variety laws of stop rate for average vehicles with the changes of central island radius under the control method for synergistic discharging at multi entrance lane of roundabout. From Fig.11, it could be found that  000x  The stop rate of average straight forward vehicles varies little with the changes of central island radius under the synergistic control of discharging at multi entrance lane of roundabout, generally around 0.6~0.7 time/pcu 000x  The stop rate for average left-turn vehicles slightly increases at the beginning with the radius growth of central island while it decreases when the radius of central island grows at certain value. The smaller the cycle is, the more obvious the downtrend will be B  Analysis on stop rate for control method of orderly discharge clockwise at single entrance lane For roundabout in the control mode of orderly discharge clockwise at single entrance lane, stop rate is mainly reflected at the fist stop line while the stop rate of the first sop line is not influenced by the radius of central island of roundabout, which is only influenced by the traffic control parameters, e.g. signal cycle, etc. By adopting the calculation mode for the stop rate at the first stop line of entrance lane and by using VISSIM simulation results for model modification, we obtain variety laws for the stop rate of average vehicle with changes of signal cycle when it is controlled by the discharging control of single entrance lane at roundabout, refer to Fig. 12 It could be found that the total stop rate of average vehicle at intersections \(ratio for left-turn and straight forward is 1:2\ will slightly increase with the growth of signal cycle, usually around 0.7~0.8 VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Arrangement of signal control at roundabout can greatly help to increase the traffic capacity and safety and there lies difference for applicable conditions and traffic efficiency under different methods. This research puts forward three control methods concerning auto vehicles at signalcontrolled crossings, establishes stop rate models for the first stop line at entrance lane of signal-controlled crossings and the second stop line of roundabout and analyzes the influence laws on the stop rate of signal-controlled crossings caused by the signal cycle of time & space parameters and radius of central island under the two different modes of method of synergistic roundabout control discharged at multi entrance lanes and control method of orderly discharge clockwise at single entrance lane Researches show that the signal cycle under two control methods is less influential on stop rate. With precondition of the same signal cycle, the stop rate for control method of orderly discharge clockwise at single entrance lane is 0.7~0.8 the stop rate for straight forward vehicles synergistically discharging at multi entrance lane is 0.6~0.7, stop rate for left-turn vehicles is 1.3~1.5. Hence, when the straight forward vehicle ratio at roundabout is more than 85%, the stop rate will be smaller for control method of synergistically discharging vehicles at multi entrance lane. Meanwhile under certain signal cycle conditions, the bigger the radius of central island, the smaller the totally average stop rate at intersections will be. The research result has provided us with quantitative basis in theory when choosing signal control method of roundabout  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Project No.50708080\the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education \(SRFDP R EFERENCES  1  X.Yang, X.

Stating Common users as audience will reach wider segment of users.  Users are also more interested in projects that are in reasonable level of maturity so they will select OSS Project which is already in 5 – Production / Stable development status.  The selected Operating System in Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good influence for another users to download and try the OSS The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or European language translation is important since many of OSS Projects are originated from this region \(Englishspeaking countries or other European language-speaking countries\. It is also interesting to note that some freedom is still available for project initiator to decide i.e. topic programming language and description of his/her project without affecting the number of download Some caution should be considered relating to these rules The subject being researched is small to medium OSS Projects 


 from sourceforge.net that may not reflect the whole population of OSS Projects that are small, medium and large scale.  These result should also verified using OSS Project data from other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code, etc. to verify their validity VI  C ONCLUSION  We present the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule of 134,549 OSS Projects crawled from sourceforge.net portal This covers about 84% of the total of 160,141 OSS Projects registered at the portal in the month of January 2010.  There are more than 27 parameter being recorded into MySQL database i.e. audience, audience count, database environment database environment count, developer count, development status, development status count, number of download filename and file size, license, license count, operating system, operating system count, programming language programming language count, review count, topic, topic count, translation, translation count, user interface, and user interface count The result of this datamining process are 6 success factors that may be applied by project initiators and developers in order to increase the probability of success of their projects The details of the guidelines is shown in Section V. Future work of this research include expanding the experiment to cover other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code and freshmeat.net ACKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank Maranatha Christian University \(http://www.maranatha.edu\ that provides the funding for this research and Department of Computer Science and Electronics at Gadjah Mada University http://mkom.ugm.ac.id\ which provides guideline and technical assistance for the research R EFERENCES  1  R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
