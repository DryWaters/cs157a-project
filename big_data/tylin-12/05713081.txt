INTRODUCTION 
Recent studies and extensive data indicate that the system failure occurs mostly due to software defects. With software working, system resources gradual exhaust or run errors gradual accumulate, they both cause system performance continues to decline and even hang down. This phenomenon is known as software aging[1  T he  r e a s on w hy it happens is that in the long-term continuous operation software exists the occupation and leak in system memory not released file lock, the data is not updated in time, storage space debrisa and the accumulation of r ounding errors etc.[1   T h i s  phe nom e non s e r i ous l y t h r e a t s t h e s o f t w a r e  
reliability, es pecially if the s erver which f aces extensive visits and large amount of data was down caused by aging it wouldnêt respond to user requests and make significant losses. In order to resolve this problem, software rejuvenation is introduced. This kind of "software restore technology is formally proposed in [2 by Y   H u a ng w ho come from AT&T Bell Laboratory. Software rejuvenation is a preventive measure designed to prevent accidental failure Simply, it terminates the running of program when the performance of software declines to a certain degree, restarts the system to clean up its internal state \(such as collect 
garbage, update the operating system kernel tables, reinitialize  the internal data structure, etc .\  and release of  the operating system resources, so that performance of software could be restored[2  T h e k e y of s o f t w a r e r e j uve na t i on technique is to find the optimal rejuvenation time by the prediction of software aging trend. According to previous researches, we can group the prediction of software aging trend into two basic ideas. One is time-based[2  t h at i s t o  establish mathematical model based on state of software system, and then to predict by mathematical method S.Garg etc. [3 pr opos e a m o s t pe r f e c t c o m p r e he ns i v e  m ode l  a bout  
time-based. Another is measurement-based[4   t h at  i s  t o  predict by main parameters which are monitored during actual running process In [4  S  G a r g pr opos e s t h e k e y parameter is memory us age which is likely to lead to s oftware aging. In addition, K. Vaidyanathathan etc. [5 t a k e t h e  system load into account, they think the rate of resources consumption as not only the function of time but also load It can be seen through the above description, timebased approach is easy to accomplish, but it does not measure the current state of the software, therefore it applies only to the system which has small changes in visiting and 
loading. The measurement-based method monitors the condition of running system to predict but in unknow circumstance such as sudden large scale concurrent because of unexpected factors, it is difficult to predict based on current data. Therefore, this paper proposes a new software aging trend prediction method which is based on user intention. The reason why system aging is that various components effect each com ponent generates a little aging damage after it is requested once, according to the predicted result of  user intention, all the damages are accumulated to get the amount of damage of whole system. In this paper 
firstly, use the method of multiple linear regression to compute the aging damage coming from various components which are requested once and then predict the users access amount in "next moment",finally accumulate them to predict the software aging trend 2. EXTRACT THE AGING DAMAGE OF COMPONENTS Software aging is an process that error continuously accumulates, it usually shows thr ough the loss of system ___________________________________ 978-1-42448886-5 10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE  


resources, however, it does not immediately cause system failure, instead of gradual deterioration even failure Therefore, through the asymptotic loss of system resources it can judge if the software exists aging problem or not. The use of system resources includes two parts: the normal running and the software aging damage. The normal running part is varied with system load, while the damage part appears an obvious upward or downward trend. Figure 1 shows a collection of system available memory data, it is observed that the available memory is random and rapid changing, that is because the load is gradually changed during system operation, but among the entire process, it appears an obvious downward trend, which is caused by the software aging damage. To analyze the process of software aging, firstly need to extract the software aging damage part from the normal running part[6   Fig. 1 system available memory The next step is to calculate the amount of damage after each com ponent is requested once according to the overall damage. The whole system aging is the result of various components combined effect, this process could be seen as multiple independent variables affect a dependent variable s o we can s olve this problem by multivariate linear regression analysis method[7  T a k e t h e da m a ge of  t h e  whole system as dependent various and the damage after each com ponent is requested once as independent various Comput the influence factors\(the coefficient of independent various\ according to the history records, then to predic. In addition, physical memory leak is an important factor leading to software aging, this paper takes memory as research object. For illus tration, make the following d efinition y 1 t 1 y 2 t 2 y 3 t 3 y n t n as the consumption of memory during interval time \(t i t i-1  i=1,2,É,n  Definition 2 Set \(S 1 S 2  S k as the components deployed in the server, \(x 1 x 2 x k as the amount of each component is called, in the k+1 dimensional sequence  0  1  2  k when k = 1,2, ..., k, it is the consumption of each com ponent is called once, when k 0 , it is the basic consumption of memory during the server running Definition 3 Set 1  2  n as the random error, and  N\(0  2  Take the n group of observed value \(y i x i1 x i2 x ik 1 2Én,as the equation set 10111212 1 1 20121222 2 2 01122 kk kk nnnknkn yxx x yxx x yxx x                                1   k 1 x k  2  k 2 x k  nk k  k x k Where y i i=1,2 n\ is the consumption of memory resources in some time, it is measurable, x ij i=1,2 n  j=1,2 k\ is the  amount of each com ponent is requested form i-1 to i period, it is recordable too is the consumption of the memory caused by each com ponent is called once and is the random error, the two values are waiting tested The above equation can be written in matrix form in formula 1 Y=X  1 Where 11 12 1 21 22 2 12 1 1 1 k k nn nk xx x xx x X xx x 012 015 015  015 015   1 k x 1 015 1 k   1 k 015 x 015 2 k x 015 015 x 015 015 015 015 015  nk x 015 015 Y=\(y 1 y 2 y n  T   1  2  n  T  0  1  2  k  T  We can get by OLS. The solution of formular 1 is  1   XX XY    2 When y i  0  1 x i1  2 x i2  k x ik  i define residual error e i as the estimation of random error  the form of e i defined in formular 3\, so the estimation of 2 is SSE, it is defined in formular 4 011 22 ii i i kik ey x x x          kik x ki  3 Q e e 1 2 e 2 2 e n 2 4 3. THE ACCUMULATION OF SYSTEM AGING DAMAGE In order to predict the consumption of system memory caused by aging while the call number of components are 12    k xxx x     12 x   12  k   it uses of the formula 5 01122 kk yxx x          122 12    x x 1 22 kk kk k kk    k x kk  5 in formula 5 and  are the estimated value in section 2, s o now, the key is to seek for the number of call for various components in "next time" , it is 12    k xxx x     12 x   12  k   The services usually exsit in the form of components in web site, there are various relationships information between components and components, and they are closely contacted with user access pattern. When a user visits a web site, it records the access log, the accumulated access logs are the best object of data mining[8   B y  m i ni ng t h e s e logs, user access patterns can be f ound. For example Association Rule Mining can get related information between components through history use access, make use of the information to predict the future situation of the user access real-time 


3.1Basic Concepts In order to analyze the association rule between components, the formal definition is following Definition 4 \(Component Set\ All of the components appearing in the web site are expressed as p=\(p 1 p 2 p k  the web pages which execute same function form a component Definition 5 \(Item Sets\ A series of components which are visited by someone user are called the item set u i u i p Define the number of items as the size of item sets Definition 6 The support S\(p i f p i p is the frequency of components appear.The support S\(p i p j f p i p j is the frequency of components combination appear Definition 7 The confidence of rules p i p j is  Sp p p p  Sp ij ij i C    it means the probabilityof access the com ponent p j after p i Definition 8 The importance of rules p i p j is  I\(p p  ln p p   p not p  ij ji j i CC  it means the effectiveness of the rules, if the value is the higher, the rule is more effective 3.2 Mining User Intention by Association Rule First of all, through the user access logs we can get a transaction database, such as Table 1.These data describe a series of components accessed by the users, for instance, T 1 user accesses to the p 1 p 2 and p 5 components. Take these records as historical data, through a large number of them to mine the relation information between components T able 1 user access record user component user component T1 p1 p2 p5 T6 p2 p3 T2 p2 p4 T7 p1 p3 T3 p2 p3 T8 p1 p2 p3 p5 T4 p1 p2 p4 T9 p1 p2 p3 T5 p1 p3 Then, according to the a bove historical data, us e as s ociation rule mining algorithm to get the pos s ibility that  is similar to user access p j after access p i There are two key steps in association rule mining algorithm, the first  is how to generate frequent itemsets, the second is how to generate association rules based on frequent itemsets. Apriori[9 i s  a  classical association rule algorithm, this paper uses it to get the pos ibility of us er accesses p j after p i The basic idea of Apriori algorithm could be found in[10  he r e  i s  not  described in detail Finally,build the confidence matrix C k k fumula6 according to the confidence computed thr ough Apriori algorithm where C ij is the confidence of accessing pj after pi. If it is known that the amount of user request for each components at the current time is  = \(1, 2 k\, the total amount of user request for component pj at the next time is expressed as fumula 7 11 12 1 21 22 2 12 k k kk kk kk CC C CC C C CC C  012 015 015  015 015   1 k C 1 015 1 k   1 k 015 C 015 2 k C 2 015 015 C 015 015 015 015 015 C  k k C k 015 015 C 6 1 k jiij i PC     7 Similarly, the total amount \(P 1 P 2 P j f user request for other components is easy to solve. P=\(P 1 P 2 P j is equal to 12     k xxx x     12 x   12  k    3 3 Accumulating Damag e Model The memory damage of the whole system is the accumulation of all the com ponents damages coming from the process of  requestion. It is  known the damage while each com ponent is called once and the amount of ca lling at the next time, it could  predict the remain of system memory at the next time. The accumulating damage model can be expressed in the form of formula 5  0  1  2  k and  are estimated in section 2 12     k xxx x     12 x   12  k   is estimated in section 3 4. EXPERIMENT The research is accomplished under the operation of Microsoft Windows XP configurate a Tomcat server which is saved 5 components, these components are compiled in JAVA. In order to simulate the phenomenon of software aging caused by memory leak the basic function of these components is to create an object which occupies a certain amount of memory as well as doesn  t release before restarting the server. In this way, when each com ponent is called, it produces a certain degree of memory leaks By using pressure measurement tool provided by Loadrunner virtual users are created to ask for these components, as described in Table 2, the result is demonstrated in figure 2 The purple line is the actual running result of the system,the green line is the result of software aging trend prediction based on user intention and the red line is the result of measurement-based. From this picture, it can be seen that when the change of access am ount is not significant,the two prediction methods both are near to the real value. However,when the change of access am ount is dramatical, it is similar to the moment of 10 minutes, the measurement-based method can  t adapt to change of access amount, it predicts the software aging trend according to the outdated state. Similarly ,when the moment of 14 minutes 


the access am ount is dramatically increasing from 0 to 220 the measurement-based method makes an inaccurate prediction too. On the contrary, whether the change of access am ount is significant or not, the method based on user intention could accurately predic the software aging trend. So ,it can be concluded that, compared with the measurement method, this method has highter accuracy in dealing with sudden large scale concurrent questions Table 2 request dat a Fig. 2  prediction result 5. SUMMARY Software aging of the system is due to the call and transformation of various components each com ponent w ill generate a certain of damage after calling, the more the amount of visiting, the greater the degree of aging. This paper calculats the damage of each com ponent is requested once according to the history record by multiple linear regression, and then predict the amount of visiting for the next time by association rule mining, finally, accumulate the amount of damage from concurrent request to get the total amount of damage of entire system during certain period Using it to predic the software aging trend. The experiment illus trats that this met hod of considering the system loading is more precise than measurement-based method in solving the large concurrent problem 6.

preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
