the knowledgeable heterogeneity of geodatabases due to lack of semantic association, achieving information share and interoperation of the GIS data. It will greatly reduce the workload of building a Geo-ontology by building Geo-ontology automatically based-on geodatabase, and the sticking point is defined the mapping rules from geodatabase to Geo-ontology in this process. Firstly, this article researches the mapping rules from the relational database to ontology, compares and 
analyzes the difference of mapping methods; and then drawn the semantic mapping rules from geodatabase to Geo-ontology; finally, builds the Geo-ontology  Keywords Geodatabase;Geo-ontology;Semantic sociation Mapping I  INTRODUCTION With the development of GIS, GIS data grows rapidly. In order to achieve the full utilization of the information, how 
to share and interoperate data becomes a serious problem The mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology could provide context-sensitive semantics for different geographic data, and thus the interoperability in heterogeneous geographic data become truly  Recently, the ontology becomes more concerned and the research of Geo-ontology graphical has many results. It’s mainly concentrated on geographic information integration 
discovery and retrieval, etc. However, the study of building Geo-ontology is still in the phase of hand-building, auxiliary building. To achieve the automatic construction of Geo-ontology, this article starts at the difficulty of building Geo-ontology – studies the mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology, makes mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology which adapted to the geographical area 
based on the analysis and comparison of mapping method from a relational data model to the ontology, and takes spatial database of river basin as an example to illuminate the construction of Geo-ontology  II  THE RESEARCH OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC As the important role that Geo-ontology plays was recognized, foreign and domestic research institutions and scholars started to pay attention ontology research, and there 
are lots of results in the data model and ontology mapping research.

c  Users manually build a relational database model and simple inter-ontology mappings, and expressed in the form RD Map in the end 2\ Onto Grate [3 w a s dev e l o p e d at th e Un iv ers i ty Oreg on  United States in 2006, which was a relational database model and inter-ontology mapping system. It consists of six mainly functional modules: syntax converter, map generation module, reasoning module, learning module excavation module, the user interface module. Its implementation process as following: At first use the syntax converter and convert relational database models and ontology to the middle of the model which uses Web-PDDL language to describe respectively, and then complemented by human involvement, built the mapping between the two intermediate models by mapping generation module  B.  Domestic 1\ MASON [5 w a s de v e l o pe d as a c o m m on  inter-relational database models and ontology mapping tool in Southeast University, 2006. It is to use pre-defined transformation rules firstly, convert the relational database schema and the ontology to the intermediate model, then take in the string compare-based mapping algorithm and the structure-based of SF algorithms, at last search between the simple corresponding in the elements and output  2\ Zhuo-Ming Xu [6 ve n  a s e m a nt i c s-p r e s er vi ng w a y from the ER model to OWL DL ontology. This method limits single inheritance between the entities based on the formalized representation of ER model, and establishes the corresponding concept between ER model and OWL DL ontology. It achieves mode conversion by an algorithm which in accordance with a predefined set of mapping rules and develops ER2WO C.  Analysis and Comparison From the above research situation between foreign and domestic, generally the mapping between relational database schema and ontology can be divided as follows  1\ Directly extract the ontology from the relational database. Its advantages and disadvantages: Directly extracted ontology from a relational database, had a high degree of automation, the transformation between the data model and ontology can be achieved by just make a database mapping rules. The relationship between the data model which implicit in the entities can be able to demonstrate clearly, and the database data change into ontology instances. However, as the database schema and the ontology structure is not completely consistent, direct extraction ontology is not necessarily able to obtain the required one. It’s mainly applicable to the automatic ontology building in a small amount of data  2\onvert through intermediate models between relational databases and ontology. Its advantages and disadvantages: The conversion method that through intermediate model between relational databases and ontology, which can truly achieve the semantic representations between the database schema and the ontology. However, it is more complex and less automated and requires a pre-given correlation exists between the ontology and database. It’s mainly applied to the area to switch between different data models  III   GEO-ONTOLOGY AND GEODATABASE A.  Geo-ontology Ontology is a philosophy, information science concept which is introduced to the geographical area of science Geo-Ontology refers to the geographical areas of knowledge information and data are abstracted into one common nature of an object or entity, and makes a treatment of clear definition and conceptualization, ultimately, gives formal expression of the theory and method   In general, Geo-ontology includes: geographic areas of concepts \(classes\, a concept as well as the geographical characteristics of the relationship between the data instances\ The concepts which exist in Geo-ontology are not isolated between them there is a certain level of relations and semantic relations. Geo-Ontology not only has the general properties of identity, but also has the unique spatial characteristics. In addition to need describe the attribute information, the Geo-ontology also need describe the geographic information in spatial information, as the location relationship, topological relationship, and the relationship between part and whole

B.  Geodatabase Geodatabase refers to a region on the characteristics of a certain geographical elements of data collection. Spatial data are generally stored as vector data, raster data, as well as in the traditional sense of the property sheet. An RDBMS table can be used to store an element of the collection, and each row in the table is to save an element, which the Shape field is, storage space for elements of geometry or shape information. However, Raster and image data are stored in relational tables  IV    BUILDING THE GEO-ONTOLOGY BASED ON THE GEODATABASE Traditionally, the ways of building the ontology mostly rely on handcrafted tools to achieve after analyzing the database structure and table content, it is possible in the case of small amount of data. However, geographic data has a great amount of complex spatial relationships, building corresponding Geo-ontology is an extremely complex time-consuming and labor-intensive process following the traditional method. Building the Geo-ontology should be creating a new approach according to the characteristics and storage of geographical data. Automatic building ontology becomes a new direction for building a Geo-ontology because of greatly reducing the workload in the process Below, we analyze the existence of difficulties on the automatic building process, set down mapping rules between geodatabase and Geo-ontology, and initially achieve the automatic building of Geo-ontology by programmed algorithm according to the rules A    The difficulties of Semantic Association There is a certain link between geodatabase and Geo-ontology. Geodatabase contains multiple data tables which has 1 vs. 1, 1 vs. multiple, multiple vs. multiple relationships. Each data sheet is made up of a number of fields, and records are the field value in the table Geo-ontology contains more than one class, and there is a certain level of relationship among classes; each class has multiple attributes, and instances are the collection of attribute values   Figure1 the relation of the geodatabase and the geo-ontology This provides the basis for mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology. However, geodatabase and Geo-ontology model are not entirely consistent; there are still many difficulties to truly realize the corresponding semantic association despite of a simple mapping. The main difficulties are 1\ How to select Geo-ontology concepts \(classes\ from multiple tables in the geodatabase, and establish the hierarchy of concepts 2\ How to determine the relationship among concepts classes\. It is mainly the spatial relationships between concepts, namely, topology, location relationship 3\ How to obtain instances for building the Geo-ontology from vast amounts of geographic data in the geodatabase B  Establish the Mapping Rules OWL is an ontology language, which is defined and instanced, and it use object-oriented approach to describe the domain knowledge, describe the character and relation of classes and attributes through axioms and constraints According the ability of expression and calculation, OWL can be divided into three seeds Language: OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL Full. OWL DL support users that need the strongest expression in the reasoning system, which can guarantee the integrality and decidability of calculation Considering further study after building the Geo-ontology this paper uses OWL DL as Geo-ontology description language Based on the above understanding, we can use OWL language to describe and express the concepts and their relationships, and establish the mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology

1\ Analysis geospatial data table in geodatabase, study out the table name as the important concepts of the domain, and select the key concept to express the domain knowledge as much as possible. In the concepts, refer the categories of basic geographic information to determine the level of their relationship; finally, the selected concept will be mapped Geo-ontology class or sub-class A data table T 001 owl:Class  rdf:ID= TName Many data tables \(for example, two data tables\ T1, T2 there is "father-son" relationship, T2 is T1 sub-categories 001 owl:Class  rdf:ID="T2Name rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class  rdf:ID="T1Name rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class 2\ In the geodatabase, the attribute information is stored in the data tables in form of field; field is mapped to Geo-ontology’s data type property Field that contains the attribute information F 001\027 owl:DatatypeProperty  rdf:ID="FName 3\ Spatial relations can be mapped to object properties in the geodatabase, and it describes the spatial relations of geographic elements by defining the domain and range of attribute Field that contains the spatial relationship F, geographical factors A1, A2 exist spatial relationships 001 owl:ObjectProperty  rdf:ID="FName rdfs:domain  rdf:resource="A1 002 A2 002   rdfs:range  rdf:resource=" A2 002 A1 002   owl:ObjectProperty In addition, the spatial relations can also describe by the multi-nested structure of OWL ontology. It is able to express clearly the spatial relationships of geographic factors, but there are many difficulties to achieve, especially a large amount of data 4\ In the geodatabase, records are mapped to Geo-ontology instances. Field names are mapped to the name of ontology instance, attribute data are mapped to the DatatypeProperty value of ontology instance; the spatial data are mapped to ObjectProperty value C  Building River Basin Geo-ontology  According to the mapping rules from the geodatabase to Geo-ontology, using water spatial database of river basin as an example, we can build river basin Geo-ontology by the Java programming language and Jena tools. Specific methods: firstly, obtain the geo-ontological structure from water spatial database of river basin based on the mapping rule; and then use the ontology building tools to optimize the structure of Geo-ontology; finally, records which were stored in the database are mapped to instances of Geo-ontology. Therefore, the appropriate river basin Geo-ontology creates  The description is that tables of spatial database of river water correspond to the Geo-ontology class  The description is that fields of water spatial database of river basin correspond to the Geo-ontology properties including spatial relations   The description is that records of water spatial database of river basin correspond to instances of Geo-ontology

At present, there are not yet fully mature in theory and in practice, and we need to further research and development. Based on geodatabase, Geo-ontology theory we analysis the current mapping method from the relational database to ontology, try and put forward the mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology and build the corresponding Geo-ontology by the rules based-on water spatial data of river basin. This is only the first step of solving GIS application in interoperability, more research and work will be done on the semantic reasoning and search of the GIS applications in the future   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The work presented in this paper has been funded by 863 Science Foundation of China \(No. 2007AA12Z215\.

This model identifies statistically significant event associations inherent in a given data set, using residual analysis to test whether or not a pattern candidate is significantly deviated from a default loglinear model. The generated rules annotated with weight of evidence are fired independently to classify the input feature vector In scenarios where labeling requires further statistical augmentation, a deterministic means of confidence could be derived. The confidence measure can be further combined with the label to supplement the decision analogous to multiple votes. The proposed non-fuzzy model leveraging such weighted classifiers increases the accuracy of decisionmaking R EFERENCES  M Hol s heimer and A.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
