In this study, we use Maximum find the travel pattern of browsers from web logs. Simultaneously experts are asked to evaluate the fuzzy importance weightings for different webs. At last, we employ fuzzy data mining technique that combines Apriori algorithm with fuzzy weights to determine the association rules From the yielded association rules, one can be accurately aware of the information consumers need ey prefer. This is important to governmental institutions and enterprises. Enterprises can find the commercial opportunities and improve the design of webs by means of this study. Governmental institutions can realize the needs of people from the obtained association rules, make the promotion of policy more efficiently, and provide better service quality Keywords Data Mining, Maximum Forward Reference, Fuzzy set theory 1. Introduction It is difficult to design a website that meets the need of consumers\220 browsing habits. There are some problems existing in the present webs, for example, the contents, frame and browsing path of webs are all decided according to the designers\220 willing not the browsing habits of most uses. In this study, we use the records of browsing to further understand the interesting and demand of customers and then feedback sign From the association rule of data mining we can know what the most users need, and which pages users prefer To the governmental institutions and enterprises, it\220s the very important information, because governmental nd the need of people ke more convenient measurement, and enterprises can know how to get more commercial chances fuzzy set theory on exports weights and combined data mining algorithms to achieve the following purposes 1\Finding the association rule of web pages the users prefer from the records of browsing 2\Using the above association rule to improve the design of web to gain more chances of trading 3\Improve the governmental institutions\220 webs to make more convenience for people to get useful information  2.

useful information through systemic fuzzy operation  According to the principle of fuzzy set intersection some scholars put forward min-operand algorithm [2  in order to find out the mini among several triangle fuzzy number. But the purpose of the max-operand algorithm is finding out the max among the several triangle fuzzy number. In this paper we find out the min-supported items with fuzzy set max-operand and gather these filtered items as a large item sets. Next we get the large items intersection by combining each two large items with min-operand, and then take the results as the candidate item sets 2.3 Maximum Forward Reference When the user wants to find the interesting information, he or she will shift one page to another page, and if the user backs the page, we suppose that he or she is just for convenience not for browsing. So we just mine the Forward Reference Sequence of Access Patterns, and we take the back browsing as the finishing of Forward Reference Path, and we call this nce as Maximum Forward Reference. [4 5 8 9   1 0   When uses browse the web, the browsing path will be kept on the web log in the server. We can analyze uses\220 action on the website through the browsing path And also we can mine the Maximum Forward Reference from web logs 3. Methods and steps There are two parts in the Apriori Algorithm; the first part is scanning data base to find out the support of every item then filtering the Minimum support item according the given Minimum support; the second one is setting Minimum Confidence, the main purpose is checking the association rule. We use fuzzy maxoperand to compare with two triangle fuzzy items on filtering the above Minimum support and Minimum confidence On the process of filtering large item sets in Apriori we must combine each two low power large itemsets to generate high power candidate itemsets. The process of combination is finding the intersection of two triangle fuzzy number, so we use fuzzy min-operand to deal with the intersection to get a new one. The study bases on Apriori algorithm of data mining technology, and uses Maximum Forward Reference to analyze the browsing path to take out the pages users are most d in, then combines Fuzzy Set Theory, adds the fuzzy weight, calculates the weight between each two candidate item sets with fuzzy min-operand just like using exports weight dealing with triangle fuzzy items, at last, compares the items with min-support and min-confidence with fuzzy max-operand Now we can find out the association rule of each pages of web. To the governmental institutions, it can advance the performance of serving; to the enterprises it can improve the design of web and provide more useful information according to the browsing action and the interesting information of users The process of this web mining including: coding ports transforming the pages into triangle fuzzy numbers according to the exports weight, calculating the support giving minimum support, filtering candidate itemsets to get large itemset, combining the large itemsets as candidate itemsets, giving minimum confidence checking minimum confidence and minimum support then forming the association rule 4. Example According to the above algorithm, we take the web ver as example to explicate the whole steps of generating the association rule  Step 1 Coding There are seventeen pages in our website default.htm, product.htm, enterprise_intro.htm and so on. We code A, B, C\203Q as the page of the above seventeen pages  Step 2 Extracting original data In the web log of server, some user\220s browsing path is {A,B,C,B,H,B,C,D,C,F,C,D,E,D,C,G,C,B,H,I,J,A,K L,M,L,N,L,P,O,Q}. We get the Maximum Forward Reference Sequence in the browsing path in the table 1 Table 1 the MFReference Sequence of the browsing path NO The results of mining 1 ABC 2 ABH 3 ABCD 4 ABCF 5 ABCDE 6 ABCD 7 ABCG 8 ABC 9 ABHIJ 10 AKLM 11 AKLN 12 AKLPOQ Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


um Forward Reference Sequence with above method and store them in the database Step 3 Giving weight by exports We ask exports to evaluate the website, and according to the weight we divide the pages into five groups, very important, important, common unimportant and extraordinary unimportant, just shown in table 2 Table 2 the weight of pages Page Weight The NO. of page very important A,B,C,H,K,L important D,E,I,N common F,G unimportant J,M extraordinary unimportant O,P,Q Step 4 Transforming the pages into triangle fuzzy numbers according to the exports weight We transform the pages into triangle fuzzy numbers according to the exports weight as table 3 Table 3 the triangle fuzzy number of pages\220 weight Page Weight Triangle Fuzzy Number very important 0.75,1,1 important \(0.5,0.75,1 common \(0.25,0.5,0.75 unimportant \(0,0.25,0.5 extraordinary unimportant 0,0,0.25 Step 5 Calculating the support e rward Reference Sequence in table 1 Firstly, we count up the appearing times of every page the result as in table 4 Table 4 the appearing times of pages Pages Time s Pages Time s A 12 I 1 B 9 J 1 C 7 K 3 D 3 L 3 E 1 M 1 F 1 N 1 G 1 O 1 H 2 P 1  Q 1 e appearing times of every page in all records, and multiply the corresponding fuzzy weight, the result is the fuzzy support of every page. The process of transforming is in the table 5 Table 5 transforming the item support into fuzzy support Ite m The proportion of item appearing times Fuzzy weight Fuzzy support SX  A 12/12=1 \(0.75,1,1\ \(0.75,1,1 B 9/12=0.75 \(0.75,1,1\ \(0.563,0.75,0.75 C 7/12=0.583 \(0.75,1,1 0.437,0.583,0.583 D 1\ \(0.125,0.188,0.25 E 1/12=0.083 \(0.5,0.75,1\ \(0.042,0.062,0.083 F 0.5,0.75\\(0.02,0.042,0.062 G 1/12=0.083 \(0.25,0.5,0.75\\(0.02,0.042,0.062 H 2/12=0.167 \(0.75,1,1 0.125,0.167,0.167 I 1/12=0.083 \(0.5,0.75,1\ \(0.042,0.062,0.083 J 1/12=0.083 \(0,0.25,0.5\ \(0,0.02,0.042 K 3/12=0.25 \(0.75,1,1\ \(0.188,0.25,0.25 L 3/12=0.25 \(0.75,1,1\ \(0.188,0.25,0.25 M 1/12=0.083 \(0,0.25,0.5\ \(0,0.02,0.042 N 1/12=0.083 \(0.5,0.75,1\ \(0.042,0.062,0.083 O 1/12=0.083 \(0,0,0.25 0,0,0.02 P 1/12=0.083 \(0,0,0.25 0,0,0.02 Q 1/12=0.083 \(0,0,0.25 0,0,0.02 Step 6 Giving the Minimum Support Here we suppose the percentage of Minimum Support zzy number \(0.5 0.75 1\ , the result is the Minimum Support \(SMIN\, so SMIN=30 003\273 327 \(0.5,0.75,1 002\331 0.15,0.225,0.3 Step 7 Filtering the candidate itemsets to get the large itemset We take the max-operand operation of the fuzzy support from step5 and the minimum support from step 6 to get the minimum support filtered items and gather them as large itemsets. We take page A as example to explain the process of the filtering. From step 5, we can know the support of page A SA=\(0.75,1,1\, the minimum support SMIN=\(0.15,0.225,0.3\ and according to the triangle fuzzy operation we can know S A 002\332 S MIN From the above example we can know that page A can become one of the large itemsets by minimum support filtering. According to the above process of calculating, we can get 1-large itemset is {A, B, C Step 8 Combining the large itemsets as candidate itemsets Proceedings of the 2005 The Fifth International Confer ence on Computer and Information Technology \(CIT\22205 0-7695-2432-X/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


We can get the intersection of large items by combining the each two large items with triangle fuzzy min-operand. We call the result of candidate as 1 large itemset.    We take the page A and page B as s, the intersection of SA and SB is I I\(a ,b ,c\=\(0.563,0.75,0.75 According to the above operation, we can get 2Candidate itemset by taking triangle fuzzy minoperand operation of each two large items of 1-large itemset. Then repeat the step 7and step 8 until no other candidate itemsets can be generated; we can get all combination of large items and support shown in table 6 Table 6 the combination and support of large items Single large item Support A \(0.75,1,1 75 C \(0.437,0.583,0.583 The combination of two large items Support 75 583 BC \(0.437,0.574,0.583 The combination of three large items Support ABC \(0.437,0.574,0.583 Step 9 Giving the Minimum Confidence Here we suppose the percentage of minimum confidence is 40%, and multiply it by the important triangle fuzzy number \(0.5, 0.75 1\ , the result is the minimum confidence, so C MIN 40 003\273 327 \(0.5,0.75,1 002\331 0.2,0.3,0.4 Step 10 Checking the confidence to get the association During the course of checking, we use conditional probability C Prob Y|X\\(X 001 Y\/P\(X\ If the probability of Y 000\225 e condition of X, an association rule is generated which accords with minimum confidence. If there is an association rule exists between X and Y, it can be expressed as If X Then Y, means that if X appeared, Y will appear too. In the operation results of our example we get the combination of {AB,AC,BC,ABC}, so there are five kinds of association rule IF A then B; IF A then C; IF B then C IF A then B and C; IF A and B then C Among the above association rules, take IF A then B as example, on the condition of A, the probability of B is Prob\(B|A\\(A 001 B\/P\(A\=9/12=0.75 Then we multiply the Prob B|A\0.75 by the triangle fuzzy number of the intersection of A and B calculated by fuzzy minimum operator 0.75\327 \(0.563,0.75,0.75\=\(0.422,0.5625,0.5625 So we get the confidence of rule IF A then B is 0.422,0.5625,0.5625 We separately calculate the conditional probability and confidence of other combinations and checking them with the minimum confidence supposed in step 9 We use fuzzy maximum operator to check them, firstly we get the two maximum triangle numbers, secondly compare the similitude between maximum and triangle fuzzy numbers. The results are shown in the table 7 Table 7 the possible association rules and its confidence A s s o ciat io n R u l e  Condi t i on a l  Pr o b ab il it y  C o n f id en ce Minim um C o n f id en ce Ex i s tin g as s o ciati o n  ru l e O r  n o t  IF A then B 0.75 0.422,0.563,0.563  0.2,0.3,0.4  Yes IF A then C 0.583 0.255,0.34,0.34 0.2,0.3,0.4  No IF B then C 0.778 0.34,0.447,0.454\ \(0.2,0.3,0.4 Yes IF A then B and C 0.583 0.255,0.335,0.34 0.2,0.3,0.4  No IF A and B then C 0.778 0.34,0.447,0.454 0.2,0.3,0.4  Yes we finally get the following three association rules IF A then B; IF B then C; IF A and B then C We take \215IF A then B\216 as an example, this rule means that if user browses page A, he or she will browse page B probably. , on the other words, it means that the relation between page A and page B is very close. To the users, there are useful information existing on page A and page B, so the probability of continuing visiting on page A and page B is very high To the enterprises, if they know the rule, they must strengthen the convenience between page A and page B in order to make more convenience for users 5.

are independent and consequently there is no interest in the relationship of attributes A and B Brin et. al. [3] proposed the symmetric measure to identify correlation of attributes rather. A correlation of 1 indicates no interest, values greater than 1 indicate support for A + B and less than 1 for A + 7 B .  Acceotance of an for descriptive associations is simply the difference between association is based on the chisquared statistic 511 The ranges given in Table I are produced by the assessment of crisp data. In particular, the derivation of these ranges utilize the equality N \( A A&amp;E A&amp;-B This relationship does not necessarily hold when A and B are fuzzy sets Numerous other methods for the measurement of associa tions and attribute relationships have been proposed 1131, [22 The measures discussed above were selected as representa tives of the general classes of confdence and interestingness measures that have natural interpretations in terms of the comparison of examples and counterexamples v. INTERVAL MEASURES By the arguments in Section III, any T-norm  3 whose values are hounded by zy 5 z  3 y 5 min{z,y} is suitable for determining the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint property from the marginal membership functions. In this section we examine several examples to gain an intuitive understanding of the range of values that can he produced assessing co-occurrence and interest of fuzzy attributes in this manner Once the number of examples of the marginal and joint properties are determined, the validity measures can he ob tained utilizing the formulas in Table 1. We begin with the following simple data set in which the membership values of the tuples exhibit a perfect gradual relationship TI: nu;her A i !  E 0.2 0.2 1 0.1 0.1 Using the T-norm min, the number of examples of A&amp;B is 2.0, of A&amp;-B is 0.6, and of -A&amp;-B is 2.0. The corre sponding values for the product T-norm are 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5 The measures yield con min 0.8 prod 0.39 confd  mnfC rat ~i COTT 0.1 0.03 3.3 0.15 1.6 0.12 -0.07 0.76 -0.05 0.78 Due to the symmetry in the data, the number of examples of A&amp;B and -A&amp;TB are identical. This causes confd and rat to have neutral values for both T-norms. In this case, the selection of the T-norm causes a signifcant variation in the result only in the case of standard confdence and correlation The next example considers tuples that would intuitively support a certainty relationship between A and B. That is, the Dienes implication max\(1- A\(a b C m  confd min 1.0 0.0 prod 0.75 0.0 of these tuples 0.2 0.1 cmfc Tat Ti COTT 0.2 1.0 0.25 2.0 0.25 1.0 0.23 1.5 B\(b 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.9 512 


512 The T-norms min produce 2.0 examples of A&amp;B, 0.6 of A&amp;+3, and 0.6 of -A&amp;-B. The corresponding values for the product T-norm are 1.7, 0.3, and 0.3. The measures yield prod I 0.85 I 0.7 I 0.35 I 5.7 I 0.0 1 0.0 As with the data in TI, there is a notable difference between the confdence measures with the two T-norms. There are also differences in the ratio of examples to counterexamples and the interest measures. The analysis of the examples generated by the minimum indicate that the association A =$ B may he of interest. However, with the examples produced by the product T-norm, both of the interest measures are neutral One fnal example considers tuples tuples with no discem able pattem af T m={a,b,p with parameter p .  Setting p to 0 produces the minimum and 1 produces the product. For a particular set of data, the optimal T-norm could he identifed by Ending the value of the parameterp E [0,1] that maximizes the validity measure under consideration. The optimization could use either algebraic or numeric methods, hut the latter seem more suitable for the analysis of large data sets VI. CONCLUSION The determination of the degree that a tuple is an example of a fuzzy rule or association depends upon the underlying relationship between the attributes. In data mining, this re lationship is not known a number of possible methods for determining 'examplehood' should be considered. When the attribute domains are covered or partitioned by the predicates the relationship between joint and marginal distributions im pose restrictions on the suitability of T-norms to evaluate the degree a tuple is an example of an association. The parametric representations of T-norms presents the possibility of simultaneously learning both the relationship between the attributes and the proper assessment of the number of examples and counterexamples REFERENCES I] C.

efficiency then AOFI. However utilization of fuzzy concept hierarchies provides more flexibility in reflecting expert knowledge and so allows better modeling of real-life dependencies among attribute values, which will lead to more satisfactory overall results for the induction process. The drawback of the computational cost may additionally decline when we notice that, in contrast to many other data mining algorithms, hierarchical induction algorithms need to run only once through the original \(i.e. massive dataset. We are continuing an investigation of computational costs of our approach for large datasets ACKNOWLEDGMENT Rafal Angryk would like to thank the Montana NASA EPSCoR Grant Consortium for sponsoring this research REFERENCES 1] J.

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter.

In all cases, we achieve high compression rate \(e.g., the rate is 25% for res=25 evaluate the query efficiency, we first set the resolution to the median value 50, and use the sketch index to answer workloads with various qrlen \(qtlen=10

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
