 Abstract Educational resources is very rich, but the utilization rate is very low Tthere is a lot of redundancy and waste., To the whole education it would be a big step forward if  We can integrate educational resources with  the Internet to achieve the sharing of resources. Peer-to-Peer technology to share resources solves the problem. But some of the shortcomings of its own  bring a number of other issues. This article on the P2P security trust propose a trust model-Adaptive Cluster-based Trust Model 
which solves  these problems caused by P2P application security mechanisms to education Key words P2P Resource sharing trust ACTM  1. Introduction  In the information-based society, teaching resources are an essential component of learning and teaching activities which attract the increasing concern of teachers. Construction of resources has also become 
one of the priorities of teaching in many schools.It is also important  to integrate these resources including state investment, the modern library concept, advanced technology means ,a wealth of literature and human resources in colleges together to build information resources to achieve the knowledge sharing in order to maximize the social and economic benefits.When it comes to sharing, the network will undoubtedly become the first choice to solve the problem, P2P technology ,which applied to the distributed network precisely adapted to this requirement.In the P2P model the network participants are on an equal footing, not only  the client server is resource providers and access 
to those resources, the participants  also share their own hardware resources, which are provided by network services and content and shared by other direct access without going through the middle of entities.In P2P model ,it is difficult to determine a relationship of trust between entities, so if there is a safe mode to P2P technology to share resources, the problem will be solved. In this paper,to solve the security trust issue,we propose a cluster-based trust model for P2P networks.In this model ,different clusters gain different degrees of confidence, and are given different weights, so the model can solve safety issues on sharing resources 
 2. Related Research  2.1.P2P  Peer-to-peer networking is considdered as a perception that  will strengthen the network of exchange, document exchange, distributed computing and so on.To be briefly, P2P link directly to the people and allow people to directly interact through the Internet.P2P nerworks make communication be easier more direct and interactive sharing.One can directly connect to other computer users to exchange files though P2P, rather than as in the past to connect to the server and downloaded by the browser.Users can also 
participate in the interner. Therefore, P2P has the following characteristics Distributed. Resources and services are distributed in the network on each client, and there is no centralized server, which is different from the C/S model.That resources and information transmiss between the nodes directly improve the efficiency greatly.In the resources sharing in teaching, colleges and universities  composite a star-shaped network , and each one can be considered as a note ,so  the effective integration of resourcescan be achieved  through communicate between each other Flexibility. Each node is a server an client, and this 
characteristics makes P2P model can be expanded and the entire system can be continuously expanded and The research is sponsored by Younth Foundation of China University of Mining Technology\(No.2007A040  _____________________________ 978-1-4244-3930-0/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 


enriched, ultimately the formation of a huge resource library Efficiency. In P2P model ,the servers are located in all nodes, but the storage capacity is greatly increased so idle computer terminals is made full use and the purposes of high-performance computing and mass storage is achieved Dynamics and uncertainties. Beside the absence of a fixed server, that each node has a considerable flexibility also determines the instability of P2P, which is dynamic and uncertainties. Each node in the network has resources, but different nodes have different capabilities, and this is similar to business models of the board of directors with some difference at the same time .Between the board members there is common interests, but between nodes there  is no common interests, so it is difficult to guarantee the control of individual user's malicious and fraudulent practices, it is main security problems of  P2P  2.2. Trust  Trust is a subjective concept and a nodeês confidence to the capacity, integrity and reliability of another node, it depends on the experience and the value of confidence is used to indicate the level of trust,while the value of trust changs with the dynamic changes of the nodeês behavior. Relations of trust in this article is divided into three categories: direct trust and indirect trust and recommendation trust.Direct trust is a quantitative evaluation given according to the situation of resource sharing ,when there had been a direct exchange between two notes in the same group.Indirect trust between two nodes means that there is no or few direct activities to carry out the sharing of resources , and it is difficult to give their own assessment and  needs the evaluation of the administrator group on the node through of trust built up.Recommended trust is that two nodes in different group, who will obtain an indirect assessment of confidence  by their respective group administrators on each node. In addition, there is a hidden trust. A feedback resulting trust will be generate, by two notes belonging to different groups through the establishment of trust in the relationship about  the resource sharing , to assess the sharing of resources and returned to the node manager, as a self-adjusting based on trust.Trust model, the assessment model of confidence ,which makes description ,evaluation measurement and adjustment of a trust relationship established  between the different nodes in the sharing of educational resources , automatic adjustments to create real-time trust through the  trust feedback value from the activities  3. ACTM  3.1.Related work  In this paper, adaptive cluster-based trust model for P2P networks is proposed. In ACTM, a limited number of the nodes compose groups in some relationships, of which a particular node being a group administrator for management and maintenance.Therefore, at the initialization, the Node Manager must be first of all, a credibility node its own, and is bound to keep groups in accordance with some confidence mechanism sharing trust feedback mechanism\to understand correctly of the group node level of trust.In addition the following basic definition are given Definition 1: A P2P network is figured by Fig P , P G, T\,we can use a node g While G gi Definition 2: Trust set T Td Ti Tr*Wi n Direct trust Td \(direct\as retain records of the evaluation of two-node who had resource sharing activities .Indirect trust Ti \(indirect defined as a evaluation record by group administrator of a node. Recommended trust Tr \(recommend\is defined as the record of evaluation of another group by a group administrator Confidence in the T range of 0 ~ 10, the threshold set in accordance with the specific network environment,When the trust is greater than the threshold value, two-node mutual trust can be determined and share the resources .This article provides that when T> 6, the node could be promised the security of mutual trust between the resourcesharing Initialization in the group, this article provides the highest confidence in the administrator as 10, the initial trust in general node as 8.If too small,the notes will never be able to access interactive opportunities and if too much , itês so prone to malicious acts of deceit and  difficult to remove from the group, causing the entire network to reduce the credit Definition 3. The weight of W, when communicating between nodes not in the same group the more the group across, the smaller weight will be therefore it will correspond to lower confidence.We definit, when calculating the trust node communications is over the largest number of network settings ,the distance is infinite, and its value of weight is 0, which can not be trusted.This article sets the maximum number of Groups 10, wi=1*\(10-i 0,10 


        Figure 1.Different clusters  3.2. ACTM model  In the P2P network, each node is both a server and the client, resources and information transmission between the various nodes directly. Therefore, on the discussion of ACTM trust model we can only consider any of the nodes trust between the set of nodes and trust between the group sets  3.2.1. internal node group trust computation model  For two nodes u, v belong to the internal group. If the access is direct and frequency, resource sharing just visit the direct trust Td, that is Ti Tr*Wi./n 0, without considering T= \(Tdu+Tdv this value is greater than the corresponding threshold T> 6, then they can visit again, in addition,based on the value of the new, the original value of the trust is amendmented\(Figure 1 Between two nodes if there is little or no current record, then it is necessary to review their respective evaluation of administrator of groups, the indirect trust Ti and colligation trust  T, according to the formula T Tdu+ Tiu +Tdv+ Tiv\ine the existence of the node security issues 3.2.2. external node group trust computation model  Two nodes ,q, t ,between any group, then tês trust for q is T=Td+ Tit Tr*Wi./n, empathy, qês trust to t is T=Td+ Tiq Tr*Wi, then we define their confidence for the integrated T= \(Tdq+ Tiq +Tdt+ Tit  Tr*Wi/n comprehensive set T trust . If there is a threshold less than the corresponding value range, it can not be seen as safe  3.2.3. the general model and its application  For any two nodes ,there are T= \(Tdq+ Tiq +Tdp Tip Tr*Wi/n\ula can also be used in the group of internal nodes, at this time Tr*Wi. ./n=0, formula becomes T= \(Tdq+ Tiq +Tdp Tip\if there is close contact nodes, we can overlook the indirect trust administrator, the formula for the continued degradation of T= \(Tdq+Tdp In order to be universal, we set up two nodes q, p are not in the same group \(A, D direct links  Figure 2. A simplified network model of the group P2P  However, A with B, C with D, B with C is directly linked to the existence of trust in the relationship according to the formula T = \(Tdq + Tiq + Tdp + Tip Tr * Wi.. / N\e to T= \(Tdq+ Tiq +Tdp+ Tip +\(Trab* W0+Trbc W1+Trcd* W2 The weight of wi=1*\(10-i\ing Tdq=8 Tiq=8 Tdp=9 Tip=7 Trab=8 Trbc=6 Trcd =9 Then T= \(Tdq+ Tiq +Tdp+ Tip+\(Trab*1+Trbc*0.9 Trcd *0.8\ore than the minimum confidence threshold, then q, p can share resource.Moreover, according to feedback received from them to remodify the trust to get a new trust In Figure1, there is a direct trust records in node p.q.u.v, The group manager A has an indirect trust records to p,q,u,v nodes the group administrator A recommendation has confidence in the existence of recommended to node r,s,t  3.3 Feedback mechanisms of trust in ACTM model  In the ACTM The relations of trust is divided into three levels: The trust between nodes in different groups, The trust between group and nodes inside the group, The trust between nodes at the same group. The basic idea of feedback mechanism is based on the transaction, nodes to other nodes establish trust between the local and group interaction and to outcome to the manager at the same time. Group Manager adjusts the trust relations between the internal nodes as well as the trust relationship between the other groups in accordance with feedback node of the group. To share the resources, if the group did not have the other nodes in the assessment of the trust that is, two nodes belonging to different groups then the node group to ask the stranger group manager to show infomation. When nodes from the group asked pq B A D C  C 


about the request to determine Groups judge where the node comes from to obtain the trust value. After the calculation of confidence, an indirect trust Ti will be got, after comparing with the thresholds from networkit can be determined whether to grant or denial the permission to share this resource. At the event refering to the trust mechanisms of social interpersonal relationships characterized, information of trust nodes can be quantified and  easy to compute a trust value Considering the success and failure times of shared resources  and use that as the basis to judge the degrees of trust and give punishments to the large numbers of failed nodes and show negative feedback. On the information submitted by malicious nodes ,it will do a rapid response, to make real-time adjustments as far as possible. The trust model can be updated in real time New nodes can interact through many times, to upgrade their level of trust  4. Performance Analysis  4.1 Disadvantages  The administrator of each group must be highly trusted nodes, otherwise the credibility of this group is low, and there is the possibility of malicious recommended Strange node is difficult to have a larger degree of confidence. While avoiding the occurrence of a dangerous probability, the worst-case scenario is the distance from any group is the infinite, so it is difficult to share resources. So a node must be added to the existing of a group when the group manager distributes initial trust value \(only have a necessary minimum of trust with the group administrator\hen the value is lower than the minimum, administrators have the right to  kick it out of the group node, and save the low relations of trust over a period of time so that nodes in other groups could inquire Adding a large number of unfamiliar node, may results in an excessive burden of group managers and then the impact of real-time trust model will be very bad. Therefore, confidence in high-performance computing algorithms, such as node-based pan-trust as a unit can be replaced by  a group, which may contributes to the reduction of such cases, but the bottleneck resources \(the upper limit of link remains  4.2 Advantages Every success of resource sharing will increases the trust value of node according to the calculation formula. The indirect trust recommends a corresponding increase between administrators and the node, which means the node obtains a better confidence. When it is over a certain value, they can exchange with the node outside the group, and obtain the right to share more resources. Otherwise, the trust will decline continuously. The group administrator owns the adaptive function Internal nodes of group only need to maintain the trust of local information, the administrator only need to maintain information about neighboring groups other nodes and group trust \(trust in the overall situation\can be calculated, so that the burden on the administratorês and the nodesê calculation substantially reduced The design of real-time self-tuning and recordkeeping model will help to maintain confidence value in the nodes. In the sharing of resources, nodeês a temporary leaving will not caused loss of confidence and it will not re-accumulate when to be asked to share  5. Conclusions  Since the emergence of P2P technology , it has been concerned widely. A single node in large- scale P2P network is less likely to repeat the interaction and is difficult to establish a trust relationship. This paper shows a model of relations of trust based on P2P network nodes. The sharing of resources between the colleges or universities or between university and community through this model, and hopes that a better share management organization is able to be formed to share the educational resources. Trust model quantifies the information of resources node in order to value the possibility of interaction, solving the problem of transaction in the security, and contributes a lot to run a safe and effective P2P sharing network  6.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services.
