Methods Based on the clinical data of 6290 cases of 
pneumonia in children, to study the relationship between the pneumonia clinical features and the pathogens of pneumonia in children by making use of association rules. Results Through software analysis, the different association relationship can be got between the different clinical features of pneumonia in children such as gender, age and region, etc., and the pathogens of pneumonia. For example, between the same pathogen and different sex show the different association relationship. Due to the different association relationships between the pneumonia clinical features and the pathogens of pneumonia in children, so the differences methods in prevention and treatment of 
Guangzhou area child pneumonia should be adopted according to actual condition, for different clinical features of children take different means, in order to achieve the best effect. Conclusion  The association rule can be adopted to analyze the relationship between the pneumonia clinical features and the pathogens of pneumonia in children, and to explore the multi-association relationship between the pneumonia clinical features and the pathogens of pneumonia in children Keywords Pathogen Pneumonia Children Association Rules Clinical Features I I NTRODUCTION Pneumonia is the first cause of death under 5 year 
s old in the world's children accounting for about 20% of deaths. In China, the annual total of about 21 million children with pneumonia, it has become leading cause of death under 5 year s old children, a considerable portion of which is caused by pneumococcus. According to WHO statistics, about 1 million children under 5 year s old children died of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, meningitis and sepsis and other diseases every year in the worldwide[1  A m ong th e diseas e s which all can be vaccinated against, pneumococcal disease is the first disease, which caused the death under 5 year s old children. Therefore need to actively strengthen the prevention and treatment of clinical pneumonia in children, to reduce pneumonia in children with severe pneumonia morbidity and 
mortality Different pathogens have different susceptible population During the epidemic, Pathogen types and categories also vary And infections can be mixed with a few different pathogens Pneumonia and other serious respiratory infections are caused by the respiratory syncytial virus \(RSV\luenza virus \(FV and adenovirus \(ADV\ in childre n, and even lead to death 36.5% children with RSV infection can cause pneumonia, the mortality rate 1 3 ã; 28 children with influenza virus can cause pneumonia, the mortality rate 3.10%; ADV infections can also cause severe pneumonia in children, in the deaths of children due to seve re pneumonia autopsy specimens ADV infection was detected in 9.14%. The three virus infection can cause some popular spread. But for children 
RSV, FV, and pneumonia in children with ADV infection had no clear effects, safe treatments For now, antibiotics are the main drug to treat the pneumonia, which is the only effective treatment method. But with the long-standing abuse of antibiotics, pneumococcal resistance to antibiotics is growing. Currently, the treatment of pneumococcal disease gets more and more difficult, the rising cost of the treatment cycle is getting longer and longer, mainly because of growing bacterial resistance. The pneumococcal vaccine can actually prevent the di sease, so, it is important of pneumonia prevention in children. It is necessary to understand the pneumonia gender, age, season and annual distribution of clinical characteristics, it can be found the distribution and the law of pneumococcal disease through the 
analysis of disease character istics of different regions pneumonia children Association rules [2,3 e m o st acti v e  data mining research methods, it can find the implicit knowledge present in the data Therefore, this study used association rules and clinical features of pneumonia in children between different types of pathogenic association This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the principal of association rules Section 3 gives the clinical data and calculation the association ru les. Experiment results are discussed in section 4. Finally section 5 concludes the paper II A PRIOR A LGORITHM Association analysis focuses on discovering association rules which are interesting and useful hidden relationships that can be found in large data sets 
The Apriori algorithm is the original association rule algorithm. The Apriori Algorithm [4 proposed by Agrawal et. al. in 1994, finds frequent items in a given data set using the anti-mon otone constraint [5-7 Th i s  algorithm embodies the following Given a data set, the problem of association rule mining is to generate all rules that have suppor t and confidence greater than user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively   ___________________________________  978161284 70 4 7/11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


Candidate sets having k items can be generated by joining large sets having k-1 items, and deleting those that contain a subset that is not large \(where large refers to support above minimum support Frequent sets of items with minimum support form the basis for deriving association rules with minimum confidence. For A=>B to hold with confidence C, C% of the transactions having A must also have B The Apriori algorithm from is the basic candidategeneration-and-test algorithm It is based on the Apriori principle, which says that the item set X containing item set X is never large if item set X is no t large. Based on this principle the Apriori algorithm generates a set of candidate large item sets whose lengths are 1  k from the large k-item sets for k 1 and eliminates those candidates, which contain not large subset. Then, for the rest cand idates, supports are counted and only those with support over minsup threshold are taken to be large 1  k item sets Hereês the general idea, use k item sets to explore 1  k item sets 1 first find the set of frequent 1-itemsets k L this is done by scanning the database and accumulating the count for each item and then keeping those that meet the minimum support in a new set called k L  2 Then use k L to find 1  k C the set of candidate 2itemsets\- This is a two step process that 3 first generates 1  k C based on k L and then 4 secondly prunes 1  k C by getting rid of those 1  k C item sets using the Apriori principle 5 find 1  k L we do this by finding the support count for all the item sets in 1  k C and getting rid of those that are below the minsup 6 continue step 2&3 until no new frequent 1  k item set are found III E XPERIMENT USING APRIORI ALGORITHM 1 Cases from the Guangzhou Children's Hospital hospitalized with pneumonia in children from 2005 to 2009, a total of 6290 cases, including pneumonia gender, age, region, year, and other aspects of efficacy 2\ent of cases database The clinical data of the 6290 cop ies of the original are saved to Excel spreadsheet files, which retain the children's sex, age season, year, place of residen ce and other clinical features of pneumonia pathogen information in children, analyze the correlation between the clinical characteristics of pneumonia and pathogen 3\ Calculation using the apriori algorithm In this study, experiments are applied using Clementine 11.1. Analysis the pneumonia association rules in children according to gender, age, region, year, and pathogen pneumonia. Access association rules between the clinical features of pneumonia and pathogen in children using the minimum support \(8%\d minimum confidence \(25 4\Construction of the network map Network diagram is a graphics description of correlation Degree on different things. Set the major frequency of symptoms appearing in the network diagrams, which are got using statistical software Clementine 11.1 In the network diagram, if a straight line connecting the two units, two kinds of units have a common appeared probability, the more coarse lines, said the higher co-occurrence probability IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS 1 pneumonia pathogen statistic results Study the distribution of different pathogens, the overall statistics of the data to get pneu monia in children of different pathogens, the results shown in table1 and Figure 1 Table1: pneumonia pathogen Statistics               Figure 1 pneumonia pathogen Statistics In Figure 1 it can be shown that 2095 cases of bronchial pneumonia without pathogens were detected in hospitalized children, accounting for 33.31% of the total number of children; Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia is 1377 cases accounting for 21.89% of the total number; Mycoplasma pneumonia is 1221 cases, accounting for 19.41% of the total number; and other pneumonias are a relatively small proportion in children It can be described that it is more important factors that hospitalized children with pneumonia in asthmatic bronchial pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia 2 Relationship between Gender and a Variety of Pathogens In order to study the association relationship between gender and various pathogens in children, through the overall analysis of the hospitalized children data, the results is got shown in Figure 2 Type Count Percent Asthmatic bronchial pneumonia 2095 33.31 Respiratory syncytial pneumonia 1377 21.89 Mycoplasma pneumonia 1221 19.41 Chlamydia pneumonia 503 8 Adenoviral pneumonia 461 7.33 Influenza pneumonia 437 6.95 Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria 137 2.18 Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia 32 0.51 Severe pneumonia 27 0.43 


From figure 2, it can be given that male children are the highest correlation asthmatic bronchial pneumonia, and women are associated with the highest degree of mycoplasma pneumonia. In addition, th ere is different association relationship between children of different gender and pathogens Male patients in children should enhance the treatment with asthmatic bronchial pneumonia treatment female patients in children should be strengthened the treatment and prevention with mycoplasma pneumonia chlamydia pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia treatment Figure 2  the association relationship between gender and a variety of pathogens 3 Relationship between Age a nd a Variety of Pathogens To facilitate the study, the actual age of children is classified as follows 0-1 years \(infants\years <age <or equal to 1 year; 1-3 years \(early childhood\ear <age <or equal to 3 years; 3-6 years \(preschool\ears <age <or equal to 6 years; 6-14 years \(school-age\years <age <or equal to 14 years; It gets the results of Figure 3 between the age and the disease name by the degree of support and confidence Figure 3  the relationship between age and various pathogens It can be seen from Figure 3 that with the highest infant children is associated respiratory syncytial pneumonia followed by asthmatic bronchial pneumonia. Early childhood with mycoplasma pneumonia has the highest correlation Preschool children with mycoplasma pneumonia have the highest correlation, indicating that preschool children with mycoplasma pneumonia and asthmatic bronchial pneumonia are more worthy of attention. Mostly school-age children with mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia, asthmatic bronchial pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia are in the lower proportion of school-age children Pneumonias in children of different age segments are pathogenic differences 4  the relationship between va rious pathogens and year that children got pneumonia According to the analysis of different years that children got pneumonia and various pathogens, it can be shown the results in figure 4 In 2005, children with pneumonia, adenoviral pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumonia have strong association rules which the asthmatic bronchial pneumonia is the most prominent among them, and ther e is a positive correlation. In 2006 mycoplasma pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia also has a strong association rules. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, it can be seen that the adenoviral pneumonia has been a strong association rules.  Fr om above, it can be got that pneumonia pathogens in different years are different Figure 4  the relationship between various pathogens and year that children got pneumonia 5  the relationship between the region and a variety of pathogenic For better analysis of variou s pathogens and the place of residence to analysis the d ata to different regions of Guangzhou and the other around the city of Guangzhou, the results is shown in Figure 5 Figure 5 the relationship between region and variety of pathogenic 


Baiyun District is the strong est association relationship with the respiratory syncytial pneumonia; for respiratory syncytial virus, it's confidence is more or less in the different regions basically about 20%, indicating between it and the region there is no obvious correlation; it can be seen from the results that influenza viral pneumonia and adenoviral pneumonia are not correlation with regions; mycoplasma pneumonia is mainly concentrated in the Haizhu District and Baiyun District Chlamydia pneumonia is concentrated in the Haizhu District This shows that pneumonia in different pathogens have different associations with different regions V C ONCLUSION Association rules can be found the implicit knowledge in the data, be able to identify multi-dimensional association rules in the data In order to im prove the model accuracy in practical applications, usually with minimum support minimum confidence to measure the degree of association rules, only the support and confid ence are greater than the specified minimum number that the association rules is in line with the requirements of an association rules model In this study, analysis the association relationship between pathogenic characteristics and pneumonia on hospitalized children in order to provide a new perspective on the pneumonia in children. The results showed that 1\nship between Gender and a Variety of Pathogens Different types of infection, the absolute number of male children with pneumonia were higher than female patients further it gives the validation that male children are more susceptible to infectious diseases than female children This suggests that Male children should be focused on prevention and treatment as a target on pneumonia pathogens in Guangzhou 2\the relationship between age and various pathogens The number of pneumonia in children increased with age is decreasing for different types of pathogens It suggests that as age increases, children's abilit y to resist pathogen infection gradually is increasing. The peaks pneumonia in children, such as asthmatic bronchial pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia,  are all in infancy and early childhood, it is time to focus on strengthening the infancy and early childhood pneumonia in children treatment and prevention. For preschool and school-age children, the main infection is mycoplasma pneumonia, so pneumonia pathogens should be aware of mycoplasma pneumonia infection in the preschool and school-age children 3\ the relationship between various pathogens and year that children got pneumonia Several pathogens are differ ent in different years that children got pneumonia Asthmatic bronchial pneumonia has been a major component of bronchial pneumonia in hospitalized pneumonia children each year, so it should have been in treatment and prevention as a priority The number of pneumonia in children, with The respiratory syncytial virus mycoplasma pneumonia, is different in different years in five years , it suggests that it different pathogen infection prevention and control of clinical pneumonia in children should be according to an annual basis and should enhance the infection of different pathogens annual monitoring 4\e relationship between the region and a variety of pathogenic  Several different distributio n of pneumonia in children living in areas marked differences. Children with mycoplasma pneumonia is main ly in the Haizhu District and Baiyun District, Children with chlamydia pneumonia is concentrated in the Haizhu District, children with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus and adenovirus viral pneumonia is no obvious correlation with the residence It suggests that in the prevention of pneumonia, the pathogen should be noted that according to different region A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Social Science Foundation for the Youth Scholars of Ministry of Education of China Grant No. 10YJC630236, supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant No 2011ZM0080, supported by Guangdong Medical Research Foundation of Science and Technology Grant No. 2010472 and Dr start-up fund of Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center Grant No.201008 R EFERENCES 1 u da n I Boschi PC Biloglav Z Mulholland K,Campbell H Epidemiology and etiology of childhood pneumonia J Bull World Health Organ 2008 86\(5\: 408-416 2  G o ng  y a nb ing  L u o ze ng g a ng G a o S i hua, N i Q i ng Y i  da n h u i  X i e  Yanming, Wang Yongyan,Cross-sectional Study on the Relationship between Formulas and Syndromes of Type 2 Diabetes Based on Association Rules, JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE 2010 51\(1\- 67 3 w u ji an hu  He j i a  He x i an j i an   W u p i n m a xiuq ia n g   T h e E x p l ora t ion of Application of Association Rules in the Medical Domain JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL MEDICINE 2005 3 240-243 4  R a ke s h A g r a w a l an d Ram a kr is h n a n S r ik an t  F a s t al g o r it hm s f o r m i n i ng  association rules in large databases.

 Figure 4  Compression of the action table from Nursery dataset of size 250Mb into FP-Tree with varying minimum support values VII  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we propose the action table as the ideal search domain for action rules mining. The action table transforms the complex problem of finding action rules from a plain decision table, into finding action rules from an action table. As a result, the problem of action rules mining is reformulated into association-mining In practice, we applied FAARM on the Hepatitis and Nursery datasets and compared the results and performances with AAR and ARD. Although the space and time complexity associated with generating the action table are O\(n 2 experiments show that FAARM has a better execution time on relatively small dataset, over ARD and AAR Generating the action table directly into the FP-Tree could mitigate the space complexity associated with action table. As a future work, we propose to look at parallel implementation of Apriori and FP-Growth to test the scalability of using the action table with large datasets R EFERENCES  1  Z.

Share-UFPM Algorithm According to our mining model description, each utility frequent pattern is also frequent. After Share-FPM algorithm finds all frequent patterns, the Share-UFPM algorithm scans the database once to check whether each frequent pattern candidate algorithm is as follow Algorithm 3 Share-UFPM Input:   S?, s Output:   UFP, utility frequent patterns in DB Method:  Call Share-UFPM\(S?, s

PERFORMANCE STUDY To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms, we have done extensive experiments on various kinds of datasets with different features. The experiments are based on a 2.4GMHz Pentium IV PC with 512MB main memory and 60 GB hard driver, running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All the programs are written in Microsoft/Visual C++6.0 The measured performance is algorithms execution time on the datasets with different minimum support threshold. The execution time only includes the disk reading time \(scan datasets output frequent patterns speed of disk writing A. Datasets and characteristics We use real world and synthetic data for our performance study. The basic characteristics of datasets are listed in the following The real world dataset called Retail is achieved from a retailing company. Retail contains products from various categories. There are 16469 items and 88162 transactions in the dataset. Each transaction consists of the products purchased by a customer at a time point. Its average transaction size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns size are 10.3 and 3. The size of this dataset is 4M The synthetic data sets which were used for the experiments were achieved from the online FIMI repository See the RUL: http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/. The data sets are T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K. In T10I4D100K, the average record size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns 


size are 10 and 4. In T40I10D100K, they are 40 and 10. The numbers of transactions in both two dataset are set to 100K There are exponentially numerous frequent patterns when the support threshold goes down B. Experimental results In order to mine the utility frequent patterns, we randomly generate the count of each item between 1 and 6. In fact, most items are in the low profit range, we synthetically generate utility values of each item from 0.01 to 10.00, using a log normal distribution. For instance, Fig.2 shows the distribution of the utility values of items in T10I4D100K 1432 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 N um be r o f i te m s Utility value  Figure 2.  Utility value distribution in T10I4D100K For selecting appropriate utility thresholds, we use the average transaction utility value to constraint the utility threshold instead of randomly choosing it. For example, in Table 1, where the average transaction utility value is 40. If the utility threshold is equal to 25%, it represents that ? = 10 40  25% =10 We compare the performance of Share-FPM with BUUFM [5], an up to date algorithm for utility frequent patterns 


mining. Fig.3 through Fig.5 show the performance curves of two algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-UFPM algorithm outperforms BU-UFM on all datasets, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops low enough 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ti m e S ec on ds  Minimum support \(%0 Share-UFPM BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 3.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
