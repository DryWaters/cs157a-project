and Distributed Systems Group Delft University of Technology the Netherlands T.M.Hegeman@student.tudelft.nl  B.I.Ghit M.Capota A.J.H.Hidders D.H.J.Epema A.Iosup  tudelft.nl Abstract The commoditization of big data analytics that is the deployment tuning and future development of big data processing platforms such as MapReduce relies on a thorough understanding of relevant use cases and workloads In this work we propose BTWorld a use case for time-based big data analytics that is representative for processing data collected periodically from a global-scale distributed system BTWorld enables a datadriven approach to understanding the evolution of BitTorrent a global le-sharing network that has over 100 million users and accounts for a third of todayês upstream trafìc We describe for this use case the analyst questions and the structure of a multi-terabyte data set We design a MapReduce-based logical workîow which includes three levels of data dependency inter-query inter-job and intra-jobÑand a query diversity that make the BTWorld use case challenging for todayês big data processing tools the workîow can be instantiated in various ways in the MapReduce stack Last we instantiate this complex workîow using PigÖHadoopÖHDFS and evaluate the use case empirically Our MapReduce use case has challenging features small kilobytes to large 250 MB data sizes per observed item excellent  10  6  and very poor  10 2  selectivity and short seconds to long hours job duration I I NTRODUCTION Time-based analytics that is extracting meaningful information out of a very large set of timestamped information is challenging for existing data processing systems such as the popular MapReduce-based Hadoop 2 3 which must be operated efìciently to achieve good performance cheaply Understanding the w orkload through use cases or real-workload traces can signiìcantly help tune existing systems 6 and impro v e future-system designs 7 In this work we present the BTWorld use case for timebased big data analytics which aims at understanding the recent evolution of BitTorrent a major Internet application with signiìcant trafìc and over 100 million users Our use case extends prior work on MapReduce workloads with a comprehensive use case that focuses on a new application domain increased diversity of analytics a workîow of coupled MapReduce jobs and an empirical study based on a multiyear data set With BTWorld we are also able to extend over a decade of theoretical BitTorrent research with knowledge that can only be acquired from a big-data-driven study We further discuss the idea of extending the BTWorld use case towards a benchmark suite for time-based analytics platforms Time-based analytics can lead to knowledge otherwise inaccessible to analysts but pose interesting new challenges to big data processing systems Large amounts of time-stamped new records are added periodically to a continuously growing data set creating time series of various lengths Studying the evolution in time of an observed system that may include tens of millions of objects as the use case introduced in Section II does may involve algorithms for log processing that have variable complexity based on both the amount of the data that needs to be mined and the operations performed on the data The analyst may ask for various operations including through SQL-like aggregations selections joins or projections The analyst may also formulate complex queries that involve large amounts of or even the entire data set such as What is the evolution of the most relevant objects in the system over the entire measurement Minimizing the amount of the data processed by each query understanding and exploiting data reuse selecting the order of execution for the queries and many other approaches must be designed automated and tuned for efìciently managing the query workîow Designing automating and tuning data processing systems all rely on a good understanding of the workload and in particular of three main types of data dependency Inter-query dependencies occur when the output of a query can be reused as input by another For example the most popular K items sold by a chain of stores can be extracted from the output of a query that computes the most popular K items for each store Inter-job dependencies occur when complex queries with different operators are translated into workîows of jobs such that jobs cannot start before the output of their predecessors is materialized A common example of inter-job data dependency is given by the TeraSort benchmark which includes three jobs for data generation actual sorting and output validation Intra-job dependencies occur when data-intensive frameworks exploit the available job parallelism by breaking down each job into multiple tasks In many popular programming models from the 1990s BSP to the modern MapReduce a job may have one or even multiple synchronization points which split\(s the computation into multiple phases with identical tasks within each phase but possibly distinct tasks between different phases For MapReduce there are two main phases the map phase which performs a group by on each partition of the data set followed by the reduce phase which aggregates the output of the map phase We focus in this work on the BTWorld use case as an example of big data time-based analytics In particular we focus on a MapReduce-based workîow and implementation with a broader discussion towards a benchmark for time-based 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data

analytics platforms The MapReduce programming model has caught the attention of many scientiìc and engineering laboratories around the world with over 10 000 distinct programs implemented only at Google thousands of updates provided by the leading providers of commercial MapReduce software stacks to the open-source Hadoop and hundreds of thousands of processors managed with the Hadoop main middleware Prior w ork has already focused on understanding MapReduce workloads 13 12 presented several MapReduce use-cases 7 or focused on MapReduce benchmarking suites 16 17 In contrast our work focuses on a new application domain a large input data set and a real and complex data processing workîow with diverse queries Our main contribution is three-fold 1 We describe a use case for big data time-based analytics Section II Our use case BTWorld represents the observation of massive complex distributed systems operated by millions of usersÑthe global BitTorrent lesharing network We present the use case from a big data perspective focusing on a multi-year multi-terabyte data set and on a set of questions that the system analyst asks the data processing system to answer This use case can be very useful for the many domains that increasingly study large complex systems through data-driven approaches business intelligence and decision making computer science social sciences urban planning etc 2 We design a MapReduce-based logical workîow that can answer the set of questions that the system analyst asks Section III Our logical workîow for which queries exhibit all three levels of data dependency extends the current body of work in MapReduce use cases and benchmarks In practice the workîow can be implemented using various open-source and commercial tools from the MapReduce stack and thus enables their comparison for a relevant application domain 3 We implement the logical workîow using the Pig Latin HadoopÖHDFS MapReduce stack and conduct an empirical evaluation with subsets of increasing size extracted from the complete BTWorld data set Section IV We analyze system-level query-level and MapReduce joband task-level results We show evidence of the diversity of the queries proposed in terms of execution time and resource consumption including I/O II D ESCRIPTION OF THE BTW ORLD U SE C ASE In this section we describe the BTWorld use case from a big data perspective Started in 2009 and ongoing the BTWorld project aims to measure the global BitT orrent network which is the largest Internet application in terms of upstream trafìc generating 35 of global upstream trafìc in 2013 BTW orld collects periodically snapshots of the global BitTorrent network which it aims to use to answer many types of research questions We focus in this section in turn on BTWorld background and terminology on a multi-terabyte BTWorld data set and on exemplary research questions BTWorld aims to answer Outside the scope of this work we are gaining through BTWorld unique insights into the evolution of BitTorrent over the past 3.5 years extending and complementing over a decade of theoretical work A BitTorrent and BTWorld Overview BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer P2P le-sharing protocol whose success comes mainly from facilitating and incentivizing collaboration between peers BitTorrent breaks up les into SHA-1 hashed pieces that can be shared individually by peers even by peers who do not possess the complete le For each le shared in BitTorrent the le name and the hashes of its pieces form a metadata le a torrent  which is uniquely identiìed by a SHA-1 hash of the piece hashes and le name A swarm is a group of BitTorrent peers sharing the same torrent Among the peers of a swarm seeders posses all the pieces while leechers possess only some of the pieces and are downloading the remainder To help peers meet each other for example to join a swarm for the rst time BitTorrent also uses trackers  which are centralized servers that give upon request lists of peers in the swarm of a particular torrent Through this mechanism different trackers can generate different swarms for the same torrent BTWorld focuses on understanding BitTorrent and its evolution which have a signiìcant impact in the operation of the entire Internet Traditional BitTorrent theory such as the uid model of Qiu and Srikant can predict interesting steadystate phenomena but fails to account for complex transient behavior e.g ashcrowds for complex technical limitations e.g rewalls for complex inter-dependencies between global BitTorrent elements e.g legal and auto-feed effects etc As a consequence many important questions related to non-functional system propertiesÑavailability performance etc.Ñcannot be answered As an alternative with BTWorld we propose a data-driven approach to acquiring knowledge about BitTorrent and perhaps even general distributed systems By collecting data that can be used in statistical models machine learning and validation of theories BTWorld promises to solve many of the problems faced by the current theoretical approaches and to lead to new theories However a data-driven approach raises many challenges in building an efìcient scalable and cost-effective system for data processing and preservation B Data Collection Studying P2P networks is difìcult as it normally involves monitoring millions of non-cooperating computers Instead BTWorld focuses on collecting data from the public trackers of the global BitTorrent network BTWorld sends queries to  scrapes  each tracker and receives statistics about the aggregated status of peers for each swarm of the tracker the number of leechers the number of seeders and the total number of downloads since the creation of the torrent The data is collected by several Linux servers using wget  which is run at regular intervals by cron  The raw data is bencoded scrape data either plain te xt or gzip compressed depending on the tracker The data retrieved through wget is 623

directory structure Table I presents an overview of the data set collected by BTWorld since the project started in 2009 The total size of les amounts to more than 14 TB Figure 1 shows a CDF of the mean scrape size for all trackers in the data set The distribution is skewed the median scrape size is 23 kB but the largest 1 of the trackers return scrapes sized 200 250 MB Based on the observed mean sample size of 90 bytes we estimate the BTWorld data set at approximately 150 billion swarm samples For Section IV we use samples of the BTWorld data set ranging from 10 MB to 100 GB to avoid excessive experiment durations C P2P Analyst Questions The data collected by BTWorld during its more than 3.5 years of operation representing one of the largest longitudinal studies of P2P systems can be used to answer several questions of interest to peer-to-peer P2P analysts 8 BTWorld can shed light on the evolution of BitTorrent It captures phenomena such as the seasonal variety in peer population and the shift in the geographical location of the major trackers It can also show how BitTorrent usage changes Are the swarms becoming bigger Is the number of peers per tracker increasing The P2P analyst can extract information about the service level provided by BitTorrent to its users by examining the ratio between seeders and leechers in swarms which is known to be correlated with download speed and with se v ere degradation of performance during ashcrowds The life time of swarms is an indicator of reliability for ho w long are les available in the system What is the redundancy level of the system Is there an overlap between trackers Are the same hashes present at multiple trackers Furthermore the BTWorld data set contains information about the effect of legal and technical disruptions on the BitTorrent ecosystems It can sho w the decline of The Pirate Bay as the leading tracker as a result of a lawsuit against its operators and its replacement by OpenBitTorrent It also documents the existence of malicious spam trackers designed to impede BitTorrent operation       Fig 2 Our logical workîow occupies the high-level layer of the generic MapReduce software stack for data processing III M AP R EDUCE B ASED L OGICAL W ORKFLOW In this section we design a MapReduce-based data processing approach that can be used to answer the P2P analyst questions introduced in Section II-C Our design relies on the MapReduce stack explained in Section III-A which limits applicability to the MapReduce ecosystem but ensures that our approach can readily be implemented using a variety of opensource and commercial tools The approach we propose is to implement a logical workîow in a high-level language that can be mapped automatically to the MapReduce programming model and to a MapReduce execution engine The logical workîow which does not rely on any practical tool in the MapReduce stack consists of a data layout Section III-B and a workîow frame that coordinates the execution of several SQL-like queries Section III-C The MapReduce-friendly data layout and the diverse set of queries make the BTWorld logical workîow useful as a MapReduce use case A MapReduce Stack Overview Recently a general MapReduce stack has emerged as a convenient structure for the diverse ecosystem of open-source and commercial middleware that currently support the MapReduce programming model Figure 2 depicts the three main layers of the MapReduce stack The high-level language layer includes a variety of data manipulation languages and allows analysts to interface with the MapReduce programming model through the language of choice for example Pig Latin 27 is an SQL-lik e high-le v e l language that compiles automatically into MapReduce jobs The execution engine layer implements the MapReduce programming model and typically provides the automatic reliable efìcient use of computational resources Hadoop and Y ARN are opensource execution engines The storage engine layer provides similarly MapReduce-friendly services for data storage and possibly preservation the Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS is a storage engine The MapReduce stack is widely deployed and actively maintained Companies such as Hortonworks and Cloudera whose commercial platforms integrate all three layers of the MapReduce stack have provided thousands of updates to the open-source Apache Hadoop in the past ve years The MapReduce stack is typically deployed over a large distributed system e.g cluster grid cloud but middleware that can use resources from parallel supercomputers GPUs and exotic architectures is also under active development 624 


B Data Set Layout We design in this section a MapReduce-friendly data layout The raw tracker scrape data collected by BTWorld must be introduced into the storage engine ready for use by the execution engine The data layout design allows an implementation in several of the open-source storage engines e.g HDFS First in our design the raw tracker scrape data collected by BTWorld is decompressed and decoded prior to insertion into the storage engine This produces tab-separated plain text les one per tracker and sample The total size of the les ranges from a few kilobytes for niche trackers with only a few torrents to tens of gigabytes for the biggest trackers with millions of torrents The records in these les are represented by tuples with the following six elds  Hash H  a SHA-1 hash that uniquely identiìes the content transferred in BitTorrent Represented as a 40character string of hexadecimal digits  Tracker TR  an URL identifying the BitTorrent tracker  Timestamp TS  the time when the status information was logged Represented as a 11-character ISO 8601 basic format combined date and time representation  Seeders S  the number of seeders in the swarm at the moment when the sample is taken  Leechers L  the number of leechers in the swarm at the moment when the sample is taken  Downloads D  the number of downloads up to the moment when the sample is taken Second the les are inserted into the storage engine using a tracker-based directory structure Small scrape les for the same tracker and consecutive timestamps are concatenated to reduce the amount of internal fragmentation C Workîow of SQL-Like Queries We design the BTWorld queries as SQL-like queries integrated into the logical workîow Similarly to the data layout the SQL-like queries can be implemented using several tools from the MapReduce stack e.g the Pig Latin high-level language or even Hadoop through manual conversion into the MapReduce programming model The logical workîow includes several inter-query dependencies see Section I Figure 3 presents an overview of the full logical workîow for the BTWorld use case Each node represents an SQL-like query a query cannot start before the data outputted by each predecessor query in the workîow has been produced Table II summarizes the acronym and meaning of each query As the workîow diagram and the table indicate the queries are not one-to-one conversions of every individual analyst question Instead to increase performance we have designed our workîow to reuse results intermediary output data wherever possible We describe in the following four representative SQLlike queries of the logical workîow As we will show in Section IV-C they contain various inter-job and intra-job dependencies see Section I when implemented and exhibit various operational behavior when processing BTWorld data          Fig 3 The BTWorld logical workîow diagram A data dependency is a form of inter-query dependency TABLE II Queries of the logical workîow in BTWorld  Acronym Query Description ToT Tracker status over time SeT  SwT  SLT Sessions/Swarms/SeederLeecherRatio over time AT  AS  AH Active trackers/swarms/tracker per timestamp TKTL  TKTG Local/global top-K trackers TKHL  TKHG Local/global top-K hashes TKSL  TKSG Local/global top-K swarms TKNDH Newborn/Dead hashes over time for top-K trackers TrackerOverTime ToT  How does a tracker evolve in time We designed this query to monitor the status of a tracker in time with respect to the number of hashes the number of session the sum between the seeders and leechers and the ratio of seeders to leechers The query shown in pseudo-code in Listing 1 rst groups the input data set by the key=\(TR TS  and then applies different aggregation functions e.g count sum avg on the value=\(H S L D elds ActiveSwarms AS How many active hashes are in the system at every moment of time The output of the ToT query can be further used to extract the number of active swarms at any given time The query Listing 2 implements the same operators as the ToT query group and aggregate However the AS query runs on a much smaller dataset and is expected to have different performance characteristics ActiveHashes AH How many active hashes are in the Listing 1 Pseudo-code for the ToT query SELECT tracker timestamp COUNT hash AS hashcount SUM seeders  leechers AS sessions AVG leechers  0  seeders  seeders  leechers AS slratio FROM logs GROUP BY tracker timestamp Listing 2 Pseudo-code for the AS query SELECT timestamp SUM hashcount AS swarms FROM ToT GROUP BY timestamp 625

the level of the MapReduce jobs that implement each queries would obscure this difference For example the AH query is implemented automatically by the Pig system as a sequence of 2 MapReduce jobs whose runtimes are of about 2 500 s and 5 500 s A 2 500 s MapReduce job can also be observed as part of the set of jobs implementing the TKTG query We conclude that an analysis at the level of Pig queries can reveal interesting information which could be lost in a MapReducelevel analysis ToT  The ToT query is executed as a single map-heavy job Only 6.66 MB of data are selected from the 100 GB input in the map phase selectivity of about 1:6 000 The high selectivity can be attributed to the data set layout on HDFS The input data on HDFS is grouped by TR and sorted by TS  As a result grouping by TR TS means that for most keys all input records are processed in the same map task The map-side combiners can thus aggregate many records into one before they are shufîed and sent to the reducers AS/AT  The AS and AT queries are some of the small post-processing queries used to extract useful information for statistical analysis from the generic data sets produced by queries such as ToT  They present an additional challenge in optimization as the number of maps and reducers cannot be tuned without negative impact on performance For example using more than one reducer only increases the overhead of launching tasks and spreading data AH  As the pseudocode in Listing 3 suggests the AH query should ideally group the data set by timestamp and count the distinct hashes at every moment in time However a straight-forward implementation in Pig using the DISTINCT operator fails at runtime The DISTINCT operator within a grouping is executed by Pig in-memory in the reducers For large groups this results in an out-of-memory exception and ultimately failure to complete the query As a workaround we have manually selected the distinct hashes by selecting distinct H TS keys grouping the result by TS  and counting the number of hashes per group The resulting Pig query is split in two MapReduce jobs The rst job groups the data set by H TS pair and outputs all distinct pairs The second job groups the output of the rst by timestamp and utilizes combiners and reducers to count the number of hashes per timestamp Most of the time 90 is spent for this job in the mappers and combiners similar to the ToT job TKTG  The global TKT query translates to a variety of MapReduce jobs The query begins with three short jobs that create a list of the global top-K items and nishes with a large map-only job performing a join of this list and the full data set The latter job consumes most of the execution time for this query Due to the replicated join support of Pig the full list of top-K trackers is loaded into each of the mappers and the join is performed map-side For our chosen value of K the 100 GB input was reduced to 240 MB The performance of this query could be improved by choosing a MapReduce stack with support for indexes In the nal job of the global TKT query the full data set is read to extract all data for the top-K trackers With an index on the TABLE VI Types of MapReduce jobs their presence in the MapReduce workîow and SQL operator correspondence  Job Jobs in the SQL Operator Type MR Workîow Correspondence Map-only 5 Join projection Map-mostly 6 Map-side aggregation Map-reduce 6 Filtering Reduce-mostly 9 Reduce-side aggregation projection tracker eld only the data for the top-K trackers would have to be read from disk The tracker-based directory structure of our data on HDFS provides an opportunity to read only speciìc directories as input to retrieve the data of speciìc trackers D MapReduce-level Job Analysis We analyze in this section the MapReduce jobs generated by the Pig system from our BTWorld workîow implementation the results based on the run using the 100 GB data set are summarized in Figure 7 Overall we nd that the BTWorld use case results in MapReduce with diverse characteristics in line with previous characterizations of MapReduce workloads Similarly to the execution times observed for Pig queries Section IV-C the job execution times Figure 7\(a span several orders of magnitude However half of the jobs take less than 2 minutes which is consistent with the ndings of Chen et al 13 The MapReduce jobs exhibit various intra-job dependencies Considering the duration of each phase of the computation depicted in Figure 7\(b we distinguish the following types of dependencies and summarize their presence in the entire MapReduce workload in Table VI  Map-only  performing join operations between two partitions of the data set  Map-mostly  performing aggregations in the map-phase with combiners  Map-reduce  ltering the input data set extracting and emitting the useful information to the next job  Reduce-mostly  performing aggregations in the reducephase no map-side combiners We observe diverse I/O proìles for the MapReduce jobs in the BTWorld workîow The reduce phase is statistically more selective then the map phase rarely outputting more data than it receives as input Figure 7\(c Approximately 75 of jobs generate less intermediate data than the full size of the input data Figure 7\(d At the same time there are a number of jobs that produce signiìcantly more intermediary data up to 100 times the size of the input data which causes time-consuming I/O operations on the local le system V D ISCUSSION In this section we discuss the usefulness of the BTWorld use case We describe some of the lessons learned during the course of this study We discuss the performance results of our empirical evaluation of BTWorld implemented using a MapReduce stack Finally we introduce the idea of extending the

size and d the disk I/O bytes read and written between tasks normalized by input size The main lesson we have learned from implementing the BTWorld use case is that the process extends beyond a trivial conversion of the P2P analystês questions into queries that can be executed via a MapReduce stack The data set layout needed adjustments to t the storage layer When designing the queries performance improved by orders of magnitude by redesigning the Pig queries to re-use intermediary results across queries however this results in a more complex workîow and the need to make intermediary data persistent The design of SQL-like queries in Pig was hampered by the inability of Pig to run DISTINCT operators without failing see Section IV-C Tuning a MapReduce system for a particular type of job which is a common approach when the jobs perform very similar tasks may be difìcult for our use caseÑwe have shown in Section IV-D that our MapReduce jobs cover four broad distinct categories Although some adjustments we have made are speciìc to the chosen MapReduce stack e.g the DISTINCT operator failing in Pig we have also gained insight that is applicable for a variety of processing platforms that storing and re-using intermediary results may improve performance on many different platforms that complex big data workîows may be challenging for todayês data processing stacks etc With a throughput of just 2 MB/s see Section IV-B the achieved performance seems poor This can be partially attributed to the small cluster size relative to the data set size and also to the aged infrastructure of our testbed We expect to obtain better performance by upgrading the system to a larger cluster with more powerful nodes However several system-independent factors also contribute to the reduced performance the input data is processed in 7 different jobs multiple MapReduce jobs output gigabytes of data each and the chosen MapReduce stack does not include indexing in Section IV-C we discuss several queries for which indexes would greatly reduce the amount of data read and thus the achieved performance Modeling the performance of our usecase is non-trivial because the runtime of each MapReduce job depends on input data and executed algorithm and the MapReduce jobs are diverse in selectivity structure and data dependencies We have also learned that understanding the way groups of MapReduce jobs operate as single high-level Pig queries is also important in engineering performance To create an industry-wide benchmarking suite we have started and we currently lead within the SPEC organization 1 a joint community-wide effort on benchmarking time-based analytics platforms The use case presented in this work is a basic building block for such a benchmark including data structure and content and a full time-based analytics workîow However numerous challenges still need to be addressed deìning both full-data-set and incremental processing components deìning multiple workîows and possibly entire workloads creating realistic input generators devising metrics for various non-functional system properties e.g reliability elasticity energy-friendliness etc VI R ELATED W ORK We have already discussed two studies of MapReduce workloads from global-scale companies 13 W e surv e y in this section six MapReduce use cases and ve representative benchmarking suites In contrast with these approaches which are summarized in Table VII our BTWorld use case focuses on a new application domain system management computer science and combines exhibiting high workload diversity various types of dependencies and operational proìles with a large-volume data set Closest to our work MRBench  implements in MapReduce the queries included in the TPC-H database benchmark which are representative for decision support MRBench executes complex business oriented queries with concurrent data modiìcations on 3 GB of relational data BTWorld is considerably different in scope application domain data and workload Also close to our work the N-body Shop group analyzes massi v e amounts of data representing the astrophysics application domain The workload lters and correlates data at different moments of time using selection join and projection operators which target roughly 36 GB BTWorld exceeds the scope of N-Body Shop with a broader range of algorithms and a larger and more complex workîow Much of the remaining previous work focuses on matrix algorithms 7 web search 30 saturation tools with rather unrealistic workloads 17 scalable data generation from real workload traces and v arious indi vidual MapReduce applications 32 1 The Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation SPEC includes the SPEC Research Group RG which aims to foster the interaction between industry and academia in the eld We conduct work in the Cloud Working Group which is an SPEC RG branch that aims to develop the methodological aspects of cloud benchmarking including services for big data processing 629

able to automatically process large amounts of periodically collected data but currently only few use cases describe such workloads In this work we have introduced from a big data perspective BTWorld a big data use case representative for time-based analytics BTWorld aims at collecting processing and preserving large amounts of periodic measurement data representing the operation of the global BitTorrent network which accounts for a third of the global upstream trafìc in 2013 thus BTWorld enables novel big-data-driven research in computer science We have described the use case focusing on the BTWorld data set and on several research questions that BTWorld can answer We have designed for the MapReduce stack a logical workîow which includes a data layout and SQL-like queries that can answer the research questions efìciently The BTWorld workîow includes diverse queries and jobs which represent well three types of data dependencyÑinter-query inter-job and intra-job We have conducted an empirical study of the logical workîow implemented in the PigÖHadoop HDFS MapReduce stack and analyzed system-level performance and the performance of Pig Latin queries and their corresponding MapReduce jobs The BTWorld workîow exhibits challenging features three or more orders of magnitude differences in data sizes per observed item data selectivity and job duration We have further discussed the usefulness of the BTWorld use case including a path towards a benchmarking suite through the help of our SPEC Cloud WG partners A CKNOWLEDGMENT The rst author works through the Honours
