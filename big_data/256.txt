The foveal sensor provides observations of the target position corrupted by noise The sensor has two adjustable parameters d k sets the location of the foveal region while c k sets the gain at the center of the foveal region The observation for target t is obtained from its position as z k arctan  c k  X t k  d k    v t k  where v t k is white Gaussian noise with variance R  Once con  gured the foveal sensor provides measurements of target positions it detects each target with a known probability P D  The measurement vector at time k is z k   z 1 k z 2 k z M k k    Its elements consist of observed target positions and clutter We model clutter as uniformly distributed over the surveillance region volume V  the number of false alarms is Poisson distributed with parameter  V  where  is the spatial false alarm density and is known to the tracker III TRACKER ALGORITHM The nonlinearity of the foveal sensor observation model necessitates the use of a particle  lter in this application We use Monte Carlo joint probabilistic data association 5 an d an independent partition proposal distribution described in Section V to estimate the target state and provide information necessary to con  gure the foveal sensor The posterior distribution of x k given z 1 through z k is approximated by T max sets of N part particles  x i k  N part i 1 and associated weights   i k  N part i 1  Table 1 outlines our tracking algorithm IV SENSOR CONFIGURATION We improved the performance of the single-target con  guration rule in 1 by e x amining t he characteris tics of the near-optimal solution obtained using SPSA 7 f o r R  0  0  4  The foveal center d is positioned at the predicted target position The foveal gain c is set to c     P    1  8log 10 R   0  4  R  0  0146  3  30  P   0  R 0  0146 1 where P  is the predicted position error variance From this single target rule we have developed three foveal sensor con  guration rules for multi-target tracking SO is designed to observe all targets at the same time In order to let all targets fall within the high acuity foveal region d is set to the point midway between the two most widely separated targets say i and j  Denoting the distance between targets i and j as D ij  we set the gain as c  012     D ij 0  9  P  i  q P  j    log 10 R   0  4  R  0  0146   D ij 1  65  P  i  q P  j   0  R 0  0146 Ta bl e 1  Multiple Target Tracking Algorithm 1 Generate  x i 0  N part i 1 set   i 0  N part i 1  1 N part  2 Compute  x 0  015 N part i 1  i 0 x i 0 and  P 0  015 N part i 1  i 0  x i 0   x 0   x i 0   x 0  T  3 Set k 1  4 Compute the predicted state estimate  x  k  F  x k  1 and predicted error covariance P  k  F  P k  1 F   Q 5 Con  gure d k and c k as in Section IV 6 Obtain z k using the con  gured sensor 7 For each target t  propose a set of partitions  x t,i k  N part i 1 and associated bias terms  b t,i k  N part i 1 via the IP-GNN or IP-JPDA algorithm of Section V concatenate all partitions to form particles x i k   x 1 i k   x 2 i k   x T max i k     8 For i 1 N part   i k   i k  1 015 N H l 1 p  z k  l k  x i k   T max t 1 b t,i k  where   l k  N H l 1 is the set of feasible associations of observations to targets N H is the total number of feasible hypotheses and p  z k  l k  x i k  is given in   9 For i 1 N part  normalize weights  i k   i k 015 N part i 1  i k  10 Permute particles by the K-means algorithm[4  11 Compute the state estimate  x k  015 N part i 1  i k x i k  error covariance  P k  015 N part i 1  i k  x i k   x k   x i k   x k    12 Calculate  N ef f  1 P N p art i 1   i k  2 and perform resampling if  N ef f N T  13 Set k  k 1 andgotostep4 where P  i and P  j are the predicted position error variances of targets i and j  In TO the foveal region is centered on each target in turn while the gain is computed using 1 with P  of the centered target In WO the foveal region is centered on the target that has the largest predicted position error variance and the gain is also computed using 1 with P  of the centered target V INDEPENDENT PARTITION PROPOSALS The independent partition approach proposes a collection of particles for each partition  x t,i k   N part i 1  weights  w t,i k  N part i 1  which depend on the observation z k arecomV - 942

By terminating a node, we stop further processing at that node and no longer list any item sets under it. We exploit the following three pruning conditions   Z e r o c o n f i d e n c e  p r u n i n g   I f  t h e  c o n f i d e n c e  I  C     0   t h e n  t e r m i n a t e  n  Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence  ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE   O n e s u p p o r t  p r u n i n g   I f  t h e  s u p p o r t   I  C     1   then terminate n   M i n i m a l i t y  p r u n i n g   I f  t h e  c o n f i d e n c e   I  C    g t    minconf, then terminate n Zero-confidence pruning is a simple and straight forward pruning condition based on the observation that if the support of a certain item set, I, is zero then every superset of I has a zero support; as a result, any rule formed by replacing the antecedent of a rule having a zero confidence by a superset of that antecedent will also have a zero confidence. To justify t h a t    s u p p o s e  a  r u l e  I  C  h a s  a  s u p p o r t  o f  z e r o   i  e   s u p p o r t  I  U  C     0    a s  a  r e s u l t   t h e  c o n f i d e n c e  o f  I  C is also zero   r e c a l l  t h a t  c o n f i d e n c e  I  C     s u p p o r t  I  C     s u p p o r t  I    S u p p o s e  t h a t  I  is a superset of I; we know that support of \(I  U C I  U C I U C I   C   i s  z e r o  a n d  t h u s  c o n f i d e n c e  o f  I   C  i s  a l s o  z e r o   I n  s h o r t   i f  w e  k n o w  t h a t  a  r u l e  I   C  h a s  a  z e r o  confidence, then there is no need to process the supersets, I  of I and calculate the confidence values of the rules I   C  Rules with support equal to 1 are based on a single sample from the database and thus are not rules per se N o t e  t h a t  i f  t h e  s u p p o r t  o f  a n y  r u l e  I  C  i s  1   t h e n  a n y  non-minimal rule formed from this rule can not have a support greater than 1. In practice we can easily combine the previous two pruning conditions by pruning a node if its support is less than or equal to 1 this is because the confidence of a rule is equal to zero if and only if its support is equal to zero. Hereinafter we shall refer to those two pruning conditions combined as the support-less-than-two pruning The minimality pruning condition is based on our previous argument presented in section 2.3 for the need to remove non-minimal rules. Once we generate a rule R   I  C  w i t h  c o n f i d e n c e  v a l u e  e x c e e d i n g  m i n c o n f   w e  terminate the node, n, that generated R because all successor nodes of n may only generate non-minimal rules of R according to our definition of minimality As noted earlier, other pruning conditions that pertain to special situations can be easily added to our set of conditions and tested in a similar manner. Each pruning condition when satisfied results in node termination Our algorithm employs the two pruning conditions support-less-than-two pruning and minimality pruning to prune the SE tree. Every time we generate a new item set, I, at some node, n, three scenarios may transpire   S u p p o r t  o f   I  C   i s  l e s s  t h a n  2   w e  t e r m i n a t e  n   C o n f i d e n c e  o f   I  C   i s  i n  t h e  r a n g e   0   m i n c o n f  exclusively; we continue processing without terminating n   C o n f i d e n c e  o f   I  C   i s  g r e a t e r  o r  e q u a l  t o  m i n c o n f   w e  t e r m i n a t e  n  a n d  o u t p u t  I  C   a s  a  r u l e  The formal algorithm is depicted in Figure 2. Note 


that our algorithm is complete in terms of producing all confident minimal rules. We omit the proof due to space limitations Figure 2. The formal algorithm 4.2 Ensuring rule minimality Suppose we have a set of items {1, 2, 3  11} with 11 being the fixed consequent. Suppose further that we are currently working with node 1 and that to the right of 1 we have two un-terminated nodes, 9 and 8,9. Both nodes will be considered with 1 because node 8,9 falls under node 8 in the tree and is thus independent of the result of the join of 1 and 9.

In this scenario, our algorithm will not produce undesired rules but will test for rules whose outcome is known beforehand which undesirable because this involves the time-consuming process of scanning a large database to compute the support and confidence of the rule  in cases where a non-vertical database layout is adopted To rectify this problem, we associate a temporary taboo list \(TL the nodes that are pruned under I. For example, if 1  9  1 1  i s  n o t  a  c o n f i d e n t  r u l e  o r  i t s  s u p p o r t  i s  l e s s  than 2, then we append 9 to 1  s taboo list \(TL1 for short r u l e  u n d e r  n o d e  1   1  X  1 1   w e  c h e c k  i f  a n y  s u b s e t  o f  X is in TL1. If so, we directly terminate X under 1 and add X to TL1. This may seem unfeasible at first however, an efficient implementation has been devised 


as we shall discuss in more details in section 5.2 5. Implementation &amp; performance analysis 5.1.  The P-tree technology2 Our implementation for this work is based on an efficient data structure, the P-tree \(Predicate or Peano tree relational data in a loss-less compressed column-wise format by splitting each attribute into bits, grouping bits at each bit position, and representing each bit group by a P-tree. To create P-trees from transactional binary data, we store all bit values in each binary attribute for all the transactions separately. In other words, we group all bits, for all transactions t in the table, in each binary attribute, separately. Each such group of bits is called a bit group. Figure 3 shows the process of creating P-trees from a binary relational table. Part b groups, one for each attribute in a show the resulting P-trees, P1 and P2, one for each of the bit groups in b recursively partitioning the bit groups into halves Each P-tree will record the total number of 1s in the corresponding bit group on the root level. The second level in the tree gives the number of 1s in each of the halves of the bit group. The first node from the left on the second level will give the number of 1s in the first half of the bit group; similarly, the second node will give the number of 1s in the second half of the bit group. This logic is continued throughout the tree with each node recording the number of 1s in either the first or the second half \(depending on whether it is the left or right node 2 Patents are pending for the P-tree technology parent node. In practice, we do not directly store the number of 1s, but a 1 if the node contains only 1s and a 0 otherwise. Nodes containing only 1s or only 0s are considered pure \(otherwise they are mixed partitioned further  called pure-1 and pure-0 respectively. This aspect is referred to as P-tree compression [10] [16] and is one of the most important characteristics of the P-tree technology. Note that we can easily differentiate between pure-0 nodes and mixed nodes by the fact that pure-0 nodes have no children \(i.e. they are leaf nodes P1-trees corresponding to the P-trees in Figure 3 P1-trees are manipulated using operations such as AND, OR, NOT and ROOTCOUNT \(the count of the number of  1  s in the bit group represented by the tree in order to query the underlying data. The reader is referred to [10] [16] for more details on P-trees and their logical operators   Figure 3. Construction of basic P-trees Figure 4. Pure-1 Trees Note that by using P-trees, we can compute the confidence of rules in a quick and efficient manner without any database scans represented by a P-tree, Pi; to get the support of an item, we issue a ROOTCOUNT operation on the P-tree of that item. To get the support of an item set of size more than one, we AND the P-trees of the items in the a 0 00 0 1 1   0 0 01 0 1 b

For example, the node creation order for the set {1,2,3 would be: {1}, {2}, {1,2} ,{3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3 This ensures that every item set has all its subsets before it For every item, I, we maintain a TLI which saves the item sets whose outcomes, when joined with I, are known beforehand and thus need not be tested. In our implementation, each TLI is a P-tree having a size equal to the number of un-terminated nodes to the right of I \(i.e. all nodes that I will be tested with is used for nodes which, when joined with I, result in the firing of some pruning condition; thus, none of their supersets need to be tested with I. The remaining TLI entries will be 0s. For example, for the set of items 1,2,3,4}, suppose that the nodes created so far are 1}, {2}, {1,2} ,{3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. For node 4 we initialize a TL4 having 7 entries all containing 0s initially. If the joining of item 4 with node {2} results in firing at least one pruning condition, then the second entry pointing to item set {2} is flagged with 1, and so are all entries containing 2 \(i.e. entries pointing to 1,2}, {2,3} and {1,2,3 


1,2}, {2,3} and {1,2,3 tell which other entries contain item 2? We maintain for each item an index list as a P-tree \(called an index P-tree item exists in. For example, item 1 will have the following index list \(it will be stored as a P-tree but we are just listing the entries in a list for convenience 1,0,1,0,1,0,1. In other words, viewing the nodes of the SE tree in node creation order, item 1 occurs in node positions 1, 3, 5 and 7. Every new node added to the SE tree results in the expansion of all index P-trees by either a 1, if the corresponding item is in the new node added, or a 0, otherwise Going back to the previous scenario where the joining of item 4 with node {2} results in firing at least one pruning condition and thus node {2} need to be added to TL4, we simply OR the index P-tree of item 2 with TL4. In general, if we want to add node {x y  z} to some taboo list, TLI, we AND the index Ptrees for all items in the node \(i.e. AND index P-tree of x with that of y  with that of z us where item set {x, y  z} occurs. We then OR the resulting P-tree index with TLI which results in appending node {x, y  z} to TLI We maintain the taboo lists and index lists as Ptrees as this will give us faster logical operations and compression. In addition, in the case of taboo lists, it could speed the node traversal especially in cases where there many consecutive 1  s. For example suppose the entries in a taboo list are: 1111 0011 Figure 5 below shows the corresponding P-tree of the given taboo list Figure 5. The resulting taboo list in P-tree format In this example, instead of going through the first four nodes sequentially and then skipping them because they are flagged, using a P-tree to represent the taboo list, we can directly skip the first 4 entries because they form a pure-1 node on 2nd level of the Ptree It is worth mentioning that our traversal through the itemset space using taboo lists is very similar to a popular approach used in AI literature and known as Tabu search [13]. The idea in Tabu search is to traverse the space in a more effective manner by avoiding moves that result in revisiting points in the space previously visited whose outcome is known not to be acceptable \(hence the name "tabu   union of I and X produces an infrequent itemset implies that future joins of I with any superset of X will produce an infrequent itemset; a scenario similar in essence to revisiting a point in the search space whose outcome is known to be unsatisfactory and which could be circumvented by putting the point on a Tabu list. Because of the difference in context and problem definition, we refer to our lists as taboo lists instead of Tabu lists 5.3.  Comparison analysis To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has attempted to mine the type of rules we are considering We find [5] to be particularly interesting as it proposes an algorithm called Dense-Miner which is capable of mining association rules with fixed consequents at very low support thresholds. For the lack of a better benchmark, we will compare our approach with DenseMiner; however, we have to emphasize that a number 1                  0 0                    1 0 Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence  ICTAI 2004

Number of rules produced Figure 6 shows the time in seconds needed to mines rules at different confidence thresholds by our approach \(P-tree based aforementioned, Dense-Miner mines all rules using support pruning. It uses a variant of support referred to as coverage and defines the minimum coverage threshold as the minimum support divided by support of the fixed consequent. Results for Dense-Miner are observed with minimum coverage threshold fixed at 1% and 5%, respectively Our approach, on the other hand, mines only minimal rules without using any support pruning. It is very clear from the figure that users interested in minimal rules without support would prefer our approach as the time needed is many orders of magnitude less than that of Dense-Miner The user might notice from both parts of Figure 6 how the two approaches differ in the way they produce the rules. Dense-Miner takes more time at lower confidence while our approach takes more time at higher confidence thresholds. This is mainly because our approach mines minimal rules using only confidence pruning and the higher the confidence threshold, the more difficult it would be to get confident rules high in the SE tree; as a result, the SE tree grows deeper and thus requires more time to traverse. Dense-Miner, on the other hand, mines all Trans.

Figure 7 shows the number of rules produced by our approach over the two data sets at the 


produced by our approach over the two data sets at the different confidence thresholds. The same discussion presented in the previous paragraph applies here regarding the larger \(smaller produced at higher \(lower 6. Conclusion In this paper we proposed a framework based on SE-trees and the P-tree technology for extracting minimal, confident rules using fixed-consequent ARM Our methodology relieves the user from the burden of specifying a minimum support threshold by extracting the highest support rules that satisfy user confidence threshold. Albeit, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has attempted to mine minimal confident rules with fixed consequents, we provide a comparison analysis study showing how well we compare to other close approaches in the literature In terms of limitations, we acknowledge that our approach suffers in situations where the desired rules lie deep in the tree because a large number of nodes and levels need to be traversed then. A future direction in this area targets finding measures for estimating the probability of rule availability along certain branches and quitting early in cases where such probability is low 7.

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
