While systems exist for storing and managing sensor \ndata the real value of such data is the insight which can be \ngenerated from it. However there is currently no platform \nwhich enables sensor data to be taken from collection, through \nuse in models to produce useful data products.  The \narchitecture of such a platform is a current research question \nin the field of Big Data and Smart Cities. In this paper we \nexplore five key challenges in this field and provide a response \nthrough a sensor data platform “Concinnity” which can take \nsensor data from collection to final product via a data nrepository and workflow system. This will enable rapid \ndevelopment of applications built on sensor data using data \nfusion and the integration and composition of models to form \nnovel workflows. We summarize the key features of our \napproach, exploring how it enables value to be derived from \nsensor data efficiently nKeywords: sensor data management, sensor application, \nsensor platform, Digital City, Smart City. \nI INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION \nThe pervasive use of mobile and sensing devices enables \neveryone to collect data at any time, at any place. Sensor \ndata is certainly valuable to sensor owners for their own \nspecific purposes, but could also be valuable to a wider \naudience. The bottleneck now is not how to collect, store and nmanage the resulting Big Data itself, as various technologies \nexist to address these elements. Rather the challenge is how \nto build systems that enable us to effectively use such data. \nThis, in turn, requires us to revisit the key challenges in \ndesigning such systems. We note that in this paper we focus \nexclusively on the informatics challenges of big sensor data, \nupstream of the lower-level hardware or networking nconsiderations. \nA. Crowdsourcing and Collaboration  \n The first challenge relates to how we can create an eco-\nsystem where users get mutual benefit from data \ncontribution, sharing and usage. The current open data nimperative and big data wave force us to think beyond the \n‘owner-is-the-user’ model. Conversely, openness is not just a \ngoal in itself; there should be significant benefits for multiple \nactors from opening up data Similarly, there is an important \ndistinction to be made between single and multi-provider big \ndata Single-provider big data is usually curated and \nconsistent, whereas multi-provider big data suffers from lack nof structure and consistency. The sensor data that we \nconsider in this paper is open, multi-provider and big.  An \neffective sensor informatics platform for managing it must \nsupport and enable a collaborative framework that supports \noperations for sharing, annotating, reusing and analysing the \ndata itself. It must also enable sharing and documenting the \nresults and outputs of analysing such data with their \nprovenance i.e. tracking how they were developed in terms \nof data sources and analysis operations. \nB. Heterogeneity and Disparity  \nA second challenge relates to the disparity and \nheterogeneity of sensor data. Sensor-generated big data is \ntypically never under centralized control at a single location \nand is stored at distributed locations. Assuming that all data \nwill be eventually all uploaded in a central location is not \nrealistic. A more realistic assumption is that users can access \nand integrate parts of the data they need into their own data \nstorage, when they need it. The main challenge is that data \ncollected by different people under different regimes, and \nstored in different databases, is rarely stored in any standard \nformats. With such heterogeneous data, there is no universal \nway to retrieve and transform the data automatically and nuniversally into a unified data source for useful \nanalysis. Moreover, due to the heterogeneity in the nownership of sensor infrastructures, the data sets collected \nfrom sensors are not structured and documented in a way \nthat would make their combined use possible. An effective \nsensor informatics system for managing and using such data \nmust support tools that enable developers to query and \nintegrate heterogeneous data in disparate locations whilst \nlowering the complexity of dealing with its diversity. \nC. Multi-Resolution and Multi-Scale  \nThe third challenge relates to the fact that organizations, \nor individuals, deploying sensors to collect data typically \nhave different assumptions and intentions for what type of \ndata needs to be collected. They may use different types of \nsensors measuring different \(but related and irregularly distributed, geographical places. \nThe measurements are also typically collected at different nrates and time intervals. When data from such devices is \naggregated and/or integrated for use in a new application the \nuser is very quickly faced with its multi-resolution nature. \n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 94\nMoreover, users of the data will have their own conceptual \nmulti-scale levels of abstraction in their models. Taking an \nurban city as an example, city models often work at higher \nlevels of abstraction – such as a city wide, neighbourhood \nlevel or 


transportation model level. Further, such different \nlayers of abstraction frequently interact; building upon the \nresults of higher or lower levels to create further insight. An \neffective sensor informatics platform must provide features \nthat allow successfully supporting such multi-resolution and \nmulti-scale integrative analysis of the data. \nD. Data Uncertainty and Trustworthiness  \nThe fourth challenge relates to the inherent levels of \nuncertainty of the data itself.  Sensor data collected by third \nparties is supplied without centralized control. This data \ncould have been generated by sensors that are faulty, \nwrongly calibrated or beyond their life time.  There may \neven be measurements that have been maliciously tampered \nwith or intentionally supplied with erroneous information.  \nThe challenge also extends to the outputs of analysing nexisting data and reporting the results of the analysis back for \nuse by other users. The resulting data may also have multiple \nlevels of uncertainty/trust associated with it. An effective \nsensor informatics system must support users in assessing, \nmanaging and reasoning about the trustworthiness of the \ndata, results and their owners and how such trustworthiness \n\(or lack thereof Decision Making  \nThe fifth challenge relates to using the data itself in a \ncollaborative way to guide decision making processes. \nUltimately, the collected data needs to be subjected to \ndifferent forms analysis whether to find patterns or to \ndevelop new models to guide decisions. The quality of the \nanalysis, models and decisions all depend on the quality of \nthe input data itself. This includes uncertainty in \nmeasurements the resolution of the data and whether it \ncontains missing values. The analysis and modelling of the \ndata must be resilient to such factors. Moreover, the \nprocessing and analysis of large sensor data collections ninevitably translates into computational costs.  If real-time \ndecisions are needed and available resources are limited, \nusers are typically willing to compromise the quality of their \nmodels, e.g. by using less data or less computation. An \neffective sensor informatics platform must support an \nadaptive framework that fits the properties of the available \ndata and resources. \nThe five challenges discussed above motivate the work npresented in this paper. In Section II we review existing \nsensor data management systems and approaches. In Section \nIII and IV, we provide an overview of our new platform \ndesign and its key components. In Section V we present a \nnumber of application scenarios. In Section VI, we present \nour summary, discussion and future work. \nII. RELATED WORK / BACKGROUND \nSensor networks [1, 2] provide infrastructure through \nwhich we obtain data about the physical, engineered, and \nsocial systems by using sensing devices.  They have wide napplication in the areas of environmental monitoring, \nsecurity surveillance, mental training, city planning and \nhealth care. In a sensor network, individual sensors nodes \ncan be deployed in fixed locations or as mobile devices, or as \nad-hoc nodes that connect and disconnect from the network \ninfrequently. Each sensor collects measurements and sensors \nexchange information through wired or wireless \ncommunication channels using various network topologies \nand communication protocols. In such a network the nodes \nof the network can be connected together or alternatively all \nnodes can communicate directly only with a base station.  \nIn this paper, we make no assumptions about the \nnetworking protocols used to connect the sensor nodes. We \nalso make no distinction between who owns or operates the \nindividual sensor nodes. Our main focus is on the data ncollected by the different sensors and made available for \nsharing and collaboration. Such data needs to be stored and \nmanaged in a system that enables users to collaborate. We \ncategorize different sensor data management platforms by \ntheir support for such collaboration into three generations as \ndescribed below. We then describe briefly the WikiSensing \nsystem used as the backend for our own current research. \nA. First Generation \nAlthough many sensor network systems are designed for \nuse by many users in different applications, the first \ngeneration data management systems focused simply on \nstoring and querying the sensor data. Examples include \nAurora and Cougar [3] [4] which process incoming data \nstreams for   applications Such systems provide query \nalgebra containing several primitive operations for \nexpressing queries over the streams and/or querying the \nsensor nodes in a distributed way. Such systems had no clear \nnotion of enabling or supporting collaboration between users \nof the same set of sensors. \nB. Second Generation \nThe second generation data management systems \nprovided different primitives to support collaboration \nbetween users of sensor networks. Such systems enabled \neither configuring the collection and/or the processing of \ndata in a collaborative way between different users. For \nexample, the Discovery Net system [6] provides an example nwhere different users could develop their own data collection \nworkflows specifying how sensor data can be processed \nbefore storing in a centralized data warehouse. It also \nenabled them to develop analysis workflows for integrating \nthe data with data collected from other data sources. Users of \nthe system could thus share the same data and also derive \nnew views and analysis results that were also shared. \nAnother example is the CitiSense [5, 7] project which \ndeployed a system allowing users to provide feedback on \npollutants by the general public using mobile devices. By \nenabling this, the system supports enriching the information \nby the 


users and also allows them to comment on the \noperation and trustworthiness of the sensors. Each of the nsystems in this category supports a limited form of \ncollaboration while operating on a fixed set of sensors n95\nC. Third Generation \nThe third generation data management systems for is \nbased on open systems where users can collaboratively \nsubmit data from any sensor and where other users can use \nsuch data. One example of this generation is Xively [8] \n\(formally known as both Pachube and then Cosm their sensor data and allows them to \ncollaboratively build applications based on such data. The \nsystem follows a passive approach to the control of sensors \nby the collaborators. However, it simplifies online ncollaboration between them by allowing them to submit \ndiverse data sets ranging from individual energy and nenvironment data to data collected from transport services. \nMoreover, it allows developers to embed real-time graphs & \nwidgets in websites; analyse and process historical data, and \nsend real-time alerts to control devices. \nAnother example of the third generation systems is the \nWikiSensing System \(wikisensing.org 9] which is used in \nour research presented in this paper. It provides a web-\naccessible online database services allowing sensor \nowners to register and connect their devices to feed data into \nthe system for storage. It also allows developers to connect \nto the database and build their own applications based on that ndata and perform different forms of analysis. Moreover,  it  \nprovides support for adding and annotating information \nabout the sensors and their data through a wiki approach.  \nD. Other systems \nVarious other research efforts have been conducted on \nsensor data fusion [10-13]. However, most efforts do not \naddress the design of a public and generic platform to fuse \nthe sensor data, especially for large scale, multisource data. \nSimilarly, although there are significant research efforts on \nbuilding analysis models for sensor applications [14] [15-\n18], most work builds on certain assumptions on the data \ndistributions and few of these work are organized in a \nframework or toolkit for sensor data analyses or application \ndevelopers to use. Similarly, work has been done on model \ncomposition [19], which becomes a critical component of \nour platform, and some workflow systems for model \ncombination were created [6, 20, 21], but none of these nefforts addresses designing a generic analysis platform for \nsensor data and modelling.  It is worth noting that there are \nseveral sensor data marketplaces [22-24] where users and \ndevelopers can query and purchase the data from these data \nmarketplaces and then build their application by \nthemselves. However, there is no platform to support users in \nturning such data into applications.  \nIII. CONCINNITY PLATFORM OVERVIEW \nWhile WikiSensing provides many collaboration features \nthat support addressing the crowdsourcing and collaboration nchallenges of sensor informatics, it does not address the other \nchallenges identified in Section 1. In order to fully leverage \nthe value of data collected by sensor network systems, more \nwork needs to be done in improving how we can manage \ndata collected from various sources in a collaborative way, \nespecially in terms of data collection, fusion and analysis. \nOur motivation here is to investigate how we can build on \ntop of WikiSensing a novel WikiModelling platform so as to \nprovide a comprehensive solution “Concinnity” that can naddress the other challenges. \nFig. 1 illustrates the Concinnity architecture for \naddressing the challenges In the remainder of this section we \ndescribe the components and how their interaction provides a \nsolution for building a generic Platform-as-a-Service \(PaaS AppEditor \nThe application development environment, “AppEditor”, \nsupports developers in constructing sensor data applications.  \nIt allows them to retrieve sensor data from various sources \nusing a declarative query language, and to review the sensor \ndata at multi-scale and multi-resolution levels using a range \nof visualisation tools, including category-based hierarchical \nstructure and location-based exploration. Users can apply \nfilters to such data and then composite it with analytical \nmodels using idea similar to the mashup editor [25] as \nworkflows and finally publish their sensor data application. \nThe AppEditor also provides a collaborative environment to \naccess hierarchical catalogue of existing data sets, models \nand analysis workflows that have been contributed by \ndifferent developers. Such workflows will be executed using \nthe workflow engine.  \nB. WikiModelling – Workflow Engine \nWorkflow definitions from the AppEditor are passed to a nworkflow engine workflow engine to retrieve data from \ndifferent sources and to filter it or fuse it as required and to \ntransform the data into formats suitable for input to analytic \nmodels. , We base our implementation on an extension of the \n“HierSynth” [19] engine enables the creation of a \nhierarchical representation of the conceptual multi-scale or \nFigure 1. Concinnity Platform overview,  next generation systems will \nrequire collaborative sensor data storage together with a space to analyse \ndata and a collaborative interface for creating workflows for this purpose. \n96\nFigure 2. Concinnity Platform architecture, combinding the WikiModelling and WikiSensing Systems  \nmulti-resolution environment under study within the \nworkflow graph itself. For example, a geographical \ndecomposition of the city into suburbs and districts, e.g. \nbased on standard urban ontologies by the Open Geospatial \nConsortium, enables the 


composition of data and models to \nbe achieved at each level of the city and provides an \neffective communication paradigm for cross-scale \nmodelling. The workflow engine also provides the context of \nhow model integration can be achieved. It supports a wide \nvariety of input and output data sources including nwikisensing.org and requires that every model or data fusion \nmodule to register its list of inputs and outputs to the engine. \nThese requirements can then be used to verify all data \nrequired for integration are available when the workflow is \ncreated. A plug-in architecture supports multiple methods for \nachieving data fusion and resolving concerns with \nuncertainty. The engine supports multiple users and \nscenarios by default each with their own library of \nconfigured data sources models, and workflows. To support \ncollaboration the engine enables the publication of \nworkflows as new public API’s upon the platform. This \nprovides a concept of “workflows of workflows” supporting \nthe creation of an ecosystem of useful techniques to be \ncomposed in a collaborative fashion. \nC. WikiSensing \nThe WikiModelling system builds upon the WikiSensing \nrepository as a sensor data storage solution. WikiSensing’s \noriginal design simplifies addressing the heterogeneity and ndisparity challenge in two ways. Firstly, its schema-less \nstorage architecture based on mongoDB decouples the \nstorage layer from the data schema, enabling storage layer \nflexibility. Secondly, it offers data stream aggregation \nabstraction via the concept of ‘virtual sensors’. By using this \nfunctionality users can create their virtual sensors using \ncustom aggregation functions. To address the multi-\nresolution and multi-scale challenge, WikiSensing is \nextended in this work to support ontology definitions, thus \noffering the capability of ontology-based querying over the \ndata using user-defined ontologies suitable to the level of ndetail that each application demands by this over time, \ngeography or a conceptual resolution. Moreover, to address \nthe data trustworthiness challenge, we extend it by \nincorporating various anomaly detection tools within the \nsystem and also by extending the sensor metadata model to \ncapture trustworthiness information explicitly. \nIV. DETAILED DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION \nFig. 2 shows our detailed design of the Concinnity nplatform. This consists of the WikiSensing data store and the \nWikiModelling workflow engine and application editor.  \nWikiSensing provides capabilities for data storage and \nmanagement, while the WikiModelling system support \napplication design and execution environment. In the \nfollowing section, we will discuss each component of our \nplatform in detail. \nA. WikiModelling - AppEditor \nThe AppEditor is an online development environment, \nwhich provides a graphical user interface to integrate data \nfrom different sensors, apply analytic models, construct \nworkflows, publishing the final service as a sensor \napplication. As shown in Fig 2, it comprises several \nmodules as described below. \nData/Models Explorer: Developers can visually discover nand browse available sensor data as well as analytic models \nin our platform before constructing their applications. In this \nmodule the AppEditor integrates available sensor data on the \nmap as shown in Fig. 3 It also retrieves lists of models \nprovided by the WikiModelling system. When there are no \n97\nsensors in a particular location, we create “virtual sensors” \n[9] by making a probabilistic estimation \(along with the nuncertainty of the estimation e.g. pollutant \nconcentration contain sensors, but \nhave a sufficient number of nearby “contributing” sensors as \nshown in Fig. 4. \n \nFigure 3. Structured visual exploration of sensor data. \n \nFigure 4. Virtual sensor composed from local physical sensors.  \nWorkflow Editor: This module provides an efficient tool \nto assist developers to build data applications. Fig. 5 shows \nthe workflow editor in AppEditor, which is a graph-like \nenvironment where developers can couple available elements \nas shown in Table 1. The elements and links between them, \nincluding data and models which are listed in the tree \nstructure by categories, can be added into design diagram by ndrag-and-drop.  \nThe settings of each element, like the parameters for a \nmodel and data connection string of one data source, are \nedited directly in the property window. After the developers \ncreate an application in the editor, a corresponding execution \nscript in xml format will be generated. The script includes \nthe detail information of each element and the relations \nbetween them. It can be delivered to the workflow engine via nAPIs and stored to the repository. \nTask Scheduler: Once the developers have completed the \ndesign of their sensor application workflows, they may \ncontrol the execution process of the application through task nscheduler. The developers can run, stop, pause or check the \nstatus of their applications running via the APIs provided by \nWikiModelling. \nResult Viewer: The Results Viewer allows users to view \nthe results of executing their workflow using various \nvisualization tools.  \nService Publisher: Developers can finally publish the \napplication as a web service, and list it in our platform \(as \nshown in Fig. 6 functions like rating and \ncomments are also provided. Such a repository will benefit \nfrom network effects. \n nFigure 5. AppEditor: two available data sources - Nitrogen oxide and \nSulphur dioxide, are selected and filtered with geographical query \(in  \n“SW7” area index. \nTABLE I.  AVAILABLE ELEMENTS IN THE APPLICATION EDITOR \nElement \n\(shape

The system has a model \nrepository and runtime environment where users \ncan contribute their own models nConnector \n\(triangle n\(square WikiModelling - Workflow Engine \nUnderpinning the WikiModelling editor is a workflow \nengine based upon the extension of the HierSynth [19] \nengine originally developed to target the Architectural \nEngineering and Construction \(AEC e.g. buildings in a development or floors and \nrooms in a building nper element analysis on multiple scales. Hence the engine \nprovides features which re-conceptualize the workflow graph \nto reflect the structure of the design. \nThe engine supports several interesting features that are \nsuitable for sensor data management. Most notably it enables \nthe workflow graph to reflect a hierarchical decomposition of \nthe design; for example breaking down the city by suburb, \n98\ndistrict and building to address the multi-scale/resolution \nchallenge. This is achieved by incorporating queries and ntemplates into the workflow graph. On expansion of the \nquery the template is instantiated for every result This \nexpanded structure can then be annotated with analysis at \nevery level of the design decomposition. This enables simple \nscaling of analysis on multiple scales and enables simple \nmulti-scale model integration based upon the design \ndecomposition structure. This feature is useful for sensor \nanalysis of large urban areas allowing fine grained per sensor \nanalysis to be combined with local area and city scale \nanalytics in a clearly defined way. Such multi-resolution \ninformation can be extracted from WikiSensing, potentially \nusing Virtual Sensors’. \nFig. 7 shows an example of this hierarchical design \ndecomposition, with building level analyses and connections \nto building level sensors used within the analyses. Analysis \nat higher scales can access the results of those at lower scales \nvia “execution links” defined by the user. These relate two nnodes \(a, b b must finish \nexecuting before the original node \(a wide analysis to a district \nnode will not execute until all analyses within the district \nhave executed allowing the high level analysis to use the \nresults of the low level analysis. \n \nFigure 6. An example of sensor application description. \nEach workflow is executed for a number of scenarios. \nThese scenarios contain configuration, design and sensor \ndata and are provided as inputs to the RESTful API service \nwhen the workflow is published using the workflow \nscheduler. These enable the same workflow to be used for nconsidering multiple future scenarios, locations or possible \ninterventions. Examples include different climates or \ndifferent cities. This helps to address the challenge of \ndecision making.  Scenarios flow through the workflow \ngraph between nodes, being updated by each node and \nbranching at forks in the graph This branching enables the \nscenario to be specialized to particular elements of the \ndecomposition \(e.g. a particular location or building data or sensor data.  \nThis data model provides simple aggregation of results to \nthe various levels considered in the decomposition; simply \nby averaging or summing all child nodes in the hierarchy. \nThis enables rapid production of summary statistics for a \nhigh-level overview of sensor or simulation data. The nhierarchy then provides rapid localization of anomalies or \nfaults and allows management of large quantities of sensor \ndata across a range of geographical scales. The \nWikiModelling engine provides a plug-in architecture to \nsupport extension of the nodes available to create workflows \nwith. Nodes are of four types n• Template – these store data about entities within the \ndesign or the area under study.  \n• Query – these are data sources for example \nconnections to the wikisensing.org platform.  \n• Analysis – these are either machine learning \nmodules or more traditional models – for example an \nagent based model for traffic simulation.  \n• Logical – these nodes affect how the workflow is \nexecuted, for example forking a branch of the \nworkflow or optionally execution only a part of the \nworkflow.  \n \nFigure 7. An example HierSynth workflow hierarchy. \nThe analysis nodes can operate in a variety of \nenvironments and locations. These will vary from Hadoop-\nscale big data processing tasks to single spreadsheet based \nmodels being run on the local server through to a traffic \nsimulation running on a remote platform. This variety in \nanalyses and locations of execution is critical to supporting \nthis platform [26] as it enables each stakeholder to retain \ncontrol of their IP and infrastructure by providing a service \nwhich the WikiModelling system can interact with to nexecute nodes in a workflow graph. \nAlongside these nodes a number of services are provided \nby the platform to generate insight via workflow and models. \nThese include scenario generation and sensitivity analysis of 


nworkflows and models. These services can be invoked via \nthe API and produce large ensembles of scenarios under \nwhich the workflow is to be run. The workflow engine \nprovides a full caching engine to avoid re-computation of \ncostly analyses as well as an analysis management engine to \nmanage contention for execution resources from processing \n99\ntime, memory or licensing and concurrent request limitations \non external API’s.  \nPortions of workflows together with configured nodes \nmay be shared with other users via a data and model \nrepository which will promote reuse of data and expertise. \nThis could form the basis of a marketplace for model and \ndata expertise. Together these capabilities lead onto the idea \nof connecting multiple workflows together. For example \nusing one to carry out prediction on a set of temperature \nsensors to identify future trends; then secondly identifying \nthe likely implications for energy demand. This can be nachieved by extracting scenarios from the computed analysis \nworkflows which can then be entered into the subsequent \nenergy demand prediction workflow; such chaining of \nworkflows enables design space exploration 19]. \nC. WikiSensing Datastore \nWikiSensing is an online collaborative sensor data \nmanagement system is based on a three-tiered architecture \n\(Fig. 2 interface for sensor data management and a Wiki based \nfront end for sharing of knowledge and information. The ndatabase tier hosts the databases for the sensor and the wiki \ndata. The application layer contains the business logic for the \nservices, controlling user access, managing the data and \nsupporting online collaborations. The application layer \ndirectly interacts with the database via the data access \nmodule. This forms the foundation for the WikiModelling \nsubsystem of our architecture. \nData Management: The data management module \nsupports querying, setting up triggers on data streams and \nvalidating and verifying the data that will be stored in the \nsystem. This further contains logic to optimize querying in \norder to enhance the performance of aggregation operations \nand creating ‘Virtual Sensors’. The main forms of querying \ncan be categorized into regular queries that select sensor \ndetails such as sensor readings and its deployment ninformation and aggregation queries that combine several \ndata streams. The system also supports continuous queries \nthat provide readings to the users uninterruptedly within a \nspecified time period. Triggers are mainly used to inform \nusers when a certain threshold has been reached on a \nparticular data stream. This is useful to provide alert in the \ncase of abnormal or unusual behaviours of sensor readings. \nThe optimizer module focuses on increasing the efficiency of \nthe aggregate queries which is considered as one of the most ncommon operations in sensor data management [27]. It is \nresponsible for analysing the information that contains the \ndata streams that constitute the virtual sensors and \nidentifying the most efficient \(with minimal amount of \ndatabase reads sensor readings in a cached \nrepository for quick access. The API web services exposes \nthe functionalities of WikiSensing in order to be used from \ndifferent programming platforms. The web service provides \nfunctionality for users to connect to the WikiSensing \nmiddleware using different technological platforms. The \nontology engine component manages and queries the \nontology via an API that supports SPARQL [25]. The \nontology is stored as graphs in a RDF Quad store database. \nWikiSensing stores live stream data as well as the history of nthe stream by associating sensor readings with a timestamp. \nThe analysis of this data can either be done on the historical \ndata or the live data. The former is executed in a passive \nnature while the latter polls for any new data.  \nData Trustworthiness Management: In order to simplify \ntrustworthiness assessment, we extended WikiSensing with \ncapabilities for calculating trustworthiness scores on \navailable data. These scores are based on anomaly detection \ntechniques that identify if a sensor is reporting conflicting \ninformation with its neighbouring sensors, with historical \ntrends or if it violates minimum and maximum values known \nfrom its context. Different data visualization tools are \nprovided to simplify detecting such conflicts when they noccur. Moreover, users are provided with the opportunity to \nassign their own rating for the sensor or measurement \ntrustworthiness. \nV. CASE STUDIES  \nWe have constructed an initial prototype of our \nConcinnity platform through the integration of the different \ncomponents described in the previous section. In this section \nwe describe three case studies which are helping us show the \nproof of concept of our platform and also to elaborate \nchallenges we outlined earlier and to provide use case \nscenarios. \nA. Assessing Data Trustworthiness  \nWe address the challenge of data trustworthiness of \nBigData mentioned in section \(I, D introducing a set of \nfeatures that are capable of assessing trust. Here we describe \na practical deployment of our system first, with the intention \nof exploring the data manipulation and trustworthiness \nassessment capabilities of WikiSensing. \nWikiSensing was used as one of the data stores that \nsupported the Hackathon event at the Urban Prototyping \nLondon \(UP London WikiSensing hosted MetOffice temperature and \nwind speed data \(two weeks and traffic disruptions data two weeks 


three \nyears concurrent users and \ndeployed back-up cloud infrastructure on Windows Azure \n[29].  \nSecondly we explored the trustworthiness of sensor data \nat UP London’s Crackathon competition on 22 April 2013 \nFigure 8. Data trustworthiness heat map to detect anomalies.\n100\nwhere WikiSensing’s data trustworthiness API was first ntested with external users. For the Crackathon, contestants \nwere given air pollution data of four types from 140 sensors \nat an area in East London, which had been selectively altered \nto simulate different potential attacks on the data. The task \nwas to assign a trustworthiness score to measurements of \ndifferent sensors at different times, with the aid of \nWikiSensing’s trustworthiness API which offered history-\nbased and neighbour-based abnormal reading detection. Fig. \n8 shows one visual anomaly detection tool used.  \nB Electric Car Vehicles \nIn the context of the city understanding the future impact \nof electric vehicles upon the electrical grid is key to the \nresilience of the city’s infrastructure.  To address this \nresearchers in London’s Digital City Exchange have \nproposed a collaborative approach [26] to modelling the \nimpact of electric vehicle charging upon the electricity \ngrid.  This approach brings together experts in transportation nstudies with those studying the electrical grid. In a nutshell \nan agent based transportation model will be used to simulate \nexpected journeys within the cities. This journey information \nwill then be translated into the state of charge of a collection \nof electric vehicles together with their locations through the \nday \(the opportunities to charge them electricity \ngrid based upon a variety of charging and pricing strategies. \nConcinnity will support this analysis by enabling the \ncollaboration on a single platform by aiding the integration \nof models and data together using the WikiModelling system. \nThis workflow will be driven using data from a range of \nsources including National Statistics and maps and electricity \ngrid statistics. These must each be aggregated to the correct \nlevel of the multi-scale representation at which the workflow \nis being run, using a hierarchical workflow similar to Fig. 7. \nThis will enable running the simulation at different scales, \nperhaps with a city-wide transpiration simulation being used \nby district and substation level electricity grid simulations nThere is the potential to extend this case study to deal with \nsensor data collected from current electric vehicle owners as \nto their typical journeys, state of charge and charging times. \nHowever this will necessitate complex data fusion from \ncrowd-sourced data which will have inherent uncertainty. \nAddressing these challenges remains an integral goal of our \nsystem to enable this case-study on our platform. \nC. Health and Medical Applications \nCurrent smart phones have many embedded sensors \nranging from microphones to gyroscopes and proximity \nsensors. Similarly, new generations of professional wearable \nmedical sensors can now connect to smart phones and \ntransfer sensing results directly about person’s health; \nincluding blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood glucose \nlevel, Electrocardiogram \(ECG EEG electro-cardiography \(EKG this data.  This has created \nheterogeneity and disparity challenges, making it difficult for \nusers to reclaim back their data, manage or remix it in their \npreferred ways. From the provider’s point of view, such nmassive growth of these big health sensor data creates both \ndata manageability and collaboration challenges nConcinnity also has applications beyond traditional \ndigital cities and can provide a basis for applications in \nhealthcare as well as in medical research. The platform \nallows individuals to contribute data about their lifestyles \nand well-being via smartphones, tablets and wearable \ndevices. The platform made the collected data available for \nsharing and collaboration. It also enables such crowd-\nsourced data to be analysed in various ways by composing \ndifferent models and workflows in AppEditor.  \nTo explore such applications, we have also prototyped an \napplication for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance \nimaging \(fMRI controlled stimulus, fMRI collects a \nsequence of brain images in order to localize brain activities \nthat rely on neuron activity across the brain or in a specific \nregion. The detected activities are very useful to plan for \nsurgery and radiation therapy of the brain [28]. fMRI \ntechniques have inherent limitations, such as limited number \nof sensor data and noises \(e.g. thermal noise, system noise, \nand physiological noise Therefore, the big challenge of \nfMRI technique is to accurately localize the brain activities \nwith high spatial and temporal resolution signals generated \nfrom a low resolution and noise sensor data. In this case nstudy we will show our first attempts to apply our platform’s \nconcepts in this domain, using fMRI measurements.   \nWe use Concinnity to construct a complex  functional \nMR images analysis workflow as Fig. 9 which consists of \nthree stages: fMRI reconstruction \(reconstruct high \nresolution fMRI signal from a limited number of sensor data remove uncertainty of  the signal activities detection these for different analysis purposes. In \naddition, the platform allows users to store and share their \nraw 


data and analysis results. This helps other users to \nevaluate the analysis in a collaborative way and eventually \nget more accurate and comprehensive output signal. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  \nA foundational challenge in the smart city is that \ncollaboration in the use of city data is fragmented with no ncommon coherent structure. This precludes many benefits \nwe might glean from our growing and increasingly digital \ncities. Without a new generation of sensor data management \nFigure 9. A functional MRI data analysis design diagram in AppEditor. \n101\nplatforms as explored in this paper the adoption and benefits \nof the smart city will be substantially reduced. Particularly as \nchallenges in collaboration and data heterogeneity breed an \nincreasingly fragmented patchwork of systems and data \nunable to exploit the benefits of multi-resolution and multi-\nscale data analysis compounded by the inherent disparity of \ndata, its uncertainty and potential untrustworthiness.  \nCreating this new generation of sensor data management \nplatforms has many benefits, most notably in network effects \nenabled by collaboration. Citizens will gain new real-time \nservices allowing more informed decision making, this leads \nto optimisation and greater efficiency in the use of city \nservices; a key goal of city authorities. This is enabled by \ndevelopers utilising the platform to combine data and models nin novel ways; providing value to data providers via new \nmonetisation streams.  \nThe Concinnity system addresses the five identified \nchallenges via its sub-systems. For example the \nwikisensing.org data platform aids crowdsourcing of data \nwhilst collating metadata to deal with its disparity and \nproviding tools to assess its trustworthiness. Similarly the \nworkflow system is designed to address the multi-scale \nchallenges whilst allowing integrated consumption of data to \naid model based decision making. This is supported by a ncollaborative workflow editing system.  \nTo validate the Concinnity platform we have proposed \nthree case studies utilising different aspects of the system to \nrespond to the challenges facing the next generation of nsensor data management platforms. At present this \narchitecture is being implemented by integrating and resting \nthe components described in Figure 1. Once completed the \nauthors look forward to reporting the lessons learned from \nthese case studies. This will provide a platform for further \nresearch for supporting wider multidisciplinary studies in the \ncontext of the realization of the smart city concept and serve \nas a digital exchange framework. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe would like to acknowledge research funding received \nfrom the EPSRC through Research Grant EP/H042512/1, \n“Elastic Sensor Networks: Towards Attention-Based \nInformation Management in Large-Scale Sensor Networks”, \nand Research Grant EP/I038837/1, “Digital City Exchange nREFERENCES \n[1] Akyildiz, Ian F., Weilian Su, Yogesh Sankarasubramaniam, and Erdal \nCayirci.

By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
