In this work, we provide fast incremental al-\ngorithms for closeness centrality computation. Our algorithms\nef?ciently compute the closeness centrality values upon changes\nin network topology, i.e., edge insertions and deletions.

INTRODUCTION\nCentrality metrics, such as closeness or betweenness,\nquantify how central a node is in a network. They have\nbeen successfully used to carry analysis for various purposes\nsuch as structural analysis of knowledge networks 14, 18],\npower grid contingency analysis [7], quantifying importance\nin social networks [12], analysis of covert networks [9], and\neven for ?nding the best store locations in cities [15]. Several\nworks on rapid computation of these metrics exist in the lit-\nerature. The algorithm with the best time complexity to com-\npute centrality metrics [2] is believed to be asymptotically\noptimal [8]. Research have focused on either approximation\nalgorithms for computing centrality metrics [3, 4, 13] or\non high performance computing techniques [11, 19]. Today,\nthe networks one needs to analyze can be quite large and\ndynamic, and better analysis techniques are always required.\nIn a dynamic and streaming network, ensuring the correct-\nness of the centralities is a challenging task [5, 10]. Further-\nmore, for some applications involving a static network such\nas the contingency analysis of power grids and robustness\nevaluation of networks, to be prepared and take proactive\nmeasures, we need to know how the centrality values change\nwhen the network topology is modi?ed by an adversary or\nouter effects such as natural disasters. As Figure 1 shows,\nthe effect of a local topology modi?cation is usually global.\nTo quantify these effects and ?nd exact centrality scores,\nexisting algorithms are not ef?cient enough to be used\nin practice. Novel, incremental algorithms are essential to\nquickly evaluate the effects of topology modi?cations on\ncentrality values.\n n\n n\n n\n n\n n\n\n   \n\t\n\b\n\n\n\b\f\n\n\n\f n \n \n\b \t\nFigure 1.

BACKGROUND\nLet G = \(V,E modeled as a simple graph\nwith n = |V | vertices and m = |E| edges where each node\nis represented by a vertex in V , and a node-node interaction\nis represented by an edge in E. Let ?G\(v connected to v.\nA graph G? = \(V ?, E vertices such that\nthere exists an edge between each consecutive vertex\npair. A path between two vertices s and t is denoted by\ns  t \(or s P t if a speci?c path P with endpoints s and\nt is mentioned v ? V are connected if\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 487\nthere is a path between u and v. If all vertex pairs in G\nare connected we say that G is connected Otherwise, it is\ndisconnected and each maximal connected subgraph of G\nis a connected component, or a component, of G. We use\ndG\(u, v graph G. If u = v then dG\(u, v u, v V,E a vertex v ? V is called an\narticulation vertex if the graph G?v \(obtained by removing\nv 


components than G. Similarly, an\nedge e ? E is called a bridge if G?e \(obtained by removing\ne from E connected components than G. G is\nbiconnected if it is connected and it does not contain an\narticulation vertex. A maximal biconnected subgraph of G\nis a biconnected component.\nA. Closeness Centrality\nGiven a graph G, the farness of a vertex u is de?ned as\nfar[u] =\n?\nv?V\ndG\(u,v u, v u is de?ned as\ncc[u] =\n1\nfar[u]\n. \(1  unweighted graph G = \(V,E n\(m + n  Algorithm 1 executes a Single-Source\nShortest Paths \(SSSP BFS from s, computes the distances to the other\nvertices and far[s], the sum of the distances which are\ndifferent than ?. As the last step, it computes cc[s]. Since\na BFS takes O\(m + n in\ntotal, the complexity follows.\nAlgorithm 1: CC: Basic centrality computation\nData: G = \(V,E cc[.]\n1 for each s ?

The diameters of\nthese networks grow proportional to the logarithm of the\nnumber of nodes. That is, even with hundreds of millions\nof vertices, the diameter is small and when the graph\nis modi?ed with minor updates, it tends to stay small.\nCombining this with the power-law degree distribution of\nscale-free networks, we obtain the spike-shaped shortest-\ndistance distribution as shown in Figure 2. We use work\n?ltering with level differences and utilization of special\nvertices to exploit these observations and reduce the\ncentrality computation time. In addition, we apply SSSP\nhybridization to speedup each SSSP computation.\n\n 


than necessary. Conversion to greyscale also \nallows for a more straight-forward implementation of the nimage-processing techniques that follow. The next step in \nthe process deals with the pixel-wise subtraction between \nthe two images. Since the direction and orientation of the \ntwo cameras is similar and the range to the background is \neffectively infinite, the pixel-difference operation should \neliminate most data in the background of the image while \nextracting information in the image foreground. This is due \nto the parallax effect, in which objects further away from an \nimager appear to move slower as projected across the focal nplane array when compared with objects that are closer to \nthe imager.  \nThe resultant of the pixel-difference operation is a single \nimage containing little background data and two foreground \nobjects In order to further separate the objects from the \nbackground, contrast enhancement is performed on the \nimage and it is then subjected to an empirically defined \nthreshold for conversion to a binary image. The nmorphological image processing operators of erosion and \ndilation are then performed on the binary image This is a \ntwo-step process which encompasses a total of ninth order \nerosion and dilation using a 2x2 square operator as well as a \ndisc operator of radius four. The purpose of the erosion and \ndilation process is to extract the objects of interest while \nFigure 3 – SCC Tile Layout and Power Management \nOverview [4] \n \nFigure 4 – Stereoscopic Processing Algorithm  \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 4 \neliminating spurious data that may be left from the binary \nconversion process.  After the erosion and dilation process \nis completed, only the two objects of interest are left with no \nbackground data, and centroid determination of both objects \nare determined. \nAlgorithm Implementation on SCC \nThe algorithm outlined above will be run in a parallel \nimplementation on the Intel SCC. The SCC is first \ninitialized and configured in regards to how many cores will \nbe loading and executing the algorithm. Each core is \ndesignated with a voltage-frequency gear. A gear is defined \nby a specific voltage and frequency combination. At this \npoint, the specified number of cores for the current \nsimulation will load image data from either main or local \nmemory and run the stereoscopic processing for centroid \ndetermination. The results will then be output to a single \ncore During the process, the SCC will be monitored and \nmeasurements will be logged for the power and \nperformance metrics, which will be presented later. The \nSCC implementation process is illustrated in Figure 5. \n4 RESULTS \nAlthough Intel’s SCC may be a relevant platform in many \nof the aspects mentioned in Section 2, it does not excel for \nthe core microarchitecture employed, which is based on a \nvery simple architecture that was first introduced by Intel in \nMarch 1994 as the Pentium P54C version of the Pentium™ \nclass. Although a few modifications were done for this \nplatform, it continues to be a simple architecture, lacking nout-of-order execution among a few other aspects \nincorporated within modern processors [6]. Therefore, a ncomparison of the results obtained with the SCC using only \na few cores rather than trying to exploit the platform as a \nwhole may not illustrate the real benefits that can be \nobtained when using this platform in particular and many-\ncore architectures in general. In this section we present the \nperformance results offered by the SCC and compared them \nto those obtained from a commercial PC running Matlab \nwith an Intel core i5 processor operating at 2.30 GHz and \ncontaining 8 GB of RAM. It took around 52 seconds for our nreference platform to completely process one image pair. \nDuring all the experiments that were run in the SCC, which \nresults are illustrated in Figures 6 – 9, only one image pair is \nbeing processed by each core during each run. In the case of \nFigure 6 – Execution Time Per Number of Cores and Ratio Between Time and Number of Samples Processed \n \nFigure 7 – Total Power Consumption and Ratio Between Power and Number of Samples Processed \nFigure 5 – SCC Parallel Implementation  \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 5 \none core, only one image set was processed. In the case of \ntwo cores, only two image sets and so on up to a total of \nforty-eight. \nThe performance results are presented in Figure 6. It can be \nobserved how increasing the processing load does not \nlinearly impact the processing time. When utilizing one to \ntwelve cores, it takes the platform around 64 seconds to \nprocess the images. As we increase the number of cores \nfrom thirteen to eighteen, the time to complete the algorithm \nincreases linearly up to approximately 71 seconds, and for a ncore utilization of nineteen or higher, the processing time \nremains around 71 seconds.  \nFigure 6 also presents the ratio between the processing time \nand the total number of image pairs processed. This curve nshows a dramatic decrease in delay per image pair as the \nnumber of cores increases, ranging from around 64 seconds \nwhen only one core is being used down to less than 1.5 \nseconds when using all forty-eight cores nThe total power consumed by the cores, as well as power \nper image pair processed, are presented in Figure 7 This \ngraph shows how increasing the number of cores results in \nan increase in power consumption. When only one core is \nused for processing, the platform consumes around 51 watts \nof power, and for full chip utilization this number increases \nup to 98 watts. It should be mentioned that in the cases \nwhere only a few cores take part processing the application, \nall the remaining cores are idle but still ON and therefore 


nconsuming power. If total power is required to be optimal, \nselecting the configurations that use lower core count might \nbe the right choice.  \nFrom the right side of Figure 7, representing the ratio of \npower per image pair, one can observe a dramatic decrease \nin power per image pair as the number of cores increases. It nranges from the initial 51 watts for one image pair down to \n2 watts per image pair when utilizing all the cores. \nAfter analyzing the results obtained from the performance \nand power metrics, results containing the energy consumed \nby each configuration are shown in Figure 8. This graph \nreaffirms how the energy consumed by a system is \ndependent on the balance between performance and power, \nnot simply processor speed or power dissipation alone. For \nthe absolute energy consumption values, it can be observed \nthat when only one core is used for processing, the platform \nconsumes around 3300 joules of energy to complete its \ncomputations, while for full chip utilization this number \nincreases up to 6940 joules.  \nThe ratio of energy per image pair presented behaves \nsimilarly to the power metric. The relative energy consumed \nby image pair processed has a quadratic decrease as the \nnumber of cores increases. It goes from the initial 3300 \njoules per image pair down to less than 145 for forty-eight \ncores. \nIt is very common to consider the power-performance as the nmetric for selecting a best configuration to use. Usually, \ndifferent configurations would impact different metrics, it \nbeing very uncommon to have one configuration that best \nsatisfies all the metrics at the same time. From a system \npoint of view, minimizing the execution time, the power or \nthe energy consumption may be the first priority. However, \neven if the total energy is minimized, the user may not be \nFigure 8 – Total Energy Consumption and Ratio Between Total Energy and Number of Samples Processed \nFigure 9 – Energy-Delay Product \(EDP IEEE \n 6 \nsatisfied with extended system response time and vice versa \n[7, 8]. Because of this, the energy-delay product \(EDP application in the Intel’s SCC. \nIn Figure 9 EDP metric is presented for each used \nconfiguration. The results from this metric have a very \nsimilar behavior to those of the power and energy. It can be \nnoticed how increasing the amount of cores increases the \nabsolute EDP values, but at the same time the EDP per \nimage pairs ratio rapidly becomes better. \n5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nImprovements in performance and relative navigation \nsolutions over single thread systems can be achieved \nthrough multi- and many-core computing Stochastic \nrelative orbit determination methods benefit from the higher \nmeasurement frequencies, allowing them to more accurately \ndetermine the associated statistical properties of the relative \norbital elements. In addition, more accurate orbit \ndetermination can lead to reduced fuel consumption and \nextended mission capabilities and duration. \nThe Single-Chip Cloud Computer continues Intel’s and the \nwhole industry’s trend toward employing higher core counts \nto replace the increases in clock frequency that have resulted \nin high power requirements, difficult to control high \ntemperature, associated lower reliability, and chip design ndifficulties [6]. \nKnowing that the many-core era is close to arriving, we can \nexpect the commercialization and availability of many-core \nplatforms will not be limited to the research community \nonly. Therefore projecting not only future but also actual \napplications toward many-core architectures is a critical step nthat would warranty exploiting the potential benefits offered \nby those architectures over single or few thread systems; \nspecifically for real-time visual-based satellite proximity \noperations missions, where the nature of these applications \nallows a maximum utilization of the host platform. \nAs for future work, the algorithm implemented in this \nproject may be further optimized targeting the SCC \narchitecture. This should offer not only better performance \nresults, but improve the power and energy consumption as \nwell.  \nFurther research can also be done to increase the complexity \nand number of algorithms to be executed in the Intel’s nSingle-Chip Cloud Computer. It might serve as an \nintermediate step, which experiences would be helpful with nhaving a smoother assimilation of future many-core \nplatforms.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n[1] T.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
