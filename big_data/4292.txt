For the sake of privacy, the Uploader component removes the privacy related information before it transmits the logs to the HDFS  \(Hadoop distributed file system He re we de fine  the flow using the {source IP, source port, destination IP destination port, protocol}, which is referred to as 5-tuple principle. The flow logs contain information about many traffic features, such as traffic bytes, Server IP address, the location and the time when subscribers log into the net etc 2.2 Data description TMS keeps running day and night throughout a year. In this paper, we take the data collected from 3 days which are from different month for an example. And we pick a day from different month randomly to insure that the result we get reflects the real situation of su bscribers. The volume of the flow logs and number of flow each day are shown in TABLE I. Note that the flow logs contain a lot of information, but we merely use part of them in this paper 3 Subscriber traffic distribution After capturing the traffic data, more detailed analyses are carried out on the mobile subscr iber behaviour. In this section we mainly show the amount of traffic generated by subscribers in the network on the 3 different days Fig. 2 \(a\shows the cumulative distribution function \(CDF of traffic generated per subscriber. This figure shows a wide range of traffic generated by different subscribers in the network. The median of the traffic is close to 600KB per day However, there are heavy subscribers who generate as high as 10GB per day as well as light su bscribers generating less than 1 KB per day. We see the CDF slightly shifts towards the left for Day 3 and Day 2 indicating less traffic compared to Day1 It reveals that traffic generated by subscribes changing slightly on different days We also present a normalized view of traffic over a percentage of subscribers in Fig. 2 \(b\ is interesting to see that only 1% of the subscribers \(out of approximately about 3 million unique subscribers who appear in each day\create 40% of the daily network traffic and 10% of the subscribers create 70% of the daily network traffic. This presents a significant imbalance of network usage among subscribers with few subscribers hogging the much of the network resource. In the following section, the spatial and temporal characteristics of these subscribers will be discussed

However, our captured data set provide information about the LAC-CI the subscribers are associated to when they are using mob ile data services. A location area code \(LAC\dentifies an area in the network to which the cell belongs and a cell identity \(CI\entifies the cell within the area in the network to which it be longs. It can be said that a unique LAC-CI specifies a unique area. In our flow logs, we not only have the LAC-CI at which subscribers are when they get on-line but also have the off-line one. To some extent, the number of LAC-CI visited by a subscriber reflects the movement range of the subscriber. In this section, we study the behavior of mobile subscribers in terms of their spatial characteristics and explore the relations between traffic generated by subscribers and their movement range 4.1 LAC-CI visited Firstly, we look into the number of distinct LAC-CI an individual subscriber visits per day. Fig. 3 shows the CDF of the number of distinct LAC-CI visited by each subscriber in a day. Note that the distribution of three days is very similar Overall, the movement range is not wide in terms of the number of distinct LAC-CI vis ited. Roughly, more than 30 of the subscribers are stationary, meaning they constrain within a cell. And about 95% of the subscribers travel across less than 10 distinct LAC-CIs in a day. We find that there are also few subscribers who visit more than 50 distinct LAC-CIs however, the number of them only accounts for 0.05% of daily subscribers 4.2 Relating subscriber movement range and traffic It is natural to relate the subscriber spatial activity and the volume of traffic they generate. We categorize subscribers based on two metrics: \(i\ber of distinct LAC-CI visited and \(ii\raffic volume gene rated. For the first classification standard, we classify subscriber s into 5 groups according to the number of distinct LAC-CI th ey visit in one day. For each category of subscribers, we plot the CDF of traffic volume generated per day in Fig. 4 \(a\ote that while the plot lines appear similar, due to the lo g-scale of the horizontal axis there is actually significant difference in traffic volume for different categories. As shown in the graph, the median of the traffic generated by subscribes in the widest movement range category is roughly 30 times th at of the subscribers in the narrowest movement range category. In Fig. 4 \(b\e subscribers are split into 3 group s based on the traffic volume they generate in one day and the CDF of the number of distinct LAC-CI visited by each group in a day is drawn. We can see that almost half of the ‘light subscribers’ \(subscribers who generate traffic less than 1MB per day\one LAC-CI in one day. However, when considering all subscribers as shown in Figure 3, the percentage of subscribers who stay in one LAC-CI declines to about 30 In other words, Fig. 4 \(b\ is similar to Fig. 4 \(a\ in the trend that ‘light subscribers’ tend to be more stationary.

We describe the temporal activity of subscribers by the number of hours in a day that they generate traffic. This addresses basic questions such as whether the subscribers generate traffic frequently or only occasionally 5.1 Subscribers active hours To understand the hourly activity of subscribers, we plot the distribution of hours in a day that the subscribers generate traffic. Fig. 5 shows the CDF of the number of hours that subscribers generate traffic. We see that about 20% of subscribers generate traffic only in a single hour in a day. A typical subscriber \(median\s active in 5 different hours per day. Here, we come to the conclusion that a large fraction of subscribers generate traffic only in a few hours within the day 5.2 Relating subscriber active hours and traffic In this section, we draw relation between the traffic generated by subscribers and how frequently they appear in the trace To begin with, we group the subscribers according to the number of hours that they generate traffic per day. Then for the sake of contrast, we draw the CDF of traffic volume generated in a day for each group. From the Fig. 6 \(a\we can see clearly that the more hours subscribers appear in a day the more traffic they generate. To further investigate this phenomenon, we classify subscribers into 3 groups based on traffic volume they generate. For each group, Fig. 6 \(b\hows the distribution of hourly activity. In this plot, we notice that there is a big difference between ‘heavy subscribers subscribers who generate traffic more than 10 MB per day and ‘light subscribers’. A typical light subscriber appears in 1 to 2 different hours in a day while a typical heavy subscriber appears in 16 to 18 different hours. Fig. 6 \(a\nd Fig. 6 \(b indicate jointly that heavy subs cribers tend to spend more hours on the mobile Internet 6 Conclusion In this paper, we analyze spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile internet services in cellu lar data network based on a large set of data using MapReduce which is a distributed parallel programming model with proved low-cost and highefficiency features. We have made several observations related to traffic load, spatial dynamics and temporal dynamics which will lead to better resource planning and network designs that finally benefit the subscribers Acknowledgements This work is supported in pa rt by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(61072061 Important National Science & Technology Specific Projects \(201 2ZX03002008 111 Project of China \(B08004 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Un iversities \(2012RC0121

  8 The transition from idle state to gimbal activity state requires use of a set of critical commands to disable the gimbal safety inhibit. This inhibit prevents inadvertent operation of the laser during external crew or robotic activities by preventing actuation of the gimbal pointing. In order to disable the inhibit, a pair of two commands, one 223arm\224 and one \223fire\224, must be sent in succession to the flight software. Following receipt of these commands, the gimbal can be commanded to move away from the stow position and away from the limit switches that bound the range of motion Upon movement of the gimbal, the Flight System enters gimbal activity state. The primary operations activity within this state is the gimbal calibration, which defines the reference points for each axis. This activity is a sequence of movement commands that drive the gimbal through its full range of motion and establish reference points at the edge of each axis by measuring where the limit switches are actuated. Since the actuators lack encoders, the gimbal can only determine its position by counting commanded steps The transition from gimbal activity state to laser enabled state requires additional critical commands to be sent to the FS to disable the laser safety inhibits. The laser arm/fire critical commands disable the inhibit preventing closure of the 28V power relay to the laser. In order to decentralize the laser activation process for safety purposes, independent commands must be sent from the OPALS MOS and the POIC for 28V power to be routed to the laser. Each of the commands closes an independent power relay along the 28V power path on the FS power board. Once the 28V power is provided to the laser, the FS enters \223laser enabled\224 state The major activities in this state are the powering on of the flight camera and the powering of the flight laser unit to full power. The latter involves activating a 5V power relay to the laser booster, which is controlled by its own inhibit that requires an additional arm/fire command pair to be sent Once these major activities are complete, the FS can be commanded to point toward the first entry in the Blind Pointing Table, at which point, the FS is configured for Demonstration The FS enters demonstration state upon execution of the commence_demo command. Since this transition must be set to occur at a specific time determined by the ISS trajectory, this command will be scheduled in a command sequence. The Flight System restricts all commands during this state except for the abort_safe command to transition the entire payload to safe state, should an anomaly occur The sequence of activities in the demonstration state follows the description in the first part of section 3 The post-Demonstration activities involve safely powering off the laser, driving the gimbal to stow, and re-enabling all inhibits. These activities are accomplished by a post-demo command sequence that executes automatically upon nominal exit of demonstration state. Once all inhibits are  Figure 7: Flight System states diagram 


  enabled, the Flight System is returned to i d begin downlinking  accumulated engin e camera frames from the file system via t Once all products are downlinked and a fin a made, the 28V power is removed from the the Flight System activities.

After many tweaks and focused discussion outside of the full PSRP the OPALS CBCS matrix was approved for Phase 2 As Phase 3 approaches, all agreed-to verifications of hazard controls must be performed, documented, and submitted Any deviations from the agreed-to verifications must be documented and approved by members of the PSRP In addition to the Flight Safety Reviews \(FSRs\und Safety Review schedule is also negotiated and a package is submitted.  This process is very similar to the PSRP one, but the scope of the hazards is limited to ground operations at the launch and processing facilities The key to successfully passing the FSRs has been constant early, and open communication with the PSRP. It has allowed for the quick identification of hazards and it has prevented the project from locking itself into designs that either could have adversely impacted safety or could have made compliance significantly more difficult. The PSRP and everyone involved in the safety side of the interface have shown great flexibility in allowing OPALS design freedom to ensure its mission success while enforcing a high standard for the safety of the ISS and those inhabiting it 5  D RIVERS   C ONSTRAINTS  AND R ESULTING I MPLEMENTATION  OPALS is no exception when it comes to facing the typical challenges that most space flight projects have to overcome throughout their lifecycle. Cost and schedule always seem insufficient. The workforce is sometimes stretched thin. All these challenges create constraints, end up driving the decision-making process and inescapably shape the final product. There are, however, many aspects that set OPALS apart from the average space borne instrument, and they too came with their own drivers and constraints Overall, the drivers and constraints can be classified as internal and external, with each category further divided into process- or technically-flavored This section is dedicated to examples, spanning each of those categories, of drivers and constraints that have in one way or another influenced the implementation of the project Internal, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints The aspects falling under this section refer to those whose common denominator is the internally-mandated JPL process. The most influential and prevailing of these processes are documented in the JPL Design Principles and JPL Flight Project Practices. These documents provide guidelines on everything from cost, schedule reserves and technical margins to the pedigree of the parts and components used by the flight article and the level of documentation required Class D 227The biggest impact on the project, second only to the stringent cost cap, was the decision to implement it as a Class D payload risk classification per NASA NPR 8705.4 This decision was less of a constraint than it was a driver and it ultimately gave the project more flexibility in making decisions. The ramifications of this decision are many including the risk posture of the project in parts selection sparing philosophy, hardware handling requirements qualification program, fault protection, and extent of formal verification of requirements Early on in its lifecycle, the project sought to define the Class D implementation approach within the guidelines set by NASA procedural requirements. Specifically the project was allowed to 200  Build one proto-flight model with limited engineering models \(EMs\he only subsystem to have a full EM is the avionics. Other EMs include the acquisition camera one motor driver, and the in-house developed power board 200  Limit parts sparing to long-lead items only. The project only purchased one spare actuator and a few of the avionics cards. There are no spares for the laser, power board, camera, or any structural components 200  Use COTS hardware wherever possible. This aspect is discussed in further detail in a subsequent section 200  Forgo radiation or parts support. The extensive usage of COTS components implies, to a large extent, the absence of radiation susceptibility data, along with other environmental information. Thus, as early as the Mission Concept Review, the project and its stakeholders have accepted the potential missionending risk of unrecoverable single event upsets 200  Limit hardware and software Quality Assurance prior to system level integration and test. Typically, HQA/SQA involvement begins early in subsystem development well in advance of system I&T 200  Limit flight tech support to final torqueing and high risk procedures. The philosophy here is similar to the HQA/SQA involvement Requirements and V&V\227 Likely the most unglamorous aspect of producing a space-wo rthy payload is developing the set of requirements that govern its function and behavior. While Class-D status does not give the project a pass on developing requirements, it can shape the way the process is conducted and the extent to which requirements are developed For example, higher-class projects typically develop requirements down to level five or six, and bin them in dozens, if not hundreds of sets or modules. By contrast OPALS currently only has 782 requirements spread over 33 modules, with none of them containing more than 105 items. Of the 694 ISS requirements only 376 are applicable to OPALS, accounting for 48% of the total OPALS set Similarly, of the 117 launch vehicle requirements, only 58 are levied on OPALS. This means that the project has only 


  348 project-specific requirements that it in t verify. Figure 13 breaks down the requirements, including ISS and launc h residing at the various levels OPALS, however, is no poster child f development as it fell into the same trap t h projects\227regardless of size and risk verification and validation \(V&V\ time: it unnecessary requirements At CDR time OPALS realized that requirements it was signing up to verify d and testing, totaling almost 1300 \(796 OP A LV\, had become unmanageable give n schedule and cost-to-go.

  15 manufacturer specification for vibration tolerance.  To deal with this issue, the rigid tray assembly that houses the avionics and fans is mounted on a system of wire-rope isolators designed to dampen random vibrations within the specific frequency spectra produced by the launch vehicle These isolators protect delicate solder joints and other nonrugged components from being torn apart by launch loads Further, in much the same way as the loss of circulation during power outages provides a natural means of insulation against heat loss, the wire rope isolator system\222s poor thermal conductivity also impedes conduction to the outer structure of the sealed container External, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints While many decisions were internally motivated by the JPL processes and the OPALS paradigm, a significant number also came via the ISS and launch vehicle interfaces, both programmatically and technically As one might anticipate, the ISS interface in particular impacted the OPALS day-to-day operations as well as the design features it implemented. The most clear example of this aspect came via the over 400 requirements imposed by the ISS program on the OPALS payload, followed by the V&V process mandated to demonstrate compliance Requirements 227As one of the first payloads to negotiate both the ISS and Dragon interfaces, OPALS has been routinely involved in technical changes beginning and ending with its interface requirements.  A considerable ongoing effort within OPALS and its partners has been to solidify the understanding of the requirements levied When OPALS began in 2009, the Dragon had neither flown nor been fully designed.  This was best represented in the miniscule 16 provided requirements that were largely placeholders for what would  become the Dragon\222s interface specification.  At that point, expectations were that OPALS would be completed well before its Dragon flight. This schedule disconnect led to a considerable technical disconnect In order to proceed with OPALS development despite the lack of a full set of design requirements assumptions had to be made in three key areas: power, connectivity, and the launch environment.  The first question of power came about for an obvious reason: OPALS has thermally sensitive optics and commercial equipment, and these components need heater power to be kept warm in space.  Without requirements on Dragon power provisions, the project\222s first assumption was that the thermal control hardware designed for the on-orbit ISS environment would also prove valid during a Dragon ascent.  After exhaustive integrated thermal analysis, this assumption, and the resulting engineering implementation, has proven to be valid, and an additional 12 pages of requirements and supporting data now reflect this interface design After requirements were negotiated and an agreement was reached to provide sufficient thermal power during ascent the question remained of how this power would be routed into the OPALS payload.  To direct the efforts towards a solution of connectivity, OPALS turned to the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle \(HTV\d Space Shuttle designs that powered FRAM-based payloads similar to OPALS.  These additional carrier requirements allowed several connectivity options and it was thus taken to be a valid assumption that the Dragon team could design around OPALS\222 desired cabling pin assignments.  The OPALS design was thus submitted to SpaceX and, as this was the first request for a specific option, the OPALS connectivity solution has become the primary power distribution option amongst external Dragon cargo requirements The project\222s greatest challenge, however, was the need to design the FS prior to receiving any validated launch  Figure 15: Early design of the sealed container did not optimize component pl acement or airflow  Figure 16: CFD analysis led to a new component layout that allowed for more efficient heat removal 


  16 loading requirements.  To address this, OPALS began with JPL and NASA\222s extensive historical data on expected launch loads, amended with ample margin and overlaid with standard levels on workmanship. The resulting crude spectrum was then supplied to the ISS and SpaceX dynamics teams who over the course of several months helped refine test plans to a conservative but agreeable level, which again proved to be valid \(and indeed conservative\via integrated analysis and testing. At the time of this writing OPALS had successfully completed vibration testing Lastly, the project has dealt with the uncertainty that comes via requirements variability from the ISS interface. Since OPALS began, 37% of the 694 ISS interface requirements have changed. Even though only 376 of them are applicable to OPALS, the project has had to maintain cognizance in this regard over the full set.  Despite the fact that the ISS is an operational facility and many components have been flying in orbit for several years, both OPALS and the ISSP are still learning about the function and performance of these components.  As such, there have been ample updates to the electrical and robotic interface requirement segments These requirement changes are executed methodically in a thoroughly reviewed manner.  After internal ISS coordination, pending requirement updates are quickly disseminated amongst payload developers.  After external review by existing and prospective payloads, signatures are requested and requirements are enacted V&V 227Verification and Validation includes the final work done to certify both that the payload meets the word of the requirements, and that it performs the intended function 55% of OPALS\222 requirements to be verified are provided by its external interfaces, including the ISS and Dragon Though verified along with all other project requirements these interface requirements demand a different balance of focus.  As these requirements are provided by external entities they are managed outside of JPL and subject to external verification.  OPALS, therefore, has no formal validation program for these requirements beyond ongoing interface systems engineering diligence.  While this externalized approach minimizes internal efforts, it simultaneously increases verification  overhead Verification of each external interface requirement falls under the cognizance of an external Discipline Engineer DE\d the OPALS verification program is built around this external approval process, which is diagramed in Figure 17.  These external engineers represent the external hardware expertise necessary to ultimately understand validate and approve all interactions with their hardware.  It is important to note that these engineers support a multitude of projects across geographic boundaries, and their ability to provide dedicated attention to OPALS is attenuated by the breath of the projects they support Internal to OPALS, an abundance of verification data is generated for these DEs in the verification of the 452 external requirements.  The planning, technical coordination, and direction of this work is coordinated between the OPALS External Interface Engineer and the cognizant engineers within OPALS. As data and plans have been generated over years of interaction among these organizations, it is incumbent upon the EIE to ensure internal consistency and remedy problems across evolving interfaces External, Technically-Derived Drivers and Constraints The ISS-imposed requirements provide the specification for the physical interface to the station, and, via the PSRP process, also provide direction on meeting the safety considerations that come with the Class A status of the ISS This section will highlight how technical specifications from the ISS impacted aspects of the OPALS design Mass & Power Budgets 227Most payloads will find the ISS allocation for mass and 28V operational power to be quite generous at 490 lbs. \(excluding the top half of the FRAM\227 the ExPA plate\d 504 watts, respectively. The ISS also provides 750 watts on a 120V operational line and an additional 300 watts of power on a 120V heater line Expected to come in under 400 lbs., OPALS fits well within its mass allocation. In fact, at no point in its development did the OPALS mass margin\227calculated as \(AllocationCBE\llocation\227fall below 15%, and since CDR it has been hovering around 30%. The 28V ops power margin has been even more generous, hovering at or above 60% for much of the projects lifecycle, while the 120V ops and 120V heater lines have seen equally generous margins of over 60% and 70 %, respectively In space, mass and power are drivers more often than not For OPALS the opposite has been the case, to the point where the excess allocations has been used to solve problems in other areas. One such example has been the  Figure 17:  The OPALS ISS requirement verification process is built around th e ISS approval process

  19 turn lead to a design that required forced convective cooling and vibration dampening, both uncommon for modern-day space payloads. Furthermore, it allowed the project flexibility in tailoring its verification and validation program for non-ISS requirements to save cost and schedule The focus of space-borne instruments is usually on the flight articles, which in the case of OPALS is the FRAM-based payload to be externally installed on the ISS. However most, if not all, projects must also develop a ground infrastructure to support the operations of the flight asset For OPALS, despite being more akin to an instrument than a spacecraft, that was certainly the case as significant development was required for both the optical ground station to enable the transmissi on of a beacon and receipt of the optical downlink for the former, and for the MOS to support commanding and telemetry The use of the OCTL facility in California greatly reduced the amount of development required to receive and process the optical downlink, and to transmit the beacon needed by the FS to locate the ground station. The development was thus restricted to the optics needed to condition the light beam for processing by the hardware receiver and the software decoder The design of the MOS was, by and large, dictated by the interface to the ISS\222s expansive payloads operations infrastructure located at Ma rshall Space Flight Center Because the interface was already mature and well understood, the project\222s efforts were primarily focused on ensuring compatibility rather than developing its own capability. The savings afforded by leveraging the existence of the already operating infrastructure cannot be understated A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors express their gratitude to the entire OPALS team for their dedication and hard work, and to the mentors that have guided the team on a path to success.
