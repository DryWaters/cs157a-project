An Extended Model of the Neocognitron for Pattern Partitioning and Pattern Composition Deliang Wang Brain Simulation Laboratory Computer Science Department University of Southern California Los Angeles CA 90089-0782 Abstract In this paper we propose two neuron growth rules the neuron splitting rule and the neuron formation rule for self-organization of adaptive neural networks Using these two rules we extend the model of the Neocognitron 
such that when presented with part of a stored pattern or a composite image consisting of many stored patterns the pattern will be recognized properly The extended model does pattern partitioning when it recognizes that the input image is a part of a stored pattern and pattern composition or association when many stored patterns are presented at the same time This extended Neocognitron is demonstrated by computer simulation We suggest that the mechanism proposed in this paper is a plausible model for 
child cognitive development and useful for visual pattern recognition Introduction The Neocognitron is a neural network model which was designed as a mechanism for visual pattern recognition by Fukushima 3][4 In this model several layers of cells are arranged in a cascade such that the receptive field of each layer increases with the depth of the layer The whole process of pattern recognition using the Neocognitron can be divided into two serial stages a training stage and a recognition stage 
During the training stage a set of stimulus patterns are presented repetitively and the network learns these patterns by modifying the efficacies of synaptic connections in an unsupervised way Each cell in the deepest layer or back layer represents a learned pattern During the recognition stage if a pattern presented in the input layer fires a cell in the back layer the model recognizes the input pattern as the stored pattern represented by the firing cell Once training is  Preparation of this paper 
was supported in part by grant no lROl NS24926 from the NIH MichaeI Arbib PrincipaI Investigator finished there is no further modification of synaptic weights in the Neocognitron The elegant property of this process is that the pattern recognition is not affected by a shift in position or small distortion of the input pattern This constitutes the main feature of the Neocognitron compared to the early Cognitron model proposed by the same author ZI However the Neocognitron performs 
pattern recognition on one pattern at a time. All patterns stored in the back layer are individual patterns and no relation can be established among these patterns Also if we present a part of a learned pattern to the network the typical response of Neocognitron is to recognize it as the whole stored pattern This response may be appropriate for pattern classification but it is not desirable for more accurate pattern recognition In short the Neocognitron is not yet a proper model for pattern 
recognition in a more complex visual context in which several patterns or a part of pattern are presented as a single visual stimulus. In his recent work, Fukushima proposed an extended model of the Neocognitron intended to respond to a composite figure consisting of multiple patterns 61[71 The performance of this extended model when presented with a composite image is to respond to each pattern separately This mechanism obviously neglects the wholeness of the presented composite pattern That is the network loses the information that 
these individual patterns are presented at the same time In this paper, we focus on the pattern recognition in a complex visual context using the Neocognitron, and propose two neuron growth rules the neuron splitting rule and the neuron formation rule in order to do pattern partitioning and pattern composition respectively With these two neuron growth rules the Neocognitron can dynamically grow at the stage of recognition and thus enhance its recognition capability with practice 11-267 


Specifically we extend the Neocognitron model in the following aspects when only part of a stored pattern is presented the extended model partitions this part from the whole stored pattern when a composite image which consists of several stored patterns is presented, a new cell is formed in a composite pattern layer UC-layer to represent this image The UC-layer is a new layer formed in the proposed model which connects to the back layer of the Neocognitron Figure 1 Schematic diagram illustrating the synaptic co~ections between layers in the Neocognitron from 31 once the model stores a composite image it associates all patterns in a composite image if we present a subset In the case of e=1 in Eq.\(l Ucel\(kel,n stands for U of the composite image and we have Ke-l=l Here ae\(ke-l,v,ke and be\(ke Basic Structure of the Neocognitron The Neocognitron is composed of a cascade of modular structures preceded by a input layer U0 Each of the modular structures is composed of two layers a Us layer consisting of S-cells and a UC layer consisting of C cells S-cells or C-cells in any single layer are further divided into many cell-planes each of which detects a different optimal stimulus feature It is assumed in Neocognitron that all the cells in a single cell-plane have represent the efficacies of the excitatory and inhibitory modifiable \(learning\synapses, respectively Because all the S-cells in the same S-plane are assumed to have identical sets of afferent synapses, w\(kel,v,ke and b@p do not contain any argument to indicate.the position n of the receptive field of cell Use\(ke,n The parameter re is a constant used to control the inhibition due to Vcel\(n which sends an inhibitory output to Use\(kp,,n The output of Vccl\(n is defined as inputs of same spatial distribution and only the positions of the input cells are shifted in parallel depending on the positions of receiving cells Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram illustrating the synaptic connections between layers Each tetragon drawn with heavy lines represents an Splane or a C-plane and each vertical tetragon drawn with thin lines in which S-planes or C-planes are enclosed represents an Slayer or a C-layer c cel\(v kel n+v 2 k1=1 VE st vccl\(n  The efficacies of the unmodifiable synapses ce-l\(v are determined so as to decrease monoto~c~y with respect to I v I and to be normalized The connections from S-cells to C-cells are all Umodifiable The output of a C-Cdl in the k-fh C-plane of the th module is given by 3 In the Neocognitron U denotes the output of the input layer where n iS two two-dimensional coordinate vector indicating the location of the cell The output of an S-cell of the k@h Splane in the e-th module is given by where XI  max\(x 0 11-268

In accordance with their experiment we suggest two hypotheses for the growth of neurons by which experience can determine the growth of an adaptive neural network. The two hypotheses are 1 Neuron sulittinv rule We call a synaptic pathway a prominent pathway if the efficacy of the synaptic connection is remarkably large A cell N is split into two cells if and only if a true subset of all of its prominent pathways have remarkable inputs This can be described more clearly as suppose N receives inputs XI  x through pathways W1 W2  W respectively and the first m pathways are prominent i.e W1 W2  Wm  0 If only a part of the inputs XI x2  xm say xal Xa2  xak\are firing, then N is split into two cells NI and N2 cell NI receiving Xal xa2  Xak as well as xm+1  x N2 receiving XI x2  xm  Xal Xa2  xak as well as xm+1  xn Both NI and N2 inherit all efferent connections from N This splitting process is shown in Fig.2A If we consider all prominent inputs to N as individual features and the task of N is to combine these features to form a new pattern with a larger receptive field, this splitting rule states that if part of the pattern that neuron N is supposed to recognize appears in the visual field, this neuron will be split into two cells one of which recognizes the presented part of the pattern while the other recognizes the rest of the pattern This rule implies that the visual cortex will grow if the visual system memorizes complex visual patterns and then is presented with simpler patterns 2 Neuron formation rule A new neuron N is formed if and only if more than one neuron is firing at the same time in a particular layer Let yi\(t represent the output of a cell Ni at time t For neurons NI N2  Nk k  11 if yl\(t  0 y2\(t  0  yk\(t Oat some time t a new cell N will be formed which A I x1   w\222   I Xm B T   Figure 2 A.Neuron splitting rule If a true subset of all of the prominent pathways of N has remarkable inputs N is splitted into two neurons NI and Np B Neuron formation rule A new neuron N is formed if NI N2   Nk are firing at the same time 11-269 


receives NI N2  Nk as its inputs This formation process is shown in Fig.2B If we consider each neuron NI N2  Nk as representing a different feature the newly formed neuron N represents the pattern consisting of all the features represented by NI N2  Nk The cell N reflects the concurrence of features represented by NI N2  Nk because it is formed only when these neurons fire at the same time In the following sections we will apply these two rules to the Neocognitron in order to endow it with the extended recognition capabilities in a complex visual context Pattern Partitioning The extensions proposed in this paper influence the recognition stage i.e after learning is finished We only apply the neuron splitting rule in the last module where the receptive field of each cell is almost as large as the entire input layer Suppose USL is the last Slayer and UCL is the last C-layer Each cell in USL receives input from one area of cells in each plane of UCL-1 Each such plane represents a different feature To use the neuron splitting rule each C-plane in layer UCL-1 is considered a single input pathway to USL and the input connection whose weight has been strengthened during learning stage is considered a prominent pathway The S-plane in USL will be split into two S-planes if only some of the prominent features are presented Since each C-plane pairs with an S plane once an S-plane is split the corresponding output is chosen as a candidate for the representatives If two or more candidates appear in a single S-plane, only the one yielding the largest output among them is chosen as the representative from that S-plane. Quantitatively UsL\(kL n  maxn\(maxkL\(USL\(kL n 5 2 Detect Implicit Features Each representative USL\(kL n represents a detected feature of the input pattern Presynaptic inputs to any representative are features with smaller receptive fields which will be integrated in the representative cell Before applying the splitting rule we determine which inputs to a representative cell are prominent features and whether the prominent features are explicit or implicit A prominent feature is exp2icit if this feature is present in the current input pattern Otherwise the prominent feature is called implicif feature Discover prominent features for any plane kL-1 in layer UCL-1 according to 11 the expected contribution of plane kL-l to a representative UsL\(kL n is given by Hence kL-l is a prominent feature if and only if Ce\(kL-1 kL n  0 Discover implicit features for any plane kL-1 in layer UCL-1 according to l we compute its actual contribution to USL\(kL n as C-plane splits too More precisely the following steps are taken during pattern partitioning 1 Choosinv Representatives Given Ce\(kL-1 kL n and Ca\(kL-l kL n an implicit feature satisfies Ca  0 and Ce  0 recorded as f\(kL-1  0 and an explicit feature satisfies Ca  0 recorded as f\(kL-l  1 3 Splitting Process To partition a pattern the part of a stored pattern being presented in the input layer must be determined The presented pattern can be determined using the same procedure as choosing representatives during training stage From each %column in the layer UsL in to the stimulus pattern the S-Cd yielding the largest If there is a plane kL-1 such that f\(kL-1  0 splitting is done as follows: create a new Splane ki which copies plane kL and its inputs and outputs also create a corresponding C-plane which receives inputs from the 11-270 


kL"-th plane of USL in exactly the same way as the kL'-th plane of UC receives inputs from the kL'-th plane of USL In plane kL of USL set aL\(kL-l v kL  0 if f\(kL-1  0 in plane kL of USL set aL\(kL-1 v kL  0 if f\(kL-1  I In addition, some modifications are needed to maintain the original hierarchy of the Neocognitron Every time the splitting process is executed a new plane is created In this way the Neocognitron grows dynamically with experience, yielding a new form of self organization for neural networks different from synaptic adaption Once a new plane in USL is generated the number of stored patterns is increased by 1 thereby expanding the storage capacity of the Neocognitron Pattern Composition In this section we will study how to extend the Neocognitron so that it can give desired response when presented with more than one pattern We call this kind of input a composite image A new layer called the composite layer Uc for short is added to the Neocognitron as the deepest layer which connects to layer UCL Each cell in the UC layer represents a composite image and is assumed to be binary. With the Uc layer, this model can recognize and associate composite images appearing in the input layer 1 ComDosite Imaee Creation The neuron formation rule is used to create cells in UC layer In the Neocognitron if more than one stored pattern is presented to the input layer following the lateral inhibition rule of 4 which is expressed as an arithmetic mean there will be more than one cell firing in layer UCL each of which corresponds to each single pattern, provided that the strength of a single pattern is larger than the arithmetic mean of all inputs to the UCL layer Suppose at a certain time the group of firing cells in UCL are Cl  Cn Following the neuron formation rule if n  1 a new cell C in UC is formed which receives Cl C2  Cn as its inputs. C represents the composite image Cl Cp  C Define input\(Cj  Cl C2  CJ 2 Composite Imaee Recognition Here we suppose that only when all its inputs are firing a cell in UC layer is activated This is expressed in the following formula v c E U C fires iff image 2 input\(C 8 Hence there is a possibility that more than one cell fires when an image is presented If so it implies that the current image contains more than one previously stored image If there exists a C such that input\(C  image the current input image doesn't form any new cell in UC layer 3 Association Each cell in the UC layer represents a composite image in order that the extended model can recall the whole image if only part of a composite image is presented we introduce recurrent connections from the uc layer to layer UcL for each connection from UCL to UC Fukushima proposed an extended model of the Neocognitron which can exhibit association 151 The association proposed in this paper differs from his in that our association is among different patterns and his association is within a single pattern Association appears if and only if there is no firing cell in layer UC and no new cell is created This occurs when the current input image is a part of some stored image In this case the system associates the current image with the whole stored image Because an image is formed when a number of input patterns are presented concurrently it is possible that a certain input image is contained by more than one stored image A competition appears among these stored images to select only one image. Two factors are considered crucial for this kind of competition 1 how much the stored images resemble the current image 2 how often the stored images have been presented before Let Q1,12  In represent the set of competing composite images We measure 9 Where t\(I$ is the number of times that image Ii has been presented before Hence we can find an Ik such that strength 2 strength i  1  n and input\(Ik will be recalled in layer UCL Computer Simulation The extended Neocognitron model with the mechanisms for pattern partitioning and pattern composition was simulated on a Sun workstation The originally implemented Neocognitron was a seven layered network UO~US~~UC~~US~-SUC~~US~~UC In this simulation we implemented a four layered 11-27 1 


network UC~US~+UC-+UC where layer UC is the new layer added for pattern composition.

Three features are detected in layer UC and pattern 10 and 2 activate two cells in Uc3 respectively and pattern composition only appear in the last layer Another simplification is that we only implemented four planes in each layer We assume that during the training stage two training patterns 10 and 2 shown in the upper layer of Fig3 are presented repeatedly in layer U0 and stored in the modifiable synaptic weights We assume further that three features l 0 2 are recognized respectively by the first three C-planes in Uc2 as shown in Fig.3 In Fig.4 we test a main feature of the Neocognitron shift-invariance Pattern 2 is presented at four different positions of the input layer.

The pattern 102 was presented earlier and stored as a composite image Now 0 and 10 are presented As shown in the Figure no cell in Uc fires because these patterns are not whole composite patterns However these patterns activate the association process The whole stored pattern 102 is recalled in layer Uc3 Discussion The proposed extension to the Neocognitron based on two neuronal growth rules provides a mechanism for pattern recognition and self-organization in the brain Generally speaking, the neuron splitting rule implements a mechanism for specialization of general pattern 11-272

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
