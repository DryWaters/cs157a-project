Association rules is an important research branch of the data mining field, its main purpose is to discover interesting and hidden association or correlation between the properties from large data sets. The core issue of association rules is how to find all frequent items from database quickly Mining association rules 2 is divided into two steps First step: find all frequent items, that is ,find all itemsets that is greater or equal to a given minimum support degree The second step: generate the strong rules from frequent items, that is ,find out association rules which meet the Minsup and Minconf. Therefore Mining association rules focus on  reducing the number of candidate sets. The traditional  mining association rules is Apriori algorithm 3  Apriori algorithm is the most influential algorithm which mining Boolean association rules, it uses iterative search layer by layer, from 1 to k-frequent items through recursive search In recent years, a lot of studies show that Concept lattice 4 is an effective tool for analyzing ang extracting rules. Concept lattice, also known as formal concept analysis, is a concept hierarchy established by a binary relation based on objects and properties. each node of concept lattice is a formal concept, consists two parts: the extension of the concept, said to belong to the set of all objects ; the content of the concept, meaning that the total common properties of these objects. Quantitative Concept Lattice 5 is to quantify the extension of the concept lattice ignoring the specific information of the extension .In addition, the concept lattice reflects generalization and specialization lively and simply between these concepts by Hasse figure. In the field of knowledge discovery, concept lattice \(a core data structure in the form of a concept analysis\ can be constructed from relational data, then extracted various knowledge, such as implication rules association rules, classification rules and so on In this paper, we first discuss the Apriori algorithm and find the problems  in the mining  the association rules Then, we introduce a method of mining association rules based on Quantitative Concept Lattice, It uses a different structure, so greatly improve the efficiency of mining II B ACKGROUND ON Q UANTITATIVE C ONCEPT L ATTICE AND A SSOCIATION R ULE Definition  1 I is a itemset, I={i1,i2 in},D is a set of all transaction, T is a subset of I T  I, each transaction identify with an only sign TID, Association rule is the form X=>Y X  I Y  I and X Y=ø,X is called the condition of the rule,Y is called the result of the rule Definition 2.

Support Degree 8 Support degree represent the frequency of the rule, minimum support referred to Minsup. Support\(X=>Y\= P\(X Y Confidence Degree 8 Confidence degree represent the strength of the rule, minimum confidence referred to Minconf ,Confidence X=>Y P Y|X Support X Y Support X Frequent itemsets: If the support degree of transaction X is not less than the Minsup, then X is frequent itemset Association rules mining is to find the rules that meet a certain minimum degree  and the Minsup. For example, the minimum support count is 2,and there are 5 transaction the Minsup=2/5=40 III A SSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON A PRIORI ALGORITHM The classical Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal e.g.It is the most influential algorithm for mining frequent item sets, the algorithm adopt iterative search layer by layer: First, find the frequent set L1 which has only one item, then find the frequent item L2 which has two items based on L1,and so on, until you can not find frequent item Lk which has K items The basic idea of Apriori algorithm is 1 By scanning the database, generate a large set of candidate item and calculate the number of each candidate set ,then, based on the given Minsup generate a itemsets of frequent 1-item ,denoted by L1 2 Based on L1and the other data,generate a itemsets of frequent 2-item ,denoted by L2 3 Similarly, until generate a itemsets of frequent kitem,which can no longer generate the \(k+1\item meet the Minsup 4 Finally, derive the association rule from large data A The Apriori algorithm description Input: database D,Minsup Output:the frequent item L Begin  L1=find-frequent-1-itemset D  for\(K=2;Lk-1 k  Ck=apriori-gen\(Lk-1,min-sup  for each transaction t D  Ct=subset\(Ck,t  for each candidate c Ct  c.count    Lk={c Ck|c.count min-sup    return L kLk The most critical step of The Apriori algorithm is how to find out frequent item. Using the following specific example , We can see how to mining association rules in database.There is 5 transcation, that is|D|=5,we use the Table 1 to interpret that how to find out frequent item.We assume that the minimum transaction support count is 2,and the Minsup=2/5=40 B Sample Description TABLE 1 THE DATA IN THE TRANSACTION DATABASE Tid Item sets  T1 ABDE T2 BD T3 BC T4 ABD T5 AC Scanning the database, and count for each candidate\(Table 2 TABLE 2 THE CANDIDATE 1 ITEM AND THE SUPPORT DEGREE item Support degree A} 3 B} 4 C} 2 D} 3 E} 1 Compare the support degree of candidate item with the Minsup, if it is less than 2, will remove from the table\(Table 3 TABLE 3 THE CANDIDATE 1ITEM AND THE SUPPORT DEGREE item Support degree A} 3 B} 4 C} 2 D} 3 Based on Table 3 and scanning the database ,we can generate 2-item and count for the number and compare the support degree of 2-item with the Minsup , if it is less than 2, will remove  from the table\(Table 4 TABLE 4 THE CANDIDATE 2ITEM AND THE SUPPORT DEGREE Item set Support degree A,B} 2 B,D} 3 Based on Table 4 and scanning the database,we can generate 3-item and count for the number and compare the support degree of 3-item with the Minsup , if it is less than 2, will remove  from the table\(Table 5 1338 


TABLE 5 THE CANDIDATE 3ITEM AND THE SUPPORT DEGREE Item set Support degree  A,B,D} 2 Above all,we find out the frequent item {A,B,D},we can see that during the process, access the database repeatly.If the number of the database is very large, the efficiency will be greatly reduced IV A SSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON Q UANTITATIVE C ONCEPT L ATTICE The Apriori algorithm has the following problems:1 There are a lot of redundant rules; 2\ Computation of rule mining is increasing exponentially, thus the rules surge in the number submitted to users, and the users extract frequent items that will be more difficult. the method Association rules mining based on Quantitative Concept Lattice described in this paper can effectively solve these issues A The algorithm about constructing Quantitative Concept Lattice and extracting Association rules 9 1 The algorithm description about constructing Quantitative Concept Lattice  Input a.

V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we give a lot of table to interpret how to find out the frequent items ,which is the most important in mining the association rules. So, the method is very vital.The Traditional Apriori algorithm is inappropriate in large database, it access the database frequently ,if the data is large,the efficiency is reduced Above all, Association rules mining based on Quantitative Concept Lattice is a simple and intuitive way and compare to Apriori algorithm, the method solves the redundancy of the non-frequent which in the Aprior algorithm, the data mining efficiency is improved Therefore the method is suitable for mining in large databases.However ,if there are a lot of itemsets, the scale of constructing Quantitative Concept Lattice will be larger Of course, in future work, Association rules mining based on Quantitative Concept Lattice also need to improve, make more efficiency in data mining,for example,we can prune to the Hasse Figure,reduce redundancy and so on References 1 A gr aw a l R I m ie l i ns k i T S w am iA Mini n g as s o c i a tio n r u l e s  between sets of items in large databases[DB OL p    ci te s e e r n j.nec. com/agraual93. htm. l , 2002-04-10 2 H a n J W  K a m b er M  D a t a  m i n i n g  c o n c ept s and t ech ni qu es M     San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2001. 227- 236 3 K eW ang YuHe JiaweiHan.

A 0.520  The analytical result shows a heavy dependence of electricity consumption, and hence the power load growth, on industrial output value and per capita GDP Total value of imports and exports, income, nonagricultural population and total investment in fixed assets are found out as the sub-dominant factors to growth in electricity Weather conditions in summer influence peak load level, along with the proliferation of air conditioning load. Peak summer temperature is thus found relevant to some extent as well. The remaining 18 candidate variables, therefore, are suggested to be ignored in power load analysis and forecast V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have introduced a new data mining methodology to investigate association degrees between Chinese power load growth and 27 different candidate factors This methodology offers some advantages as, for example allowing us to properly extract interesting association rules from large historical database. By ordering confidence of selected rules, four dominant factors and five sub-dominant factors boosting the electricity consumption in China are identified, which can been adopted for better understanding the growth law and more accurately predicting the electricity demand Future work includes the development of a new prediction 


method for electricity demand using the dominant variables identified in this research as inputs.

means that the service is in the same branch, but at a lower level in the hierarchy of services execution. Therefore, this service will only be conducted if an error has occurred in the execution of the previous one. As shown in chart II the latter service uses an image resource in charge of showing some information at the MIDlet display and whose content is also stored on the device Besides, the MIDlet allows in a simple way to modify all those parameters that define the execution of the services and their use. As commented before, a user could not want that a service is executed automatically and requires manual confirmation. For that, he/she only would need to change the value of the execution parameter of the service into manual. In the same way, the user can activate or deactivate the use of resources just by modifying the value of the state attribute into off. Even more, it is possible to add new resources, if, together with their definition some content needed for their execution is included Therefore, it can be checked as, even when the user define an initial interaction for a scenario and even when the same deployment is done in different devices, each user could easily adapt and customize the interaction to its needs and preferences afterwards Equally, the user could activate or deactivate a service changing the execution order and modifying the hierarchy initially defined for them. Herewith, the same scenario could be customized and act in a different way depending of the person that interacts with it V. DISCUSSION IoT is not a reality yet, but a prospective view of a series of technologies that, combined, could sharply modify the interaction mode with our environment and the working of our society in the following years. In order to establish the IoT philosophy, it would be needed an advance of the development and dissemination of elements as sensors, new communication technologies \(as well as their intercommunication mobile devices able to integrate them, a proper infrastructure and above all software applications that supports them and are able to integrate all those elements, as well as to fulfills the needs and requirements of the users Those new systems must also be adapted to the different interaction scenarios and, mainly, to the different 


characteristics, requirements, preferences and needs of the people that interact with the environment. In this paper we present a model that provides a solution to this issue The model is based in augment different objects among a scenario with Tags, by the assignment of services and resources defined in an abstracted hierarchy that allows configuring a customized interaction model. Thus, for the same scenario, the model is able to define different interaction contexts. So, a context is defined as the aggregation of: a certain scenario formed by a set of intelligent objects offering a set of services, b characteristics, preferences and needs, c and d Under the proposed model a tool that allows the definition and scenario deployment has been built. A neuter MIDlet installed in the NFC device is the one in charge of guiding the 13 interaction through the definition of the scenarios stored in a XML file. This architecture allows that the same MIDlet could be used with any scenario and that the user could adapt the interaction to his preferences Currently we are working in the completeness of the model and the complex interaction scenarios generalization, being the latter based in rules systems that allows adapting the different interaction contexts to the users ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain \(MICINN Project TIN2009-07184 REFERENCES 1] M.

dataset contains a stream of TCP connection records from two weeks of LAN traffic over MIT Lincoln Labs. It consists of 42 attributes that usually characterize network traffic behavior, both categorical attributes and quantitative attributes such as duration of the connections, protocol type etc. Attribute src_byte denoting the number of data bytes from source to destination and attribute dst_bytes inverse are selected in this experiment.  They are both quantitative attributes The user specified parameters are set as follows 5, 0.3, 0.03, 0.01,W min_sup preMinsup T 0.5, 0.4, 30.min_confidence max_MFB min_num_triples And the number of transactions in each time slot is 250 It is assumed that there are no more than three fuzzy sets or intervals in the datasets i.e. 3F Four different approaches to mine association rules are compared using the following notations: Fuzzy+MFB: the approach that use both fuzzy method and MFB_measure with 1 3.0? = and 2 0 .5 2 0.5? = , Fuzzy+P: the approach using fuzzy method with 1 3.0? = and 2 0.5? = also but repressing the first part of the MFB_measure that ignores the changed rate of the membership function, Discrete1: the approach using discrete method with 1 2 1.5? ?= =  and Discrete2 : the approach using discrete method with 1 2 2.5 TABLE I.

Comparison of Execution Time Fig. 3 shows the execution time of the four approaches The runtimes of them grow linearly as the data stream grows which confirms that they are scalable with respect to the size of data stream, and it is mainly because of the usage of sliding window model. Fuzzy+P uses the least time Fuzzy+MFB has similar execution time to Discrete2, and Discrete1 has the most execution time. The difference of runtimes between them is mainly influenced by the clustering operations they use. The more clustering operations were executed, the more runtime it was Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the number of frequent itemsets and interesting rules found with the data stream increased Fuzzy+P and Fuzzy+MFB used less clustering operations than Discrete1 and Discrete2. Fuzzy+MFB nearly finds the most number of frequent fuzzy sets and interesting rules with the second least of clustering operations. Sometimes Discrete2 returns nearly the same number of fuzzy sets and interesting rules but with more clustering operations and the 


semantics of Discrete2 are meaningless as discussed in experiment one. Furthermore, the number of interesting rules found by Discrete1 is even less than Fuzzy+P that used the clustering operations least which illustrates the superiority of the method using fuzzy sets V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel fuzzy ARM algorithm called FFI_Stream is presented to tackle quantitative attributes in data streams and some techniques are proposed in the algorithm. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures. Figure 1 b cost for the sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
