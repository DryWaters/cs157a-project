Boolean Matrix based approach has been employed to generate frequent itemsets in multidimensional transaction databases. It adopts Boolean relational calculus to discover frequent predicate sets. When using this algorithm first time, it scans the database once and will generate the association rules Apriori property is used in algorithm to prune the item sets. It is not necessary to scan the database again; it uses Boolean logical operations to generate the association rules. We illustrate the implementati on of algorithm with the help of a simple example Keywords- Boolean matrix; hybrid dimensional association rule relational calculus; multidimensional transaction  database  I  I NTRODUCTION  Mining association rules in transactional or relational database is an important task in data mini  The association rules are for discovering the interesting association relationships among huge amounts of business transaction records An association rule is an implication of the form A  B where A  I  B  I and A  B   The rule A  B holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A  B i.e., the union of sets A and B or say, both A and B This is taken to be the probability P  A  B The rule A  B has confidence c in the transaction set D where c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B This is taken to be the conditional probability P  B  A That is      B A P B A Support          A B P B A Confidence    Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold min sup minimum confidence threshold min conf re called strong T he support defined in the equation given below is referred to relative support whereas the occurrence frequency is called the absolute suppor e set  o f  frequent k itemsets is commonly denoted by L K            A Support B A Support A B P B A Confidence      Association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process 1. Find all frequent itemsets: Each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predetermined minimum support count min sup  2  Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets: These rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence min_conf   Among them searching for frequent itemsets is the key step Because itês easy to generate rules from frequent itemsets R Agrawal  and some others  presented the algorithm for mining the simplest form of association rules   The Apriori algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal and R Srikant [2   Apriori e m ploy s a n iterativ e app r o ach kn own as a level-wise search, where k itemsets are used toexplore  k 1\-itemsets. Apriori principle: If an itemset is requent then all of its subsets must also be frequent. It works in two steps Join Step C k is generated by joining L k-1 with itself  Prune Step Any \(k-1\mset that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent k-itemset  C k Candidate itemset of size k and L k frequent itemset of size k  Moreover, it is necessary to repeatedly scan the database for finding frequent itemsets. Therefore the run-time of the Apriori will increase by index grade with the increase of transaction item quantity Association rules can be classified as single-dimensional association rules and multidimensional association rules on the basis of dimension appearing in rules. In multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. Hence, we can refer to buys \(X Digital camera    buys \(X, çHP Printer is a single dimensional or intra-dimensional association rule because it contains a single distinct predicate \(e.g buys th multiple occurrences \(i.e., the predicate occurs more than once within the rule\ion rules that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multidimensional association rules age\(X , "20    occupation \(X , "student    buys \(X , "laptop  contains three predicates age, occupation and buys h of which occurs only once in the rule. Hence, we say that it has no repeated Mul ti d i m e n s i o na l association rules with no repeated predicates are called inter-dimensional association rules. We can also mine multidimensional association rules with repeated predicates which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates These rules are called hybrid-dimensional association rules Volumn 2  978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEE C 


 645 In this the mining of single-dimensional association rule and non-repetitive predicate multi-dimensional association rule are integrated. We propose an algorithm for mining of hybrid-dimensional association rule using Boolean matrix  It mines hybrid-dimension association rules from multidimensional transaction database. We  set definite condition that restricts to the hybrid-dimension association rules mined When we design the hybrid dimension association rule mining algorithm, we stress on the extension and improvement of the Apriori Algorithm the simple Single-dimensional mining algorithm. Therefore, the following text will give a brief analysis to the Apriori II  T HE APRIORI ALGORITHM  The classical Apriori algorithm  em plo y an iter ative method to find all the freq uent iemsets. First, the frequent 1itemsets L 1  is found according to the user-specified minimum support threshold, then the L 1  is used to find frequent 2-iemsets L 2  and so on, until there is no new frequent itemsets could be found. After finding all the frequent itemsets using Apriori, we could generate the corresponding association rules, according to the second step in the process of association rules mining Thus we find the association relationships among transaction items [1 The conditional restrict is: in the rules, the predicates represent the main attribute \(the attribute refers to the transaction itemset\ can occur many times, but the other predications refer to subordinate attributes \(some other relevant attributes\ once [6 o re to achieve our aim, we design an algorithm for mining hybrid-dimension association rules, which meet the definite condition, from multidimensional transaction database III  CONDITIONAL HYBRID DIMENSION ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  The generation of frequent itemsets is the core of all the association rules mining algorithms. Previous studies on mining multi-dimensional association rules we focused on finding non-repetitive predicate multi- dimensional rules We integrate the single-dimensional mining and nonrepetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid-dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix A  The join process There are two steps in generation of the frequent itemsets and frequent predicate sets. The two steps are joining and  pruning  1\The join generating candidate 2-itemsets C 2    We find frequent 1-itemsest based on each attribute, at the same time we mark items belong to every main attribute So it will be clear that the marked items are the items of main attribute and unmarked items are the subordinate items When we search for C2 if both of the two joining items are marked items, we call the function for intra-dimensional join between the items as well as inter-dimensional join, but only proceed with inter-dimensional join on the other occasions 2\in on other occasions When we generate frequent itemsets directly according to the join mode of the Apriori, it would occur intradimensional join as well as inter-dimensional join. But there are some restrictions to the generation of intradimensional join and inter-dimensional join. Therefore we make the following modifications to the joining step of the Apriori  We assume that items within transaction and itemset are sorted in lexicographic order. We could take two steps to find Lk    Distinguish the intra-dimensional join and interdimensional join; If all the items within the two \(k-1\itemsets  belong to the main attribute; we proceed with intra-dimensional join, and proceed with interdimensional join on other occasions   Implement join L k -1  L k -1   and choose the corresponding  joining condition according to the characteristic of the join \(intra-dimensional join or inter-dimensional join    B  The conditional restriction in hybrid-dimension association rules First the frequent itemsets are obtained, and then we generate the hybrid-dimension association rules from the frequent itemsets. In the process of generating frequent itemsets we make both intra-dimensional join and inter-dimensional join as well as the conditional restrictions while proceeding with join, all of the frequent itemsets have such a character: the values within main attribute field occur many times, while the values within subordinate attribute fields occur only once. Thus the  rules generated by the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed IV  DEFINITIONS  A  Association Rules Definition 1  Let I = {i 1 i 2 i 3 i n be a set of items. D is a database of transactions.  Each transaction T is a set of items and has an identifier called TID. Each T    Definition 2   Association rule is the implication of the form A  B where A and B are itemsets which satisfies A  I B  I and A   B   Definitio 3   The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its Support and Confidence   A  B is true in D with a support \(denoted by sup and a confidence denoted by conf  where A and B are  set of items. Support sup is a percentage of transactions including both A and B A  B in transaction sets D Confidence conf is a percentage of transactions including both A and  A  B in transactions that contain A  sup P A  B  conf P B  A  P A  B  Definition 4 Boolean Matrix: is a matrix with element è0ê or 1 Definition 5 The Boolean AND operation is defined as follows:      0.0=0 0.1=0 1.0=0 1.1=1 Where logical Volumn 2

Truth  table for AND will be  A B C=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 Definition 6 The Boolean èAND calculusê is carried out to an arbitrary k columns vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of è1ê of the operation result is called k- support of the k columns vector  Proposition 1   If the sum of è1ê in a column vector A i is less than min_sup_num, it is not necessary that A i will attend calculus of the next level supports Rationale  According to the principle of the Boolean AND calculus, the result is è1ê when the value of all vector elements \(in a record Proposition 2   Itemset A is a k-itemsets \(each item belongs to different dimension/attribute\L K-1 j\| presents the number of values in a dimension/attribute èjê in all frequent k-1\itemsets of the frequent set L K-1 There is an item j in X. If  |L K-1 j\s smaller than k-1, itemset X is not a frequent items   V  METHOD  Let D is a multi-dimensional transactional database  m  n  and min_sup is the minimum support of D. The minimum support number min_sup_num can be defined as min_sup_num= min_sup   m [8   Dimensions, which are also called predications, attributes or fields, constitute a dimension combination with a formula d  d  dn  in which  dj represents  j dimension The i  record can be expressed as value combination with a formula vi vi  vin where vij represents j-th value in i-th record    i  m    j   n The form dj vij is called an çitemé in relational database or other multidimensional data sets, which is denoted by  Iij That is Iij  dj vij  where   i  m    j   n  Among the n attributes, \(n-1\ attributes are subordinate attributes and attribute is the main attribute A set constituted by some çitem Iij is called itemseté. The çitemseté which may consist of the items from subordinate attributes or main attribute only or from subordinate and main attributes The Boolean AND operation is carried out to an arbitrary n column vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of 1ês of the operation result is called n-support of the n column vector VI  ALGORITHM  The algorithm consists of following steps 1  Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into two Boolean matrices one for subordinate attributes \(A m*p and one for main attribute \(A m*q  2  Generating the set of frequent 1-itemset L A1 from the subordinate attributes matrix\ and L B1 from the main attribute matrix 3  Pruning the Boolean matrices 4  Perform AND operations to generate 2-itemsets L A1   L B1 and L A1    L A1 for inter-dimension join and L B1   L B1 for intra-dimension join 5  Repeat the process to generate \(k+1\itemsets from L k  A. Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into Boolean matrix The multidimensional transaction database D has m records and n dimensions. Each dimension has different value combinations or categories. To extract such patterns from the database, the categorical and symmetric binary attributes are transformed into çitems  This ty pe  of  transformation can be performed by creating a new item for each distinct attribute-value pair. Then association rule mining algorithm can be applied. If there are k value combinations in a dimension then k\(k-1\/2 binary items will be created We set up separate Boolean matrix for subordinate attributes and main attribute. A Boolean matrix A m*p which has m \(records or transactions\rows and p \(for \(n-1 subordinate attributes values\ columns and another Boolean matrix B m*q which has m \(records or transactions\ rows and q \(for \(n th main attributes values\ columns. For each transaction in subordinate attributes matrix, only one category of each dimension contains the value 1, rest will contain 0. Whereas in main attribute matrix there can be more than one category have value 1 in a transaction  B.  Generating the frequent 1-itemset L 1 The Boolean matrices A m*p and B m*q are scanned and support numbers of all dimension values are computed. The Support number I j Sup_num,  of I j is the number of 1sê in the j th column of the Boolean matrix. If I j sup_num is smaller than min_sup_num, itemset I j is not a frequent 1-itemset and the j th column will be deleted from the matrix  Otherwise itemset I j is the frequent 1-itemset and is added to frequent one itemset list L 1   C.  Pruning the Boolean matrix  P runing the Boolean matrix means deleting some columns from it. This is described in detail as: Let I be the set of all items in the frequent set   L K-1 where k>2 Compute all     |L K-1 j\| where j  I, and delete the column of correspondence item j if |L K-1 j\| is smaller than min_sup_num  D. Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets L k Frequent k-itemsets are discovered by AND relational calculus, which is carried out for the k-vectors combination If the Boolean matrix A p*q has q columns where 2 n and min_sup_num is  h pm, \(C q  k combinations of k-vectors will be produced. The AND relational calculus is for each Volumn 2 


 647 combination of k-vectors. If the sum of elementês values in the èANDê calculation result is not smaller than the minimum support number min_sup_num the k-itemsets corresponding to this combination of k-vectors are the frequent k-itemsets and are added to the set of frequent kitemsets L k The rules generated from the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed VII   I LLUSTRATIVE E XAMPLE  We integrate the single-dimensional mining and nonrepetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid- dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix Let a multi-dimensional transaction database Order which includes two subordinate attributes Age and Income and one main attribute Ordered_items as given below TABLE II. ORDER               In order to simplify the implement process, we preprocessed some attributes before algorithm executes, shown below TABLE III. Mapping Age TABLE IV. Mapping Income  TABLE V.  ORDER             The multidimensional transaction table Order is transformed into two Boolean Matrices: A m*p as subordinate attributes matrix and B m*q as main attribute matrix. Which are as given below Let the minimum support is 0.4; m=10 is the number of transactions. Therefore min_sup_num=10  0.4=4.0. We compute the sum of the elements value of each column in the Boolean matrix A 10*5 and B 10*5 set of frequent 1-itemset is :    L A1 y},{m},{h},{l}},  L B1 I1},{I2},{I3},{I5 smaller than the minimum support number. Now we perform the èANDê operation to join L A1 and L B1 according to the type of join\ to generate L 2  The possible 2-itemsets  are Inter-dimensional join \(L A1   L B1 and L A1    L A1  It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix A m*p AND B m*q and A m*p AND A m*p Intra-dimensional join \(L B1  L B1   It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix B m*p AND B m*q The possible 2-itemsets from L A1 and L B1 l,2 m,3\\(m,5 I1,I2\\(I1,I3\\(I1,I5\,\(I2,I3\,\(I2,I5\\(I3,I5 After performing   èANDê  operation to get the support numbers of these mentioned item sets the Boolean matrices A 10*18 and B 10*6 are generated Now again we compute the sum of the columns of matrices A 10*18 and B 10*6 And prune the columns of the 2-itemsets those are not frequent. Same process will be repeated till for next higher itemsets  Figure 1. shows the process of searching for frequent itemsets in detail. In the figure, we pruned the candidates generated in each level. For each generated frequent itemset, we find that it should meet the characteristics of the frequent itemsets that are generated by hybrid-dimension association rules mining algorithm Therefore, we can easily generate corresponding hybriddimension association rules from the frequent itemsets generated by the algorithm. For example:  In figure 8, {m, h I1, I2:4} is a frequent itemset. We can generate such a hybrid-dimension association rule  2 1 I I h m    Support=40% and Confidence=100  Figure 1.

 648 hybrid-dimension association rules on multidimensional transaction database by means of the Boolean Matrix Based algorithm VIII  EXPERIMENT  To test whether the proposed method is fast, expansible and effective our experiments are made on machine with Intel\(R\ Core 2Duo, 1.5GHz and 1GB memory. The operating system is Windows XP. We use a database that has 500 records and 5 attributes, which have 2~8 different values/categories  Fig 2. Execution Time with different record numbers  IX   RESULT  AND  DISCUSSION The confidence of association rules has a specific meaning when the antecedent of the rule is satisfied, the consequent of the rule will have c here c refers to the confidence of the rule\ossibility of being satisfied. In association rules only in the antecedent part of multidimensional association rules include several predictions at the same time. We can say that the result of prediction on multidimensional association rules is better and more precise than on singledimensional association rules. For example, TABLEI presents a multidimensional transaction database Order If we make a single dimensional association analysis on the predicate Ordered_items which presents itemsets in transaction, the result of analysis will only include the relevance of Order itemsets. But  if we make a hybriddimension association analysis, the result of analyzing not only includes the relevance of Order itemsets, but also includes the relevance of customersê information, eg Age Income Thus when we proceed with predictions on the product order of customersê by means of the result of association analysis, obviously, the conditions included in the antecedent of multidimensional association rules is more abundant, and will bring better prediction result X    CONCLUSION The proposed algorithm uses Boolean matrix and meet the definite condition to generate conditional-hybrid dimensional association rules, from multidimensional transactional database. The main features are: it scans the database only once, it does not generate the candidate item sets, and it uses the Boolean vector çrelational calculusé to generate frequent item sets. It stores data in the form of bits so it needs less memory space and can be applied to large relational databases. T he further work is to optimize the algorithm, and increase the efficiency of the algorithm  R EFERENCES  1  R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.

In this section we present algorithms based on the BIAS framework for the three FFT-pattern variants described in section 3.2 in section 4.2 Since there is no relaxation on the number of supporting is unique i.e the set of all transactions containing at least Given itemset iterations The complexity is see Example 5 This statistic can be maintained concurrently with the former therefore the additional cost needed is constant The support of an itemset can be calculated by summing from index in bitmap is set if and only if transaction represents the ratio between bit-wise and integer operations which is roughly 1/32 in a 32 bits processor where 32 operations can be performed in one clock cycle for down to 0 bitmaps in all recurrence levels In this case the maximum space allocated is like approach FT-Apriori 336rst 336nds all frequent itemsets with size  time The number of candidates generated in this approach is relatively small compared to that in backtracking However generation of the candidates itself is an expensive process consuming most of the mining time Another disadvantage 
These aggregation statistics can be maintained ef\336ciently Since we are using a backtracking algorithm at most one item is added or removed at one time Thus in the worst case this operation needs Recalling the de\336nition a pattern   These two variables can be used interchangeably since the number of appearances equals the size of the itemset less the number of es For the sake of ef\336ciency we use the number of appearances as the aggregation statistic  one way to calculate its frequency is by maintaining the number of of each transaction denoted as is the last added item in the backtracking step can be maintained by increasing the count of all transactions containing in the expected case where  which stores the number of transactions for every distinct value in iterations for each update and By sacri\336cing space we can reduce  it generates candidates of size whose  the algorithm checks whether all its subsets are frequent in O  time and then veri\336es whether is frequent in another pass of the database taking O

Approach  Space  of this approach is that it needs another database pass while processing itemsets of each size Koh and Yo presented VB-FT-Mine which uses a backtracking technique similar to ours However instead of using an aggregation statistic they analyzed the recurrence relation of the support-tidset Let to be contained in at least supporting transactions Our technique can easily be adjusted to this requirement by iterating each item denotes the total number of frequent itemsets and the constant pattern problem since each itemset might have multiple support-tidsets Since the approach used in FFT pattern can be applied to handle the transaction relaxation  Therefore 336nding the largest sized support-tidset can verify whether the pattern is frequent This problem can be expressed as the is at most as dif\336cult as generating S  While it may seem easier we show that 336nding the maximum result in problem Lemma 2 Finding maximum 001 is to 336nd a maximum set of vertices such that there is no edge between any pair of them The reduction is as follows For every edge  add inequality  This reduction is complete since the result of will be the maximum set of variables vertices which are not connected Since this case is a subset of Since this problem is NP-Complete we cannot expect to have a practically ef\336cient solution unless As in section 4.2 we reduce the number of variables by 336nding the equivalence classes In this variant two transactions are equivalent

 The time and space comple xity of VB-FT Mine is exactly the same as ours using bitmap This algorithm is fast because the recurrence relation happens to be simple and using bitmaps is ef\336cient Both approaches limit each item  as is done in and 6 Ho we v er  this constraint is neglected for the sake of consistency among all variants discussed in this paper A summary comparison among these three approaches is presented in Table 1 Our approaches representing the aggregation statistic as appearances and bitmaps are characterized by BIAS\(appear and BIAS\(bit respectively N represents the ratio of time taken for bit operations to integer operations which in this case is roughly 1/32 Table 1 shows that no approach is totally superior compared to others Given a sparse database and large tolerance appear seems promising while  These results must be viewed in light of the main focus of this paper which is to mine the statistical information of support-tidsets This variant is incorporated to illustrate how the BIAS framework handles the criterion of transaction relaxation pattern is de\336ned as a pattern that satis\336es the criteria of item relaxation  Clearly 336nding the maximum sized S is an NP-Complete in a graph which is a well-known NP-complete problem problem is at least as hard as MIS  Proving the completeness of its decision-problem  001 k i 1 if they contain exactly the same itemset in is obtained section 4.2 we can calculate the desired statistic using equation 6

Since this variant hasn\325t been mentioned previously we can\325t compare the ef\336ciency of BIAS with any other approach However the experimental results in a practicalsized dataset indicate that this algorithm is ef\336cient and scalable Figure 2\(f shows that the time needed is approximately linear to the number of frequent itemsets The number of frequent itemsets itself scales similar to classical frequent-itemsets which grows exponentially as the density increases and/or as the minimum support decreases In this problem the number of frequent itemsets is also much smaller compared to FFT pattern For example in database with 4 density and 0.5 minimum support with  the proportion is 46K frequent itemsets to 637K FFT-patterns which is around 7 As seen in Figure 2\(g the ratio becomes smaller as increases and minimum support decreases Similar to the previous problem the value of We have generalized the problem of mining 336xed-value FFT-patterns into relaxation criteria and constraints and have shown that these criteria and constraints can be used to derive several available variants of FFT-patterns as well as many new de\336nitions For FFT-patterns mining in transactional database we proposed to mine only statistical information of the corresponding FFT-patterns and we have shown with several experiments that such statistics are suf\336cient to describe the characteristic of an itemset We have developed a new framework called BIAS framework for mining FFT-patterns based on backtracking algorithm ILP constraints and aggregation statistics We have also shown that this framework can be used to ef\336ciently mine several variants of FFT-patterns For future work we plan to analyze the utility of statistical information in real world data We are also interested in analyzing the impact of each relaxation criteria and in researching the problem using proportional relaxation This technique may also be applied to other problems such as sequential mining stream mining and graph mining

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
