A cryptographic approach for monitoring patients with mild cognitive\nimpairment and dementia\nConstantinos Patsakis\nDistributed Systems Group, School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College, Dublin Ireland\npatsakik@scss.tcd.ie\nAbstract\nModern technological advances have enabled us to im-\nprove the quality of our lives, increasing the life expectancy\nas well, in almost every developed country. Therefore, a big\npart of the population, has reached older age. As a result,\nmild cognitive impairment and several types of dementia,\nare becoming a serious problem. Apart from medical care\nsolutions, others are proposing modern technology based\nsolutions. Patients are using geolocation devices, allow-\ning tracing in case they have an accident, get lost or sim-\nply disoriented. Nevertheless, in the first stages cognitive\nimpairment is not so dangerous, so patients have a high\ndegree of autonomy. Forcing them to carry such devices,\nsurely invades their privacy. This work proposes a novel,\nmore privacy-aware method for sharing patient’s informa-\ntion using cryptographic primitives\n1 Introduction\nThe increasing life expectancy in the developed coun-\ntries coupled with the huge population growth, has led\nmodern societies to an unprecedented state where a very\nsignificant amount of people are over aged. A very sensi-\ntive group among these people suffer from mild cognitive\nimpairment and dementia. Apart from the special care that\nis needed for the elderly, these people need additional care,\nas gradually they are losing control of their self.\nThis situation has created a new market for products that\ntarget this group and their needs. The biggest part of this\nmarket is focusing on providing proper medicines. How-\never, since taking care of such patients can be very difficult\nwithin small families or in urban areas, care services and\nspecial care houses have been created.\nThe wide endorsement of technology in developed coun-\ntries from all age groups, have enabled the creation of de-\nvices aiming to provide monitoring services for patients\nwho are at early stages and can be regarded quite au-\ntonomous. All these devices have an embedded GPS mech-\nanism allowing them to transmit the location of the patient\nto legitimate carers. More advanced devices, can transmit\nother vital information, like heartbeat rate. Based on this\ninformation, proper alarms can triggered, informing author-\nities, carers or legally responsive for the patient entities, to\nproceed to some actions.\nObviously, even if patients agree to use them, their pri-\nvacy is violated. They sacrifice their privacy in exchange\nof the right to move. The continuous monitoring coupled\nwith the fact that these patients are very autonomous in the\nearly stages, makes them in many cases deny these solu-\ntions. In this context this work introduces a novel frame-\nwork for monitoring patients with mild cognitive impair-\nment and dementia using smart phones. The framework\nprovides a more privacy aware solution, based on timed re-\nlease cryptography, allowing only authenticated by the pa-\ntient entities to access his information. Simultaneously, it\ndoesn’t allow arbitrary monitoring of the patient from the\nauthenticated entities, but only when this is needed ,allow-\ning backtracking, whenever there is a need for that.\nThe rest of this work is organized as follows. The next\nsection provides an overview of solutions and recent ad-\nvances in patient tracking, along with an introduction to\ntimed release encryption. The third section presents the\nproposed solution in terms of which cryptographic mech-\nanisms are used and under which situations. Afterwards,\nwe analyze the main advantages that the proposed method\nis offering and how they contribute to the overall provided\nprivacy. Finally, we end with some conclusions and plans\nfor future work.\n2 Related work\n2.1 Patient tracking\nA typical behavior of patients with cognitive impair-\nments is wandering Even in early stages, patients temporar-\nily might get lost or disoriented, therefore, end up endlessly\n978-1-4799-1053-3/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE502 CBMS 2013\nwandering exposing themselves to serious risks In many\ncases, the carers resort to physically restrict patients mo-\nbility, either by locking doors or by prescribing drugs that\nkeep them sedated [4, 1]. The result in the first case is that\npatients feel more depressed, as not only they have to face\ntheir health problems, but lose their freedom as well. In\nthe latter case, excessive use of drugs degrades significantly\ntheir life quality.\nIn order to provide patients more mobility, without the\nconstant supervision of the carers, the use of mobile phones\nequipped with GPS has been proposed [5]. This allows car-\ners to continuously track multiple patients, facilitating the\ntask of assisting them whenever this is necessary. Obvi-\nously, the patient using such a tracking device gains more\nfreedom of mobility from his carers, nevertheless, his pri-\nvacy is certainly invaded. Many such devices can be found\nin the market nowadays, aiming two target groups, elderly\nand children. However, since it’s a clear violation of some-\none’s privacy, a written consent from the patient is always\nneeded.\nA less privacy pervasive proposal was made by Casas et\nal. in [2]. Instead of constantly tracking the patient, the\ndevice is sending an alarm to the carers, whenever specific\npatterns are detected or actions are made by the patients.\nPatterns that can trigger alarms include proximity to dan-\ngerous areas, vital measurements above specific values.\nRecently researchers proposed a new model for track-\ning patients with more respect towards their privacy [7].\nIn their scheme, patient’s location is and sent to a location\nserver. Depending on the state the m-Carer, the 


application\nthat runs on patient’s smart phone, detects, the location can\nbe sent encrypted or plaintext. In state of critical alarm,\nthe traffic is unencrypted, so that all entities can collabo-\nrate their efforts and provide the needed help to the patient.\nHowever, in case of non-critical event, the information is\nencrypted with a key that is shared only among the carers\nand the legally responsible for the supervision of patient.\nFinally, in normal usage, the information is encrypted so\nthat only a cooperation of a carer and a legally responsive\nentities can decrypt the location of the patient. This ap-\nproach is the least privacy pervasive in literature, neverthe-\nless, the collaboration of two entities, and the disclosure of\none’s key lead to a privacy invasion of the patient. There-\nfore, a more generic approach is proposed, that enables even\nmore freedom to the patient mobility, removes the collabo-\nration restrictions and allows backtracking only when this\nis necessary.\n2.2 Timed Release Encryption\nCryptography provides the necessary mechanisms to al-\nlow secure storage solutions, where only authorized entities\ncan access the content. Currently there are many secure al-\ngorithms, enabling us to efficiently encrypt our data with\nminimal processing cost Simultaneously, they provide the\ncomputational guarantees that the information remain se-\ncure, if the decryption key cannot be extracted.\nNevertheless, in many applications we want to enable\neveryone to access some information after a certain period\nof time. A typical example of such application is a bidding\nprocess where bidders place their bids on the broker, how-\never, they want to disclose their offer when every other bid-\nder has placed his bid and cannot improve it. One solution\nto this problem is using trusted third parties TTP  the more advanced tech-\nniques of Timed Release Encryption \(TRE special class of computational\nproblems that cannot be parallelized, requiring a precise\namount of CPU time to be solved. The non-parallelization\nrequirement prevents entities from using massive process-\ning resources like clusters, when others cannot. Therefore,\nthe problem is more or less of the same difficulty for every\nentity.\nMany time-lock puzzles have been based on the well\nknown RSA encryption algorithm as [6]. The general\nscheme that releases an encrypted message m in T sec-\nonds is the following: First we pick two large prime num-\nbers p and q and calculate their product n and ?\(n p ? 1 q ? 1 TS, where\nS is the maximum number of square operations modulo n\nper second that the potential receivers could perform. Then,\nwe select an encryption algorithm E and a key K and we\nencrypt the message m with algorithm E and key K to ob-\ntain: C = EK\(m publish the\nparameters: \(n, a, t, C,C original message m. To\nachieve this, he has to take a and perform t square opera-\ntions modulo n. The creator of the puzzle has the advantage\nof knowing ?\(n calculations\nefficiently.\nParallelizing this procedure might be possible, neverthe-\nless, any adversary who tries to do it, might gain with the\nprocess speedup, but this will be compensated by the com-\nmunication costs, as the squaring operation is very easy to\nbe implemented. Therefore, each entity will have to use one\nmachine that will be dedicated on solving the puzzle, hence\nthe expected time for disclosure is at least T for every ad-\nversary.\n3 The proposed model\nThe crucial difference in the model compared to any\nother model is that it avoids continuous patient tracking and\nenables patients to have personal passwords, that they don’t\nCBMS 2013 503\nneed to remember, through the use of biometrics. By issu-\ning a time and processing limit that cannot be bypassed, on\nwhen the sensitive information will become available, car-\ners or any other entity are deterred from trying to invade\npatient’s privacy.\nIn our model we have four main entities, the Patient P nthe legally responsive for the patient entity L, the carer C\nand a service provider S. The patient carries a smart phone\nthat is running a special application, whose description is\ngoing to be given afterwards, using the following keys. The\nshort-term storage key of the patientKPS and the long-term\nstorage key of the patient KPL , both for a timed release en-\ncryption algorithm and derived from a biometric measure-\nment of the patient. The keys PPub, Ppriv are patient’s pub-\nlic and private key respectively, used for signing his mes-\nsages. KPS is a key for a symmetric key algorithm, used\nfor exchanging information between P and S. Key KPCL\nis used for a symmetric key algorithm, for exchanging infor-\nmation between P, C and L. Finally, KALL is a key for a\nsymmetric key algorithm, used for exchanging information\nbetween C, P, S and L.\nIn the following we are going to regard the geolocation\nof the patient as the only sensitive information, however,\ndepending on the circumstances and the sensors that the de-\nvice has embedded, other fields can be processed accord-\ningly All P ’s information is gathered by his smart-phone\nand a two phase storage solution is being used Firstly,\nthe information is stored in the temporary cache for short\nterm storage and key KPS is used to encrypt patient’s lo-\ncation. Every message is stored along with its signature\nusing patient’s private key PPriv. After a predefined period\nof time, this information is moved for permanent storage.\nTherefore, KPL is 


applied on the ciphertext and afterwards\nthe key KPC ? KPL, encrypting it for long-term storage.\nThe information can be now be uploaded to a Cloud Ser-\nvice Provider, allowing other parties to access the encrypted\nform of the data. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed storage\nmodel.\nIn the case of alarms, the situation is more or less obvi-\nous. The most clear is the case of a critical alarm. Whenever\na critical alarm is triggered, it means that P is facing a very\nimportant incident that needs immediate response, e.g. a\nlife threatening incident, accident or entry in a very danger-\nous area like a motorway. This incident has to be broad-\ncasted to all the involved entities, therefore, P ’s location is\nencrypted using keyKALL and sent as message toA, S and\nL, along with the respective flags that notify all entities of\nthe problem. P ’s location can in this case be recovered by\nall involved parties easily, so that the proper measures can\nbe taken immediately.\nIn the case of non-critical events, the location of P is sent\nencrypted to C and L, underKPCL Obviously, only C and\nL can decrypt this information and proceed to the required\nLong-term storage \nShort-term nstorage \nTRE \nencryption \nTRE long-term \nencryption \nSplit key \nfor carer  &  \nlegally responsive \nPatient nsigned data \nCSP \nFigure 1. The storage model.\nPatient’s \nkey \nSplit key \nFigure 2. The proposed model.\nactions, without any problem.\nIn both the aforementioned cases, the patient wouldn’t\nhave any problem to disclose his location, as this will help\nhim overcome dangerous or problematic situations. The\nreal discomfort for everyone is disclosing his exact where-\nabouts continuously or arbitrarily, whenever someone else\ndecides to. To counter this problem, the timed release en-\ncryption is used, allowing only authenticated entities to re-\ncover patient’s geolocation, only when this is needed. To\nachieve this, originally, the information is stored using the\nthe short-term storage key KPS inside the smart phone. Af-\nter some predefined period of time the data, the data are en-\ncrypted using KPC ?KPL, which allows only C and L to\naccess this information. Finally, the encrypted data are re-\nencrypted usingKPL and uploaded on a CSP. The proposed\nscheme can be seen in Figure 2.\nKeys KPA, KPCL and KALL allow only the respective\nentities to exchange messages with P ’s device. The use of\ndigital signatures on each message that is stored, prevents\n504 CBMS 2013\nanyone from trying to forge patient’s information\nThe first layer of privacy is the encryption withKPS key.\nLet’s assume that the patient is carrying his smart phone and\nno type of event is triggered. Definitely, this does not mean\nthat the patient does not face any problem, it means that\nsuch a problem is not detected by the system In a hypo-\nthetical scenario, the patient is slightly injured by something\nor someone that he cannot recall The encryption with the\nuse of timed release encryption, allows entities to decrypt\nthe stored information However, since they are not able to\nimmediately decrypt the information or speed up the pro-\ncess, they will result to this action, only if this is needed.\nTherefore, the proposed scheme does not allow anyone to\narbitrarily query the sensitive information. More to than\nsolving the time-lock puzzle, whoever wants to query sensi-\ntive information needs to have physical access to the device,\nwithin a reasonable time-frame after which the information\nis not accessible.\nThe next layer of privacy involves moving from tempo-\nrary storage to permanent storage. Here there are two things\nthat should be noted, firstly, that the encryption of sensitive\ninformation with KPC ?KPL automatically makes essen-\ntial the cooperation of C and L in order to decrypt the infor-\nmation. Without the consent of C and L, no other entity can\naccess P ’s sensitive information. Given that this informa-\ntion is stored on a CSP which can be accessed by bothC and\nL, a probable collaboration between them could allow them\nto access P ’s location at specific moments. The continu-\nous tracking is not possible due to the previous encryption\nlayer. Nevertheless, the human factor in the relationship be-\ntween C and L may lead one of this entities to disclose its\nkey to the other, in order to facilitate patient’s tracking. The\nre-encryption of the result withKPL addresses to this expo-\nsure as well Even ifC and L decide to exchange their keys,\nto expose P ’s privacy this cannot be done immediately the\nsecond encryption with KPL ensures that the a predefined\namount of time must pass, before this is disclosed.\nThe use of biometrics for generation of the keysKPL and\nKPS however, provides a significant advantage. In case of\nsevere accidents where imminent measures must be taken,\nthe decryption key can be extracted, without patient’s assis-\ntance. When discussing about technological solutions for\npatients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, it is\nat least a contradiction to expect them to be able to remem-\nber passwords and recall them in case of emergency. The\nadoption of biometrics leverages this limitation, as the pa-\ntients do not need to remember anything.\n4 Conclusions\nThe number of patients with mild cognitive impairment\nhas the tendency to increase. The medical advances enable\nus to delay the mental decay, providing patients with a pro-\nlonged better quality of life and mental state. Nevertheless,\nas these processes cannot be stopped and in many situations\ncan lead to serious injuries or other discomfort situations,\nmodern devices are being used, most of them being privacy\nperversive.\nThis works proposes a new method that manages to\nprovide the full functionality without resorting to “Big\nBrother” models. The onion-like layers of the 


proposed\nmethod provide the necessary guarantees that only authen-\nticated entities may access the sensitive information. Addi-\ntionally, they deter any entity from trying to arbitrarily in-\nvade patient’s privacy, by applying strict time limitations on\nthe disclosure on information. The scheme can be compared\nor be considered an extension of m-Carer. However, there\nare significant changes in the that can be summarized in the\nfollowing: \(i ii information when in\nnormal usage, \(iii iv biometrics.\nUnder any circumstances, patients are people and they\nhave the fundamental right to preserve their privacy. Re-\ngardless of the discomfort that carers and relatives may\nfeel if they are not fully aware of the exact whereabouts\nof the patient, the proposed methodology enables us to de-\nvelop better and more respectful implementations of such\nservices.\nReferences\n[1] C.

the IO on behalf of the Erlang VM.\nIt is possible to assign special ‘asynchronous threads’ to\nthe Erlang VM These threads are used specifically for IO\noperations so that the Erlang scheduler threads do not block\nwaiting for IO to be handled.\nXII. FILE FORMAT\nCakeDB currently has a very basic file format. The ini-\ntial file format was very rudimentary consisting solely of a\ntimestamp, length and payload. This performed very well but\nshould the database fail or data be damaged, there would be\nno easy way to detect the failure. Therefore a more robust file\nstructure for the data file was devised \(see Section XII-A to the data file, CakeDB also generates an index file.\nThis file is still very basic consisting of a timestamp, a type\nand a byte offset. There is currently no redundancy or headers\nfor this file \(see Section XII-A for reading\nsequentially. Due to CakeDB’s natural order design, requests\nfor a block of data \(that is from timestamp A to timestamp\nB CakeDB Format - Data File\nSoM \(Start of Message Start of Payload End of Message three byte repeated sequences. They\nare used by CakeDB to determine whether the message read\nfrom disk follows the correct structure. This correctness is\ntested using Erlang’s binary pattern matching. If these se-\nquences are not in the expected locations, CakeDB will throw\nan error. It is anticipated that this mechanism can also be used\nto recover data files that become corrupted as CakeDB will\nbe able to determine the last valid message and remove the\ndamaged section.\nB. Index File Format\nThe current implementation of the Index File Format is\nsimplistic. It does not implement any error checking and is\neffectively an array of timestamps and byte offsets. This file is\niterated when executing a query to find the closest offset for a\ngiven timestamp. This is then used to open the data file at the\nright location. Although there has been no optimization done\non the index file \(it is opened and read sequentially for each\nquery in the current implementation extremely\nsmall compared to the data file size. A data file of 250GB could\nhave an index file only 100KB in size. Sequentially reading a\nbinary file has limited impact on performance.\nThe structure of the index file can be seen in Figure 7. The\nType field is currently unused by the query engine but allows\nthe process updating the index to specify what action caused\nthe index update. For example, were 1,000 messages written\nor was the 50MB limit reached?\nThe index file could be improved in a number of ways\nsuch as by adding redundancy and proper headers. Further\nperformance could probably be gained from moving this data\nto an in-memory data structure. However given the current\nperformance requirements, this has yet to be a concern.\nXIII. INITIAL THROUGHPUT EXPERIMENT\nA benchmarking script took a fixed JSON message and\nthen attempted to store that message using the most appropriate\nmethod for the given database. There were two messages used\n62\nfor this test. The first was approximately 3KB in size \(3,228\nbytes 1,158\nbytes For each test, a different number of messages was\ninserted, starting at 1,000 and doubling each time to reach\na total of 256,000 messages. Each test was run 5 times and an\naverage taken to give the final time Using this time and the\nnumber of messages inserted, the total throughput of messages\nper second was calculated.\nA. 1KB document size\nBased on the average value from each run, CakeDB\nachieved a maximum throughput of 64,981 \(Table I Table II making CakeDB capable of approximately 8.5 times\nthe throughput of MongoDB.\nTABLE I.

Although the message size was approximately\nthree times large, CakeDB lost 21.1% in throughput whereas\nMongoDB lost 42.7%.\nC. Pre-hashed JSON\nThe simulation remains as close to real world usage as\npossible by requiring both databases and their drivers to handle\nthe incoming JSON data. For CakeDB this does not pose a\nproblem because its standard stream type is raw, that is, it\nstore data in the same format that it is received. This means it\ndoes not need to 


process the JSON data into an intermediary\ndata format or do any processing on the message itself.\nMongoDB however must convert the data to BSON, a bi-\nnary based implementation of JSON. This first requires parsing\nthe JSON into Ruby’s native hash structure and from there\nconverting it to BSON data. JSON parsing would be required\nin any application performing this task and so as a real world\ntest, it is fair to include this load during MongoDB’s tests.\nThe YAJL C library is used in these tests which is currently\nconsidered to be one of the most efficient implementations\navailable. The Ruby MongoDB driver is also using the native\nC BSON driver, so the use of Ruby is not unfairly affecting\nthe results.\nHowever to determine whether the performance issues are\nin the JSON library, an additional test was done where the data\nwas converted to a hash only once. This hash was then passed\nto the MongoDB driver. This was repeated for both document\nsizes and get the results in table V and VI for both the 1KB\nand 3KB tests respectively.\nTABLE V. TIME TAKEN TO INSERT 1KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken \(seconds 4.79 19.12\nThroughput \(inserts per second TO INSERT 3KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken seconds inserts per second tests demonstrate that a significant amount of the\ntime is being spent parsing the JSON to a Ruby hash With\nthe 1KB documents, performance increased by approximately\n38.4% and by 52.6% for the 3KB documents. This suggests\nthat as the complexity and size of the document increases,\nthe time required to parse it also increases. However despite\nremoving the JSON parsing from the test, CakeDB remained\n5.4 times faster in the 1KB test and 5.5 times faster in the\n3KB test.\nD. Conclusions\nThe initial tests with both 1KB and 3KB documents\nshowed that CakeDB has better throughput for handling in-\nserts. This is due to its low impact client, streaming inserts\nand latched insert handling on the database itself. The results\ndemonstrate that a specialized database can out perform a\ngeneral purpose database and that CakeDB has significant\nperformance benefits over MongoDB. Additional tests showed\nthat even with pre-hashed datasets and using bulk inserts,\nMongoDB was not able to approach the performance offered\n63\nby CakeDB. This suggests that the performance difference is\nnot simply due to external overhead \(such as JSON parsing in industry there are numerous workloads that do\nnot lend themselves well to a ‘scale out’ approach. This paper\nproposed a disk based approach for storing and then retrieving\nsequential data. By using disk rather than RAM as the main\nform of storage, this approach is able to store significantly\nmore data on a given machine.\nXV. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nCurrently CakeDB only supports simple time range based\nqueries. This works well for reporting, but limits its applica-\nbility to more general use cases. To address this, support is\nbeing added for BSON \(Binary JSON allow for\nricher and more precise queries.\nAlthough CakeDB did not initially focus on read perfor-\nmance, in general usage, read performance was significantly\nbetter than expected. Further research will be undertaken to\ndetermine whether or not such an approach could yield similar\nread performance to current systems \(such as MongoDB Data\nraises questions as to how value can or should be defined.\nIt could be said that the value of data consists of both\nintrinsic and extrinsic value. Further research will be conducted\nto see whether pricing algorithms \(such as those used in\npricing financial derivatives value\nbenchmark.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Kallman, H. Kimura, J. Natkins, A.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
