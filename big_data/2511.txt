We\nalso share our experience and results on the big data analytics\nand discuss how the studies contribute to achieve Green Campus.\nIndex Terms—big data analytics; work?ow framework; event\nrecognition system; green building;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGreen Campus [1], [2 3] is an academic institution\nwhere energy resources \(e.g., electricity, gas, water, etc conserved by people \(faculties, staffs, students,\netc facilities\n\(of?ces, lecture rooms, dormitories, etc city development [4], [5]\nsince the academic institution or university tends to be one\nof the largest energy consumers in a city. Energy-ef?cient\nbuilding management is one of the essential challenges in the\ndevelopment of the Green Campus.\nSeveral achievements have been reported in both research\nand industry. The real-time power monitoring system [1],\n[2] wakes people to know what consumes more power and\nhow much power is consumed Especially, [1] announced that\nit successfully changes people’s behaviors and reduces 30%\nof the peak power consumption to the previous year. The\nenergy modeling/analysis tools [6] and the power automation\nsystem [7 provide the intelligent power control to optimize\nthe power usage without affecting people’s comfort.\nUnlike the achievements, we treat the energy-ef?ciency\nfrom the perspective of understanding events occurred in a\nbuilding. The events could be caused by the human-induced\nand/or environment, e.g., a student leaves a lab without turning\noff the light; an aircon is running over the weekend; a new\nserver cluster is installed; and typhoon hitting the city.\nThis paper studies an event recognition in a building based\non the patterns of power consumption by lighting, ventilation,\nelectronic equipment, etc. It is a big challenge to identify\nwhat kinds of events happened in a building without additional\ndevices such as camera and motion sensors, etc. Instead we\nlearn when and how the events happened from the historical\nrecord of power consumption and apply the lesson into the\ndesign of an event recognition system \(ERS to avoid wasting\npower in a building.\nThe ERS involves big data analytics such as correlation,\nclustering, and regression analysis with a large size of dataset\ncollected in a real time. Such a data intensive system is\nusually composed as a work?ow that is a sequence of data\nprocessing steps or tasks indicating how data is manipulated\n\(e.g., read, transform, visualize, etc optimization, and execution is\na signi?cant task of the system requiring data analysis. When\nhandling the real-time system, the work?ow management\nbecomes more critical in terms of the system scalability to\nmaintain high throughput or fast speed analysis.\nWith increasing order in data variety, volume, and velocity,\nprocessing those data consumes huge amount of computational\npower; therefore, there is a need to take into account cloud\ncomputing technologies. A limitation of existing work?ow\nmanagement systems \(e.g RapidMiner [8] and Taverna [9 such a work?ow scheduling policy, multiple tasks\nof multiple work?ows will not be ef?ciently executed Be-\nsides, users are required to determine how and where \(e.g.,\nlocal/remote machine, private/public cloud etc dif?cult decision for non-data\nmining experts although the importance of big data analytics\nhas been increasing in industry and business ?elds.\nWe have developed a work?ow framework that simpli?es\nthe complexity in work?ow management/execution for big\n2013 IEEE Ninth World Congress on Services\n978-0-7695-5024-4/13 $26.00 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/SERVICES.2013.29\n21\ndata analytics. The framework provides services for remote\nand 


parallel executions of the work?ows submitted by the\nwork?ow composers, who might be data scientists and ap-\nplication developers as well as non-data mining experts, from\nany devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobiles. To achieve\nparallel multiple work?ow executions, the submitted work-\n?ows are ef?ciently scheduled to meet work?ow execution\nrequirements \(e.g., deadlines parallel tasks \(e.g., written in MapReduce-\nequivalent programming not restricted to speci?c softwares particular, work?ow/task scheduling, resource provisioning,\nand data staging are addressed by the framework.\nWe run the ERS as a target system for the proposed\nframework with power consumption data collected from each\nof over 240 rooms in a building at Dept. of Engineering, Tokyo\nUniversity in 2011. We show that the proposed framework\naccelerates the speed of data analysis by providing scaling\ninfrastructure and parallel processing feature utilizing cloud\ncomputing technologies.\nThe contributions of the paper are as follows:\n• We have developed a data analytics work?ow framework\nthat provides services for remote and parallel work?ow\nexecutions and scaling infrastructure where cloud re-\nsources are dynamically provisioned for computing tasks\nand stored data according to the size of data analytics\n\(e.g., the size of users, work?ows tasks, and data management/execution and widens\nthe big data analytics opportunities for data analysts and\napplication developers as well as non-data mining experts.\n• We have investigated events occurred in a building from\nthe historical record of power consumption and applied\nthe ?ndings into the design of an event recognition\nsystem.\n• We share our experience and results on power consump-\ntion data in a building and discuss how the studies con-\ntribute to achieve energy savings towards Green Campus.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-\ntion II describes the proposed data analytics work?ow frame-\nwork in terms of its architecture, process ?ow, and resource\nprovisioning. Section III presents the case study of an event\nrecognition system supported by our framework and discusses\nabout the observations and analysis that we have obtained,\nfollowed by a conclusion.\nII. DATA ANALYTICS WORKFLOW FRAMEWORK\nA. Architecture\nFigure 1 shows the architecture of the proposed framework.\nThe framework consists of four layers such as work?ow\nclient work?ow management, compute service, and compute\nresource.\nWork?ow Client layer provides the end-user environment\nwhere users \(e.g., data analysts Taverna, and\nWorkflow Client\nWorkflow Management\nCompute Service\nCompute Resource\nTaverna RapidMinerJOpera\nMonitoring SecurityScheduling\nProvisioningData Staging\nJava RHadoop\nWeb Services.NET\nPython\nMPI\nGrid CloudLocal Cluster\nFig. 1. An architecture of the proposed framework.\nRapidMiner The tools provide a set of operators \(or compo-\nnents implements\nspeci?c functions, e.g., an operator to import and process data\nwith a certain data mining algorithm. The proposed framework\nprovides plug-ins to the tools for accessing functions available\nin the lower layer.\nWork?ow Management layer provides major functions to\nsupport the work?ow execution. For example Scheduling\nassigns work?ow tasks to certain remote applications \(e.g.,\nHadoop [10 Monitoring function observes\nthe status of work?ow tasks and keeps tracks of the computing\nresource usage Security function performs the encryption and\ndecryption of data and also manages the user authentication\nand authorization for computing services and resources in the\nlower layer. Data staging function ensures that data required\nby a work?ow are ef?ciently accessible to optimize work?ow\nexecution latency and data communication overhead. Provi-\nsioning function ensures that work?ow tasks are ef?ciently\ndistributed over provided computing resources.\nCompute Service layer provides a collection of services,\neach of which creates a program that performs a speci?c\nfunction, e.g., importing dataset, ?ltering data with criteria,\nclassifying data with a particular algorithm, and exporting\na result. The services can be implemented by various lan-\nguages/methods, e.g., Hadoop, Java, R, .NET Framework, and\nWeb Services. A set of the services can be composed as a\nwork?ow to do a data analytics job.\nCompute Resource layer provides computational platforms\nwhere the executable codes are hosted. Such a platform can\nbe provided from a local cluster \(e.g KVM e.g., Amazon EC2 [11 RapidMiner as a work-\n?ow client and Apache Oozie [12] as a work?ow scheduling\nsystem. This section explains the implementation including\na XML translator and a message queue architecture that are\nrequired between RapidMiner and Apache Oozie. Figure 2\nshows a process ?ow diagram that indicates how a work?ow\nwith messages and dataset is executed in the framework.\n22\nWorkflow\nComposer\nAuthenticator\n\(Authorizer nScheduler\nCluster\nProvisioner\nDataset\nRequest\nResource\nRequest\nInter-process\nCommunication\nData Broker\nPublic/Private \nCloud\nXML \nTranslator\nXML\nXML\n\b\t\n\f

A process ?ow diagram of the proposed framework.\nA user composes a work?ow with RapidMiner work?ow\neditor where a user can select a set of work?ow tasks\ncalled operators that are available for data analytics given by\nRapidMiner. The operators are connected as subwork?ows in a\nwork?ow. A user also can adjust parameters of the operators.\nFor example, an operator Read Dataset requires parameters\nfor a database connection and a SQL command to retrieve\nspeci?c data. When the user executes the composed work?ow,\nthe RapidMiner-based XML document is produced.\nAn XML Translator is implemented for converting a\nRapidMiner-based work?ow XML document into an Oozie-\nbased work?ow XML document since RapidMiner and Oozie\nuse different XML schemas for de?ning the same work?ow.\nThen, the translated XML document is submitted to the back-\nend work?ow execution engine. Inside the work?ow execution\nengine, once receiving submitted request which is represented\nas XML ?le, it then parses the request and invokes resource\nrequest service and dataset request service to provision com-\nputing resources and to upload dataset if necessary.\nWhen the cluster is ready, the work?ow planner assigns\nthe work?ow to Oozie scheduler as described in the XML\ndocument and the Oozie scheduler allocates the work?ow\ntasks to computing resources, i.e., Hadoop cluster. Oozie pro-\nvides functions for the work?ow scheduling and monitoring.\nIt is implemented on top of the Hadoop framework, and the\ndata locality function is provided by HDFS. It supports the\nexecution of work?ows consisting of multiple types of tasks,\ne.g., Java programs, shell scripts, and Hadoop jobs.\nThe cluster provisioner takes care of the virtual machine\n\(VM requests from the the work?ow planner.\nThe data broker is responsible for the data staging to support\nwork?ow executions determined by the scheduler. It discovers\nthe best data location/transfer that optimizes work?ow execu-\ntion latency and data communication overhead across public\nand/or private cloud resources provisioned by the provisioner.\nC. Resource Provisioning\nThis subsection addresses the on-the-?y resource provi-\nsioning features provided in our framework. As part of our\nsystem’s scalability and ?exibility features, we provide two\nInternet/LAN \nPClient PServer \n? \n? \n? \n? \n? ? \nPrivate Cloud \nCluster \nFig. 3. Provisioning procedures in private cloud.\nInternet/LAN \nec2PClient \n? \n? \n? \n? \nCluster \nFig. 4. Provisioning procedures in public cloud Amazon EC2 i.e., provisioning in private and public cloud,\nsuch as Amazon EC2 provision their computing\nresources, e.g., a Hadoop cluster.\n1 a more\nsecure and dedicated computing environment may have their\nown clusters. In such situation, our framework supports pro-\nvisioning resources from private cloud.\nIn our implementation \(see Figure 3 total 48\ncores and 96 GB memory IBM servers with KVM installed\nto build our private cloud. We developed both client, called\nProvisioner Client \(PClient PServer PClient integrated as part of an operator in RapidMiner\naccepts arguments from user, i.e., the total number of VMs\nand VM types, which is similar to Amazon EC2 Instance\nTypes [11]. VM types in our private cloud are de?ned ac-\ncording to different total number of cores, size of memory\nand software installations. We prepare system images, called\ntemplate, for different VM types accordingly. After receiving\nrequests from users, the PClient immediately forwards mes-\nsages \(Step 1 Internet/LAN to PServer, which is the\ncluster provisioner.\nIn the PServer side, we implemented a set of functions\nto communicate with KVM. When receiving requests from\nPClient \(Step 2 with the private\ncloud \(Step 3 PServer \(Step 4 Steps 5 and 6 returns the IP address, user name and login pass-\nword of the Hadoop cluster name node to PClient. Then in the\nupper layer, Work?ow Scheduler, i.e., Oozie, can communicate\nwith the provisioning Hadoop cluster. When users ?nish their\njobs, the provisioning cluster will be terminated by PClient\nand the private cloud releases these resource reservations.\n2 to build their own private cloud, thus, we\n23\nprovide the option to utilize public cloud service from current\nprevalent cloud markets in a pay-as-you-go paradigm, such\nas Amazon EC2. Similar to provisioning in private cloud, we\ndeveloped a client, called Amazon EC2 Provisioning Client\n\(ec2PClient resource provisioning fea-\ntures in Amazon EC2, but contrast to that, we do not need to\nimplement the provisioning server programs, since Amazon\nEC2 has done the provisioning server’s work and provides\nusers with APIs. Figure 4 shows the whole provisioning\nprocess in Amazon EC2.\nIn our system, we provide uni?ed interface for both PClient\nand ec2PClient. The ec2PClient acts as part of a RapidMiner\noperator as well. It accepts input parameters from front-\nend users. Similarly, these arguments include the number of\nprovisioning VMs and VM types, and then calls Amazon\nEC2 APIs \(Steps 1 and 2 on-demand instances of speci?ed\ntypes where Hadoop has been installed. Amazon EC2 re-\nsponses with Hadoop cluster name node IP address, user name\n\(Steps 3 and 4 


EC2 is about 3 minutes, and it will be slightly\naffected by network speed and the total number of instances\nto launch. This overhead is unavoidable, since Amazon EC2\nitself requires time to launch instances and to allocate IP\naddress, but it can be reduced by using other techniques [13],\n[14]. When jobs completed, users can export their results\ninto Amazon S3 [15] or directly download to local storage.\nThen these running instances will be terminated immediately\nor stopped alternatively for future use, in order to save time\nof launching instances. We observed that launching existing\nstopped instances is faster than launching new ones.\nDespite our current framework implementation is based on\nAmazon EC2, it can be easily extended to any cloud providers.\nOn the other aspect, compared with Amazon EMR [16], we\nlaunch a set of instances to build our own Hadoop cluster to\nsupport more customized functionalities, such as customized\nwork?ow scheduler, which is limited in Amazon EMR. In the\nfuture, we will optimize our resource provisioning features\nto be more monetary ef?cient, and automatically provision\nresources based on requirements \(e.g., completion deadlines submitted jobs [17], [18].\nIII. CASE STUDY\nThis section studies an event recognition in a building,\nsupported by our framework. We ?rst describe the preliminary\nanalysis on power consumption data and present how we\nconstruct the event recognition system. Then, we discuss the\nresults that we have obtained.\nA. Dataset\nIn this case study, we focus on four types of power con-\nsumed for lighting \(P1 P2 devices\n\(P3 P4 experimental equipment. The\nfour types of power consumption data are minutely collected\nat each of over 240 rooms in a building.

We have investigated the dataset from April to\nOctober in 20111, whose data size is about 10 GB.\nB. Analytics Work?ow\nTo perform preliminary analysis on the dataset, we design an\nanalytics work?ow using RapidMiner as illustrated in Figure 5.\nIt consists of three phases, feature extraction, clustering, and\ncorrelation as follows.\nThe feature extraction phase \(i e.g., a peak value replaces missing data with\nthe mean, \(ii e.g., sum, peak, avg, etc different periods \(e.g., a day, a week, a\nmonth e.g., hourly, daily, monthly and \(iii in\nterms of the total, peak, and daily average of the building.\nIn the monthly result, we have observe that the Plugs \(i.e.,\npower types P3 and P4 Plugs are almost constant\nduring the observation periods while that for Aircon increases\nin summer. Figure 6 shows the hourly power consumption of a\nbuilding from April 2 to 15, 2011. In this two-weeks snapshot,\na particular cycle in power consumption is clearly shown. We\nhave observed the daily peaks in the afternoon and the different\npeak values in weekdays and weekends.\nIn order to retrieve characteristics of the pattern, we com-\npute coef?cients for each power type of each room by applying\na regression model de?ned by\nyt = ?1 · t 2 · t2 + ?3 · t3 +  \(1 Figure 7 shows the hourly power\nconsumption collected at a room on April 2011 and the re-\ngression line. In this example, coef?cients are ?1 = ?0.0357,\n?2 = 0.0059, ?3 = ?0.0002, and  = 0.107.\nThe clustering phase divides rooms into groups by k-means\nalgorithm. As the input dataset, we produce a N ×M matrix\nwhere N is the number of rooms and M is the number of\nattributes. The attributes include room ID, statistics \(i.e sum,\npeak, avg i.e., ?1, ?2, ?3 i.e., a day, a week, a month and P4 types over 20 days due to sensor malfunctions.\n24\nFeature extraction CorrelationClustering\nRead Light\nRead Aircon\nRead Plugs\nReplace\nMissing value\nExtract Sum\nExtract Max\nLinear Regression\nWrite Statistics\nSelect Attributes\nAppend\nClustering\nWrite Groups Write Coefficients\nCorrelation Analysis\nRoom 1\nRoom 2\nRoom …\nPCA\nFig. 5.

We list the possible\nreasons as well.\nD. Event Recognition\nTaking account of the preliminary analysis, we estimate\na-day-ahead power consumption and identify the events oc-\ncurred at time the power consumption value exceeds a bound-\nary of the estimated value.\nSince we have observed a seven-days cycle in power con-\nsumption pattern, we ?rst take a differentiation on the hourly\ndataset as follows:\ny˜t = yt ? yt?w \(2 for the daily dataset for the hourly\ndataset trend.\nIn this paper, we consider ARMA \(Auto-Regressive Moving\nAverage y˜t?pw + ?t ?\nQ?\nq=1\n?q · ?t?qw \(3 for the daily dataset for the hourly\ndataset P and Q are the number of weeks that we look\nback the historical data. {?p}, {?q} are parameters, and {?t}\nare error terms.

We\ncapture the time when the observed value exceeds either the\nupper or the lower boundary.\nE. Performance Results\n1 composed by Rapid-\nMiner executed at remote on clouds, the execution time\nvaries depending on the data size and cluster size. We have\nmeasured the execution time for RapidMiner operators exe-\ncuted at remote on a single machine or clusters by the replace-\nment of Mahout algorithms [19] over different con?gurations.\nThere exists the decision point that tells which execution\nshould be chosen. Our framework supports the automatic\nselection of the execution options based on the measurement.\nFor example, Figure 10 shows the execution time that has\nbeen normalized according to the maximum value for the\nMahout k-means clustering algorithm on a Hadoop cluster over\ndifferent cluster sizes. We run the Mahout k-means example\njob with default arguments \(k = 6, delta = 0.5, iterations\n 10  from to KB to GB number of\ncompute node S1-S8 Amazon EC2.\nWhen the input data size is small \(e.g., Megabyte data local machine. The distributed\nalgorithm does not contribute to speed up the execution, since\nthe communication overhead and system warming up. On the\nother aspect, when the input data size is big \(e.g Gigabyte\ndata to 55% as the size\nof Hadoop cluster increased. We observe the similar results in\nAmazon EC2.\n2 Recognition: We evaluate the event recognition\nsystem \(ERS and applying the model on testing dataset. In this paper,\nwe determine the parameters in Equations \(3 4 using\nthe recent two-months dataset. Due to the page limitation, we\nintroduce only a few events detected by the ERS.\nFigure 11 shows the traces of the estimated power con-\nsumption of different power types and the detected outliers\n26\nTABLE II\nA LIST OF EXAMPLE EVENTS\nEvent types Data Scope Power Consumption \(PC Constraints Possible Reason\nE1: Registered Room The average PC of P3 increases Any day People brought new devices.\nRoom The total PC of P4 increases Any day New server cluster starts running.\nBuilding The total PC of P1 or P2 decreases Any day Maintenance for lighting or aircon system.\nE2: Waste Room P2 and P3 are OFF but P1 is ON Late weekend night People leaves a room without turning off lights.\nRoom P1 and P3 are OFF but P2 is ON Any hour Aircon is running in a empty room.\nBuilding The total PC exceeds the peak record.

One of the reasons we have found\nis typhoon arrived in Tokyo area at night on September 21.\nFigure 13 shows the track of the typhoon provided by JMA3.\nThus, many people may have not showed up the campus.\nAnother reason is that the following day \(September 23 holiday.\nBesides, the outliers are also detected on August 27 and\nSeptember 2. The power consumption for some power types\ndropped. However, it is just because of weekends; that is, these\ndetected outliers are false alarms. We will tune the model\nparameters and reduce such false alarms in the future work.\nFinally, we mention about the other event types E1 and E2\nthat the current ERS could not detect. For E1, we have not\nfaced with such situations or registered events during this six-\nmonths observation period. For E2, we can detect this type of\nevents by looking at the power consumption of each power\ntype in individual rooms.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has studied an event recognition in a building\nbased on the patterns of power consumption by lighting,\nventilation, electronic equipment, etc. We have learn when and\nhow the events happened from the historical record of power\nconsumption and applied the lesson into the design of an event\nrecognition system ERS remote and parallel executions of the work?ows,\nwhose tasks/jobs are ef?ciently scheduled and processed in\npublic/private clouds to meet work?ow execution requirements\n\(e.g., deadlines with the corre-\nsponding parallel tasks \(e.g., written in MapReduce-equivalent\nprogramming not restricted to speci?c softwares whose size is approx-\nimately 20GB or more Engineering, Tokyo University\nin 2011. The ERS have detected several outliers on power\nconsumption dataset caused by some events. The ?ndings of\nthe power consumption patterns at the detected events can be\nused for the optimal power control when the same events are\nlikely to occur in the future.\nWith the cloud resource scaling feature, our framework\nschedules and executes multiple work?ows/tasks in a parallel\nprocessing manner and it is immune to the size of data\nanalytics \(e.g., the size of users, work?ows, tasks and data University of Tokyo for providing the\npower consumption data.

another 1.5 million proficient data managers. \nForbes said, “Big Data will soon become the norm and no \none tags a name on what is the norm [38]”. Morgan Stanley’s \nreport insists that “Big Data is soon to become Any Data [39]”. \nIn order to win the future, the rational choice is that “giving \ncustomers the technologies they need to store and analyze ‘any’ \ndata set – any type of data, any size of data, for any type of user, \nand in any timeframe.”\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe development of big data extends the scope of human \nactivities. It demands proper attention from academia, industry \nand government. The world has been cooperating and \nintegrating on a global scale. Human is enforced to change \nmode from the local to the global in their everyday life and \nwork It redefines the relationship among individuals, \nbusinesses, organizations, governments, and societies through \nnetworked thinking and further to improve the human living \nenvironment, to enhance the quality of public services, to \nimprove performance, efficiency and productivity through the \nintelligentized interactive operating. The technological \nprogress and industrial upgrading of big data will create new \nmarkets, new business models and new industry rules, and \nmore importantly it demonstrates the collective will of a ncountry that looking for strategic advantage. Although there is \nstill a large gap to gain data intelligence like human wisdom \nbig data is a promising topic and it certainly helps us to \nunderstand the world from an entirely new aspect. \nREFERENCES\n[1] United Nations Global Pulse, 2012, Big Data for Development: \nChallenges Opportunities [R], May 2012 \n[2] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Fact Sheet: Big Data across the Federal Government \n[R], March 29?2012?www.WhiteHouse.gov/OSTP \n[3] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Obama Administration Unveils ?Big Data?

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
