B Sun L Dong Dynamic Model Adaptive to User Interest Drift Based on Cluster and Nearest Neighbors  Adjusted N X u  t is closer to the real situation It can prevent the over-\034tting problem caused by the analytical solution 013 is an adjustable parameter of 0-1 IV ALGORITHM CORE In this section we show the core part of our algorithm In 3.2 we just do a simple introduction In this section we will divide it into two parts to make complete explanation A TIME IMPACT FACTOR CALCULATION FORMULA In 3.2 we mentioned the time impact factor matrix but did not refer to the form of this matrix and the calculation formula First of all we give a detailed explanation of the Eq.\05010\051 R u  i 050 t 051 D T u  t 001 X u  t 05010\051 R u  i 050 t 051 indicates the rating that user u give the item i in time t  Note that the R u  i 050 t 051 is obtained according to the Eq.\0508\051 and is the time-related rating T u  t is the time impact factor matrix which indicates the preference of user u for each class at t time X u  t is the time factor coef\034cient matrix which provides us a linear combination coef\034cient This matrix is obtained by solving the analytic solution Here we explain generating method of T u  t  We assume that there are three models affecting the user rating for the item they are time interval number interval and seasonal impact For the three models we come up with three formulas to calculate the degree of impact Three time factors are calculated as follows respectively T 1 u  k  t D P i 2 k R u  i 050 a 001 e 000 025 j t 000 t 0 j C b 051  P i 2 k 050 a 001 e 000 025 j t 000 t 0 j C b 051 05016\051 In Eq.\05016\051 we calculate the impact of time interval for user u  T 1 u  k  t indicates the time interval impact factor of user u to class k in time t  t 0 indicates the time of rating item i  a  b and 025 are adjusting parameters these will be introduced in details in the section 4.2 When there are a lot of items belonging to the same class k  the longer the time interval between t and t 0 is the smaller the impact on the user's preferences will be the shorter the time interval of t and t 0 is the greater the impact on the user's preferences will be T 2 u  k  l D P i 2 k R u  i 050 a 001 e 000 025 j l 000 l 0 j C b 051  P i 2 k 050 a 001 e 000 025 j l 000 l 0 j C b 051 05017\051 In Eq.\05017\051 we calculate the impact of number interval for user u  T 2 u  k  l indicates the number interval impact factor of user u to class k  We sort items which the user u commented with the time sequence According to the location of the item in the user's time sequence algorithm arranges the corresponding position parameters l to each item In our framework T 1 u  k  t and T 2 u  k  l are complementary to each other then the algorithm can achieve a relatively stable prediction T 1 u  k  t is more in favor of a long-term stable time factor it is a function that change over time and is not affected by the user rate the other items so it has its own shortcomings After user u watched a movie of k category,user u watched 5 movies of the k C 1 category But T 1 u  k  t does not have a mechanism for the number interval the user interest maybe have changed but the model does not detect the change in time The T 2 u  k  l can solve this problem it is more in favor of a short time factor it also has its own problems it can't be monitored in time interval When T 1 u  k  t and T 2 u  k  l are combined the combination of temporary interest drift and long term interest drift is completed On this basis we try to 034nd the periodic trend of rating so we made another time impact factor function T 3 u  k  t  T 3 u  k  t D P i 2 k R u  i 001 cos 0502 031 001 t 000 t 0  86400 003 365 051  P i 2 k cos 0502 031 001 t 000 t 0  86400 003 365 051 05018\051 In Eq.\05018\051 we calculate the impact of seasonal factors for user u  T 3 u  k  t indicates the seasonal impact factor of user u to class k  We assume that u users rated some items that belong to k class in time t  then on the same day next year T 3 u  k  t will have higher value but after six months from the time t  the T 3 u  k  t will have the lower negative weight This formula guarantees that the function has the cyclical changes so that it can predict some item categories that has periodic characteristics We can de\034ne the time impact factor matrix T u  t under the impact of three factors T u  t D  T 1 u  1  t  T 2 u  1  l  T 3 u  1  t  T 1 u  2  t  T 2 u  2  l  T 3 u  2  t  001 001 001  T 1 u  k  t  T 2 u  k  l  T 3 u  k  t  Through the time impact factor matrix that we give we can see that each class have their own T 1 u  k  t  T 2 u  k  l  T 3 u  k  t  so each class will have their own X 1 u  k  t  X 2 u  k  l  X 3 u  k  t  The following is the expression of the time factor coef\034cient matrix X u  t  X u  t D  X 1 u  1  t  X 2 u  1  l  X 3 u  1  t  X 1 u  2  t  X 2 u  2  l  X 3 u  2  t  001 001 001  X 1 u  k  t  X 2 u  k  l  X 3 u  k  t  Note that T u  t  X u  t are for the user u  In other words each user has its own T u  t and X u  t vector B TIME DECAY FUNCTION FITTING In 4.1 Eq.\05016\051 and Eq.\05017\051 mentioned three parameters a  b  025  but we did not give their exact values because these three parameters are automatically adjusted based on the data sets and algorithm We propose a 034tting algorithm for the time decay function The main function is as follows f 050 t 051 D a 001 e 000 025 t C b 05019\051 1686 VOLUME 5 2017

B Sun L Dong Dynamic Model Adaptive to User Interest Drift Based on Cluster and Nearest Neighbors  more prominent With this research direction we found that this method is not the best personalized rating because the b u and b i aren't the best way to 034t We have come up with a weighted method of nearest neighbors rating r u  i 050 u  i 051  2 S D X v 2 U nei w uv r v  i 05024\051 U nei indicates the set of the user's nearest neighbors In our experiments we found that the Eq.\05024\051 is not very effective Through our research for the experimental data we think the problem is that we didn't use the 034lling method in the process of user clustering it lead to a bad result If user u has not rated item i  many nearest neighbors of user u has not rated item i  That leads to inaccurate rating so that the algorithm effect is not as good as the previous three algorithms Through this part of the research we have a certain understanding to 034ll method personalized prominent and stable 034ll method is easier to get a good clustering results B ITEM CLUSTERING METHOD In the item clustering we mainly solve 2 problems 1.Similarity algorithm of clustering 2 The clustering algorithm 1\051 SIMILARITY ALGORITHM OF CLUSTERING First we compare the similarity mainstream clustering algorithm respectively Euclidean distance cosine similarity Pearson correlation Euclidean formula as in Eq.\05025\051 E ij D v u u t  n X u D 1 050 r u  i 000 r u  j 051 2 05025\051 Cosine similarity formula as in Eq.\05026\051 sim 050 i  j 051 D P n 1 r u  i 001 r u  j  q  P n 1 r 2 u  i 001 q  P n 1 r 2 u  j 05026\051 Pearson correlation formula as in Eq.\05027\051 sim 050 i  j 051 D P n 1 050 r u  i 000 N r i 051 001 050 r u  j 000 N r j 051  q  P n 1 050 r u  i 000 N r i 051 2 001 q  P n 1 050 r u  j 000 N r j 051 2 05027\051 Comparing these algorithms in the experiments we found that Pearson correlation algorithm is better than the cosine algorithm and Euclidean distance After our analysis we think that the cosine algorithm does not take into account the relationship between the rating and the average rating it only considers the angle problem instead of the real neighborhood For example i 1  i 2  i 3 three items respectively get the same three users ratings ratings vector is i 1 0504,4,4\051 i 2 0501,1,1\051 i 3 0504,4,5\051 It is obvious that i 2 and i 3 are more similar but the cosine algorithm calculate that i 1 and i 2 are more similar Because this method doesn't take into account the relationship between the rating and the average rating which can show user attitude for the movie Euclidean distance appears similar problem Without considering the user attitude the clustering is not accurate Instead we can 034nd that Pearson coef\034cient take into account the problem of average rating Following this direction we 034nd another algorithm Adjusted Cosine Similarity Like Pearson correlation The range of Adjusted Cosine Similarity is 1 to 1 The difference between the adjusted Cosine Similarity and the Pearson correlation is the selection of the average rating We have mentioned above in fact the users attitude will be a great in\035uence on clustering Finally the experimental result of the adjusted Cosine Similarity is better than Pearson correlation Adjusted Cosine Similarity is given by Eq.\05028\051 sim 050 i  j 051 D P n 1 050 r u  i 000 N r u 051 001 050 r u  j 000 N r u 051  q  P n 1 050 r u  i 000 N r u 051 2 001 q  P n 1 050 r u  j 000 N r u 051 2 05028\051 2\051 THE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM In 3.1 we have mentioned that this algorithm is the combination of K-means algorithm and agglomerative hierarchical Algorithm But in the popular aggregation algorithm the algorithm will combine the two closest class At the beginning we used this aggregate algorithm In the process of the experiment we found that this aggregation algorithm is not very suitable for our algorithm because what we need is relatively big data amounts in each class that can be used to observe user interest drift If we use the popular aggregation algorithm we can 034nd that there are isolated point or small groups monopolizing a class which is not conducive to the observation of interest drift On this basis we use the mode of merging minimal class and its nearest class to replace another mode of merging the nearest class The advantage of this method is that the element numbers in each class are relatively average it facilitate the observation of interest drift C CALCULATION OF TIME IMPACT FACTOR In 4.1 we put forward three calculation formulas about time factor and give the time impact factor matrix We think that the three time impact models are effective But in the experiment we found that is not the case In the MovieLens data set the effect of using T 1 u  k  t  T 2 u  k  l is better than using T 1 u  k  t  T 2 u  k  l  T 3 u  k  t  Based on the results of this test the reasons are analyzed We believe that the main reasons for the T 3 u  k  t failure are as follows 1 The long time periodic characteristics of movie data set may be not exist  the majority of users will not change their own interests over season or month Therefore periodic change does not help predict very well 2 The periodic change model T 3 u  k  t is too simple or it is not suitable for the interest drift prediction after clustering D TIME DECAY FUNCTION FITTING In 4.2 we discuss a new method for obtaining time decay function In the hypothesis we think this is a good algorithm it can regulate time decay function based on different databases in order to better 034t the data set But the effect of the algorithm isn't good in the experiment We found that the time decay function can't achieve better results compared with taking a D 1  b D 0

B Sun L Dong Dynamic Model Adaptive to User Interest Drift Based on Cluster and Nearest Neighbors  analysis of the experimental results we found that the following problems may affect the 034nal experimental result 0501\051 User selection MovieLens data sets are cleaned data sets users who rate less than 20 movies completely deleted in this data set In this case the statistics of TOP 000 N have a certain error this error can interfere the 034nal 034tting result 0502\051 Item selection MovieLens data sets not only clean users but also screen movies with certain rules this type of screening is arti\034cial We found that many movies already exist before the initial starting time of the data set The data set has a certain degree of closure There is a problem after the movie exists a year or a few years the number of evaluation will become stable it will affect the results and cause error 034tting 0503\051 Data set we choose relatively stable movie data sets rather than news data set that has more real-time effect In this stable data set the algorithm is very sensitive to the weight 015 of TOP 000 N  especially like MovieLens 100k that is small closed and stable data set The adjustable parameter of 015 became a problem remaining to be solved 0504\051 Algorithm in addition to the Eq.\05020\051 and Eq.\05021\051 we don't have a better method to calculate the similarity This similarity calculation uses average In the large data set the average similarity will lose its due effect because the similarity degree will be more closer to 015 after many days 0505\051 Model we have used the Eq.\0508\051 to remove the nontime impact factor In the process of eliminating We may have removed the part that is affected by the parameter b in Eq.\05019\051 which led to the parameters b can't play its effect VI PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON In this section we will do the work of Adjustment parameter and we will compare our algorithm with some mainstream algorithms A EVALUATION METRICS AND DESCRIPTION OF TEST SET To estimate the quality of each algorithm and compare these algorithms we have used internationally accepted measurement methods RMSE 050Mean Squared Error Root\051 and MAE 050Mean Absolute Error\051 RMSE D v u u t  P 050 u  i 051 2 S 050 r u  i 000 O r u  i 051 2  j S j 05029\051 MAE D P 050 u  i 051 2 S j r u  i 000 O r u  i j  j S j 05030\051 Compared with MAE method RMSE method increases the punishment of the large error r u  i indicates the actual rating of the item O r u  i indicates the predictive value of the item B DATASET PREPARING Our experiments are based on three well-known movie rating data sets MovieLens 100k MovieLens 1M and MovieLens 10M The three data sets were collected by the Uni v ersity TABLE 1 Characteristics of the datasets FIGURE 3 When clustering number k c is 5 Neighbor number and RMSE of Minnesota as a research project The advantage of using these data sets is that these data sets have been cleaned in advance which can ensure the low noise of the data set It helps to better observe the effectiveness of the algorithm We describe the related data of these data sets in table 1 In test set we use 034ve latest data of each users as the test set elements So MovieLens 100k test set has 4715 elements MovieLens 1M test set has 30200 elements MovieLens 100k test set has 357835 elements These data sets have considerable test sets which can detect the effectiveness of the algorithm C ADJUSTMENT OF PARAMETER In the section V we made the experiment method comparisons and also give the reasons for the effect improvement In the parameter adjustment stage we can only adjust parameters based on experimental results we 034rst made adjustments in a large range then we adjust further on these effective intervals There are two important parameters to be adjusted User neighbor number k n of k nearest neighbor algorithm and the clustering number k c of items clustering algorithm 1\051 ADJUSTMENT WORK OF k n In the choice of neighbor number k n  we 034rst tested from 0 to 50 with interval of 5 When the neighbor number k n is 0 we found the RMSE is 1.034084199 that is not a good prediction effect This result also indirectly proves that we can use the nearest neighbor model to prevent over-\034tting We found a small value when k n D 15 We have done experiments for 10-20 The results are shown in Figure 3 Finally we get the RMSE minimum 0.960140846 when k n D 17 2\051 ADJUSTMENT WORK OF k c In the choice of neighbor number k c  we 034rst tested from 1 to 15 with interval of 1 We found that the algorithm will reach a relatively stable value in clustering number k c is 3-7 The results are shown in Figure 4 After several tests we found that RMSE will reach the minimum value 0.921690948 when the k c D 4 VOLUME 5 2017 1689

dynamic algorithms are dependent on the time variation If the personal data set is very small the dynamic algorithm may not show better results than the static algorithm VII CONCLUSIONS In this paper we propose a new dynamic recommendation algorithm DTDM This algorithm classi\034es all items and predicts unknown ratings on each class in order to better rating prediction results we use the pseudo inverse matrix method to optimize DTDM algorithm and use the nearest neighbor method to prevent over-\034tting In the experiment we did some comparison of algorithm details At last we adjust the parameters and compare with some mainstream algorithms on three big data sets The experimental results show that the DTDM algorithm has excellent performance In the next step we need to 034nd more effective cycle impact factors and decay function 034tting algorithms in order to enhance the performance of the algorithm again ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to sincerely thank the
