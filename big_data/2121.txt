these fundamental security building blocks.  In this paper we present classroom and lab exercises that use NSAês Security Enhanced Linux \(SELinux\o teach information assurance lessons.  SELinux is included in Red Hatês Fedora Linux distribution and in a variety of other Linux distributions.  Although SELinux is growing in popularity, there is limited curriculum available to help orient students to its use.    This paper describes lecture topics, in-class exercises and lab concepts that can be used to introduce students to SELinux and, through SELinux to the fundamental concepts of least privilege and mandatory access control policies   1. Introduction  
The field of information assurance is in a state of rapid development and change.  New attacks and new defensive measures are described and deployed daily Students want to use the latest tools and see realworld situations.  As educators, we want to give students the fundamental principles and understanding that will help them far into the future not just expose them to the popular applications of today.  In this paper we describe how we use a new security technology to teach classic security principles Security Enhanced Linux was developed by the 
National Security Agency as an implementation of fine-grained mandatory access control with a separation of policy and mechanism that allows a wide variety of security policies to be enforced Implemented as a Linux Security Module, SELinux adds a reference monitor to the Linux kernel so that fine-grained access control decisions can be enforced With mandatory access control, any permission not explicitly granted is denied, and permissions apply to a much wider range of operating system resources than just files.  SELinux has been embraced by Red 
Hat Linux community as a defense against zero day attacks.  While it does not prevent an exploit s compromise of an application it contains the damage that can be done.   Applications that are confined in an SELinux sandbox can be restricted to a small set of required behaviors.  Even an exploited application can only exhibit the behaviors it has been previously allowed.  As SELinux is more widely deployed, more reports of its success in preventing root compromises have emerged [2  1 3    1 4  Security Enhanced Linux is readily available 
SELinux is a default-enabled security feature of Red Hat distributions Fedora 3 and later and Enterprise Linux 4 and later.  SELinux is an optional feature in Gentoo \(Hardened\ \(4.0 etch release\d Ubuntu \(8.04 Hardy Heron release\ addition the Flask architecture, the basis for SELinux, is being incorporated into Solaris[4  h is eas y av ai labilit y  makes SELinux a good choice for lab exercises Because SELinux is seen as new and exciting students appreciate the chance to try it out 
SELinux has a reputation for being difficult to use   s e cu rit y tec h n o l o g i es often  f a ce a u s er  acceptance barrier because they are perceived by users as reducing the functionality of the system in the service of the amorphous \(to users\ goal of security.  Also, as we will explain, SELinux is a policy enforcement system.  If the policy being enforced does not match the user s typical actions then the user must either modify the policy or disable the enforcement.  In early releases of the system modifying security policy seemed very complex so 
users would disable SELinux if they ran into any problems.  However, the usability of the system has been greatly improved on two fronts.  First, a growing number of policy developers have been creating policy that accurately constrains critical and network facing processes while leaving unconstrained user processes that are not security critical.  Most users and administrators will find that Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3 2009 U.S. Government Work Not Protected by U.S. Copyright 
 


this policy matches their typical actions and will thus have improved security with very little difference in their day to day operations using this policy.  Second there has been a major technology leap in the SELinux policy infrastructure and in the tools that assist in writing policy.  Loadable modules semanage, system-config-selinux, setroubleshoot and SL n able users t o iden ti fy a n d resol v e  many policy problems on their own.  As a result, the majority of Fedora users now leave SELinux enabled   An increasing amount of reference material is available on SELinux, but not much of it is suitable for the brief amount of time available in an introductory class.  Existing tutorials focus on demonstrating how to install SELinux and how to write security policy for SELinux.  These tasks are not necessarily suitable for the short amount of time available to introductory students.  Our approach instead uses a pre-existing SELinux installation and policy as an experimental platform that students can use to test ideas about mandatory and discretionary access control  We also provide a basic introduction to policy writing, but one that uses only the simplest policy statements In the next section of this paper we provide a general overview of SELinux, concentrating on its relation to fundamental information assurance concepts.  In section three we provide an in-class exercise that can be used to familiarize students with SELinux concepts.  Section four gives laboratory exercises that teach SELinux basics.  Section five covers related work and section six gives our conclusions  2. SELinux Overview  We use SELinux to teach the fundamental security concepts of least privilege, mandatory access control and the importance of the separation of policy and mechanism.  These concepts will be useful to students in understanding a variety of information assurance situations.  These principles also provide useful lecture topics for an overview of SELinux SELinux can also be used to implement role-based access control and multi-level security, but in an introductory class we feel that it is important to focus on a few concepts in greater depth Least privilege refers to the idea that a user or program should have only the minimum permissions required to complete its mission.  Therefore, the operating system must enforce confinement once these minimal permissions have been defined.  Most students are familiar with the PC environment where programs are automatically given the privileges of their user.  For example, a solitaire game run by user Alice can access all of Alice s files, communicate with and kill other of Alice s processes and open sockets to the network.  Clearly, for higher security operation Alice would like the solitaire game only to have access to those resources it absolutely requires e.g. writing to the screen and the high score file.  In this way, if the game was written with malicious intent or if the game is compromised by an attacker the attacker will not reap much benefit from the compromise. In Windows or UNIX it is possible to further confine a program, by running a firewall changing the account the program runs as or by changing filesystem permissions.  However, in general the default is to allow a program to act as the user this can be thought of as default allow  SELinux is a default deny system where the goal is to assign the minimum privileges to each program In SELinux a reference monitor checks the security policy each time a controlled action is attempted.  SELinux policy is extremely fine-grained controlling signals, shared memory access, filesystem access, disk access, network access, etc.  To achieve these checks, SELinux integrates the Flask Security Architecture into the Linux operating system. Flask is a flexible mandatory access control architecture that is a generalization of Type Enforcement s  h a v e been added to t h e kernel so that the security reference monitor is called whenever one of these protected actions occurs These hooks have been incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel and are usable by other security add-ons as the Linux Security Module Framework \(LSM\ verifying every one of these protected actions, security policy quickly becomes very large The traditional UNIX access control model is a form of Discretionary Access Control \(DAC\his model includes an all-powerful root or superuser account and allows data owners to set access control for their data.  It has the advantage of simplicity and is generally easily understood by users.  However, it is totally unsuited to implementing least privilege Mandatory access control \(MAC\kes access control decisions away from the data owner and requires that subjects \(processes\ and objects \(files sockets, etc\ave labels.  The security manager \(a human administrator\policy indicating what labels can be accessed and what labels are produced on new objects.  Users cannot override this policy Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


Traditionally, MAC is linked to Multi-Level Security MLS\where, for example, a top secret process would not be allowed to share its data with an unclassified process.  However, MAC can be used in many other ways.  With security labels and a reference monitor, the security manager could choose to implement a permissive policy or could implement a least privilege policy.  Discretionary Access Control is based largely on user privileges, with processes automatically inheriting the privileges of their user.  Mandatory Access Control breaks this inheritance tie and allows each process to have its own security policy It is also very important for students to understand the importance of the separation of policy and mechanism.  If SELinux had been implemented to enforce only military security policies like MultiLevel Security \(MLS\, then it would have been much less useful to the wider Linux community.  Since it allows any policy to be enforced, this has allowed a variety of policies to be developed and made available to users.  This flexibility is arguably why SELinux has gained the support of the open source community, with thousands of hours of development time donated to the project  3. In-class exercise  SELinux \(and mandatory access control in general\s on a detailed set of security policy statements to create a least privilege policy.  Keeping in mind that students can successfully use SELinux without writing policy themselves, it is still useful to give them a taste of policy creation.  Diving directly into policy writing can make least privilege policy a daunting task, but relating SELinux concepts to things students are familiar with makes the task easier.  For this exercise students are asked to create a pen and paper security policy for the rules of baseball.  The key SELinux policy concepts are object classes, permissions and security contexts Security contexts are the primary access control attribute for SELinux. The security context consists of a user, role, and type. This exercise focuses on understanding types. This exercise allows students to identify objects and permissions, define types, and write a sample policy For the purpose of this exercise, an object class is any resource in the system.  In the operating system students may be familiar with the concepts of file objects and the associated permissions of read, write and execute.  For the exercise, students are asked to brainstorm to construct a list of objects used in baseball - ball, glove, bases, field, etc.  Even people can be considered objects in this analogy.  Students should be encouraged to keep the objects as general as possible, details such as types of players will be defined using types In the operating system, permissions are actions that can be taken on the objects.  For example, a socket or a file may be read or written. Students are asked to brainstorm the actions that can take place in baseball - running, hitting, catching, etc The next phase of the exercise helps students understand how general objects can be bound to a particular role or type using a security context.  For example, computer users may have the role of administrator.  Types/roles help policy writers by grouping similar objects together.  Students are asked to brainstorm to construct a list of positions - first baseman, hitter, pitcher, on-deck hitter, umpire, and a list of object types - catcher s mitt, fielder s mitt, etc Writing rules or policy according to player s names Jeter, Ichiro\ould be much more time consuming than writing policy according to more general object types Finally, students are asked to write some sample policy in the baseball domain.  Students will use the objects, permissions and types defined above to write a mandatory access control policy for baseball.  The students should be asked to come up with as many rules as possible that would allow the game of baseball to be played.  They should work under the assumption that anything not explicitly allowed is denied.  If the policy does not say the hitter can pick up the bat and swing it, then those actions are automatically denied.  The rules should take the following form  allow [source type  t ar get t y pe   O bj ect cl as s   Permissions    An example rule set for the completion of a pitch might look like the following  allow pitcher game_ball:ball{ throw catch allow catcher game_ball:ball {throw catch tag_runner  Students will generate a large number of rules but it will be impossible to generate a complete set of allow rules for the game of baseball.  This will give students an understanding of how lengthy a MAC policy can be and why SELinux s policy can be so large.  It should be emphasized that the security Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


policy is not a program.  It does not define, for example, how a player would swing, decide which ball to hit, etc In the final phase of this exercise students should be shown example SELinux policies so they can see how the baseball policies they just wrote mirror the policy files that have been written for the Linux operating system and the applications that run on top of it.  Objects that are familiar to the students such as files and sockets can be used to explain how SELinux s policy is written.  For example, the following policy snippet allows apache to connect to port 80 and send and receive messages  allow httpd_t httpd_port_t:tcp_socket {recv_msg send_msg name_bind  As a result of this exercise students should comprehend objects, permissions and types and should be able to apply these policy creation building blocks  4. Lab exercises  We have created several lab exercises to give students hands-on exposure to how MAC and DAC differ and how policy is written for a least privilege system.  These exercises also orient students to the use of an SELinux system and give them a better understanding of the benefits available to SELinux users The following exercises could be used in a lab or homework assignment.  We used VMware images to provide flexibility for our lab setup and to easily restore to the starting image after the lab concludes Our lab setup was tested using Fedora 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 but any recent Fedora distribution should also work  4.1. Policy Enforcement  This lab exercise gives students hands on experience with how SELinux enforcement can prevent a security breach by preventing applications from misbehaving. This exercise is loosely based on the Lupper worm that targeted Linux systems through a PHP application flaw e rv ers run ning t h e  flawed application the attacker could send PHP code which would be executed at the server.  Attackers sent code similar to the following  exec\("cd /tmp; wget http://example.com/exe chmod u+x exe; ./exe  Systems running SELinux with the default policy shipped by RedHat were protected from this worm because the SELinux policy prevented the exe binary from executing from the /tmp directory  To begin the exercise the students will write a simple c program containing their attack This could be an infinite loop or could be more complex like opening a port to receive messages from a botnet controller.  Then they will save their attack  program to /tmp and set the permissions on the script to allow execution.  It should be explained that the students are simulating an attack by executing their attack script through the web server's cgi-bin.  The following Perl script should be placed in the cgi-bin of the web server setup  script.pl  usr/bin/perl exec '/tmp/attack print "Content-type: text/html\\n\\n print "Hello  This script will run the attack and display Hello to the browser. This eliminates the  PHP portion of the attack, but maintains the core of the lesson because any time an application is exploited the attacker basically has the permissions of a user on the system  Next students should put SELinux into permissive mode by using the command  setenforce 0  At this point,  students should direct their browsers to http://localhost/cgi-bin/script.pl. The students can use the ps command to check to see that their attack is running. The students should now kill the running process and put SELinux into enforcing mode using the command  setenforce 1  Now when the students  direct their browser to http://localhost/cgi-bin/script.pl, they will get a denial message. This denial message can be viewed in var/log/audit/audit.log. The message will look like the following  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


audit\(1219974398.668:4\ avc:  denied  { execute for  pid=5945 comm="script.pl" name="attack dev=dm-0 ino=6324245 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_sys_script_t:s 0 tcontext=user_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=file  This is an example of the kind of protection that SELinux offers. It prevents applications from performing operations that are not allowed according to the security policy.  In this case the security policy prohibits executions from /tmp.  This directory is often used as a scratch space by various applications so allowing read and write access but not execution access makes sense.  While there are other ways to prohibit execution from /tmp without using SELinux these methods must be added piecemeal.  Because SELinux uses Mandatory Access Control the default deny philosophy means that permissions that are not required are already denied As a result of this lab exercise students will understand the basics of how SELinux is enabled and disabled and where the audit messages can be found    4.2. Policy Writing  This lab exercise introduces students to policy writing.  Specifically, they will add policy statements to allow two simple processes to communicate via Unix domain sockets.  The result of the lab will be a policy that confines each process to a least privilege sandbox.  Although they will be writing and running actual SELinux policy, the processes are designed so that they can be supported by only a few lines of SELinux policy.  This policy will be added to a preexisting set of policy rules and the new policy can be compiled and run by the students To set up the lab, the instructor or teaching assistant can prepare the workstations by creating a new reference policy module for the students to modify.  The SELinux Reference Policy documentation has a tutorial that outlines the steps necessary n a  m o re ad van ced clas s t h e s t u d en t s  can follow these steps themselves, but it may be overwhelming for a beginning IA class To begin the lab, students will download or will be given the code for two simple processes that open sockets to each other.  Standard reference code from Stevens n be us ed.  Af ter co m p ili n g a n d  running the code, students will use the strace tool to view a listing of all the system calls and signals of the executables.  The command line syntax for strace is  strace -o server.txt ./server strace -o client.txt ./client  This will produce two text files. Below is a snippet of the server.txt file  socket\(PF_FILE, SOCK_STREAM, 0\ = 3 unlink\("socket"\  = 0 bind\(3, {sa_family=AF_FILE, path="socket"}, 10\ = 0 listen\(3, 5\  = 0  This snippet shows the creation of a socket, the unlinking of the file socket so that the bind system call does not fail, the process binding to the socket and listening on the created socket with a maximum of five pending connects Another way to discover the system calls of a process is to run it under SELinux and view the audit log to see the list of denied actions.  Below are two examples of denial statements that are generated when you run the server application. For simplicity the runcon command can be used to run the client and server in the proper context. These messages are located in /var/log/audit/audit.log  type=AVC msg=audit\(1213364633.704:1355\: avc denied  { create } for  pid=4721 comm="server name="socket scontext=user_u:system_r:myserver_t:s0 tcontext=user_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=sock_file  type=AVC msg=audit\(1213364633.699:1354\: avc denied  { unlink } for  pid=4721 comm="server name="socket" dev=dm-0 ino=3244274 scontext=user_u:system_r:myserver_t:s0 tcontext=user_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=sock_file  Because these audit messages can be difficult to understand a tool called setroubleshoot was created by Red Hat to help decipher these cryptic audit messages.  This tool gives a more lengthy and hopefully clearer description of the denial recorded in the audit log.  An example of setroubleshoot output is shown in Figure 1.  Setroubleshoot will allow the students to understand the denial messages that are generated by SELinux and sugguest possible ways to fix them. It may sugguest running a particular command or setting a boolean within the policy. But Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


when writing a policy for an application straces and audit2allow may be more helpful. Audit2allow is a command that is available on SELinux systems to generate allow rules from denial messages Audit2allow will be the simplest for students to generate the appropriate allow rules Students can use strace, setroubleshoot audit2allow and their knowledge of how a server works in order to produce a least privilege policy to confine the client and server process. The allow rule that is necessary to eliminate the two denials displayed above is  allow myserver_t user_home_t:sock_file {create unlink   Once students have determined the allow rules needed to permit the client and server to run they should follow the directions listed below to create and install the policy  1  Insert the allow rules into the provided template \(shown in Figure 2 2  Run the make command using the Makefile provided in the /usr/share/selinux/devel directory 3  Use the command semodule -i [policy module  p p to install the policy module 4  Run the server and client program to see that the policy is accurate  As a result of this lab exercise students should be able to perform simple policy modifications.  This exercise only requires students to use allow statement.  SELinux policy has more powerful syntax available that can be explored by more advanced students using the tutorials and resources described in the next section  5. Related Work  There are several other tutorials available for teaching aspects of SELinux.  These tutorials have Figure 1:  Example setroubleshoot output Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


different goals than our exercises, being primarily aimed at teaching students how to convert a system to SELinux operation or teaching students how to begin writing security policy.  However, these would be useful in constructing follow up exercises for an advanced class IBM developerWorks features a tutorial on how to convert a Gentoo distribution so that it runs with SELinux turned on h e t u torial e m p h as izes t h at  converting a kernel to use SELinux is not generally necessary but is an interesting exercise for someone who wants to see how SELinux works in more detail The tutorial also covers how to write a simple policy extension Russell Coker a contributor to the SELinux project, has a variety of useful information available on his website.  In his SELinux Administration Tutorial [9 he c o ve r s ho w t o i n st a l l SE Li nu x a n d  perform basic configuration including creating user accounts and running daemons in the correct security context.  He also runs an SELinux play machine  which is available for anyone to log in to as root[10    Of course, the root account on SELinux can be constrained to have very few privileges, as is the case here SELinux is also covered briefly in Tikekar and Bacon s description of undergraduate lab exercises in computer security h e y s ugg es t a f i n a l cou r s e  project where students compare application performance on a machine running SELinux versus a machine where SELinux is disabled For more extensive information on SELinux, there are several reference books ava  d several useful blogs with up to date information    T h e Fedora P r o j ect als o h a s a n i n f o r m ati v e  SELinux FAQ d N S A h a s a s e t of S E L i n ux web pages  6. Conclusions  We feel that SELinux is an important topic to cover in introductory information assurance classes both in its own right as a valuable technology and as a concrete example of least privilege and mandatory access control.  Most of the existing educational material available for SELinux is focused on training future security policy writers.  In this paper we have provided material that is focused on educational rather than training goals.  We have provided lecture topics, in-class exercises and lab exercises useful for teaching least privilege, mandatory access control and SELinux policy basics We have used these lessons in undergraduate information assurance classes and received positive feedback from the students.  Although SELinux is based on operating systems security techniques that have been under investigation for decades, the incorporation of these powerful techniques into open source operating systems has generated a great deal of excitement.  Students appreciate the chance to work with real-world tools like SELinux that can counter the threat of zero day attacks  7.

CONCLUSIONS A fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process approach model for selecting a strategic big-sized R&amp;D program in the sector of energy technology development was established in this paper as an extended model of the AHP approach. We demonstrated herein the results compiled when the fuzzy integrated multi-criteria decision making method approach was employed. We created a one-tier hierarchy structure and established the list of criteria and sub-criteria using 6 criteria namely energy environment \(EE ES technical spin-off \(TS M KM C weights of sub-criteria using fuzzy integrated AHP approach using triangular fuzzy numbers. In terms of criteria list, which was based the fuzzy AHP approach, technical spin-off ranks first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off 


first, followed by KIER mission, economical spin-off marketability, energy environment, and cost. Although the quantitative data presented in this paper, which garnered by the peer reviews of experts, is limited, we have efficiently demonstrated the selection of a big-sized R&amp;D programs in the sector of energy technology development based on the fuzzy integrated analytic hierarchy process with triangular fuzzy numbers Finally, this research provides energy policy makers with the fundamental data needed to establish the framework of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs for producing well focused R&amp;D outcomes instead of simple outputs. As a further study of this research, we are planning to apply the fuzzy integrated analytic network process approach [12] and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process/data envelopment analysis hybrid model for measuring the relative efficiency of a strategic big-sized R&amp;D programs from an econometric viewpoint [13-16  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to express our gratitude to the expert who participated in the peer-review process  NOMENCLATURE AHP:   Analytic hierarchy process C:    Cost CI:    Consistency index CR:    Consistency ratio DEA:   Data envelopment analysis EE:    Energy environment    ES:    Economical spin-off KIER:   Korea institute of energy research KM:    KIER mission M :    Marketability HE:    Hydrogen economy HERC:   Hydrogen energy R&amp;D center HOP:   High oil prices MCDM:  Multi-criteria decision making method TS:    Technical spin-off UNFCCC: United nations framework convention of climate change  REFERENCES 1] S.K.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
