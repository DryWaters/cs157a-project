Weber Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59717  Abstract We have developed an automatic calibration system for arbitrary shaped array. A signal generator drove a horn antenna to provide a signal source and a spectrum analyzer was connected to the output of an 8 - channel beamformer to collect data. The entire interface was automated using LabVIEW, which included a program to upload the weights to the beamformer, control system for the signal generator spectrum analyzer and a rotator. Our calibration method involved connecting each of the eight channels on the beamformer to an eight to one relay that would select one channel to pass through to the output of the relay. Then we connected one port of a vector network analyzer \(VNA\the output of the 1 to 8 relay and the other port of the VNA to the output of the beamformer  The algorithm for calibration would have the VNA apply a weight to one of the channels at a time, and the VNA would read the output. A LabVIEW program would switch through all eight channels storing the applied weights and the outputted weights. Then it would compare all eight weights and find the channel with the largest error and correct that channel. The program would loop until the total error was within a user set threshold. After calibration we ran beamforming and nullsteering tests in the anechoic chamber at various angles to test the accuracy of the beam or null point angle, the side lobe level and the depth of null. The test results show that the calibrated array has a much improved beam pattern comparing with the one without calibration and it is very close to the simulated pattern.  We improved the general accepted approaches by introducing an automatic system with a properly defined calibration procedure, thus freeing people from tedious, time consuming calibration process  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  D ATA M ODEL 1  3  S YSTEM O VERVIEW 2  4  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS   4  5  S UMMARY 6  R EFERENCES 6  B IOGRAPHY 6   1  I NTRODUCTION  Antenna array calibration is necessary to compensate the array path difference of each channel, mutual coupling effects between the channels and other non-ideal array errors Antenna arrays have been receiving enormous interest in recent decades, and a wide variety of design approaches and applications were proposed over the last five decade They are able to form beams in the directions of desired users and create nulls toward interferences or jamming signals, greatly improving the system’s performance To accurately test the antenna array performance, an accurate calibration of the system was necessary. Antenna array calibration has been extensively studied in the past [47  We i m pr ov ed t h e g en er a ll y a c cep t ed a p p r oa ch es b y introducing an automatic system with a properly defined calibration procedure, thus freeing people from tedious, time consuming calibration process. This automatic calibration system built upon the earlier studies on array calibration for fixed pointing angle would help us to address the effects of mutual coupling as well as permit for the formation of beams without requiring each of them to be individually calibrated [8  I n addi tio n this allo w e d fo r f o r ma tio n o f more complex beam patterns, such as nullsteering beam pattern This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the data model and the procedures used to calibrate antenna array. Section 3 presents the calibration system diagram and the hardware Section 4 presents the experimental evaluation and section 5 provides a summary 2  D ATA M ODEL  If a desired signal from a known direction is chosen then the main beam of the antenna array can be steered towards this direction by simply multiplying each element by a complex weight, corresponding to a phase delay and an amplitude reduction, so that when the channel signals are combined the signal from the desired direction at each element add completely in phase. Shift and sum is the simplest of all spatial filtering schemes for beamforming. Due to various non-ideal array errors such as antenna and RF circuit errors mutual coupling effects between array elements and channels on the beamforming board and distortion of antenna locations, the ideal weight can’t be directly applied to an array to achieve efficient performance  A distortion matrix C generally considered to be independent of angle can be used to encapsulate most of these non-ideal effects      0 0 set measure Cw w  1 Where w measure is measured weight at the array terminals for signal from 0 and w set is the weight the operator sets for the beamformer. This distortion matrix can be estimated from the collected measurement data and will be used to develop a compensated weight for precise beamforming. This technique will not correct angle dependent error and nonlinear effects on the beamformer board. It can only be used for solving the beamformer board mismatch and mutual 


2   coupling problem. Other non-idealities like mutual coupling between the array elements can be taken care of with an additional array head calibration. Our experimental tests have proved that calibration worked pretty well in improving the antenna array performance A beamforming board operating in Rx mode typically has m  input ports that are connected to an m element array head and has one output port that sends the summation of the m channel shifted and attenuated signals to a radio. The proposed calibration process contains three basic steps 1. Determine beamforming weights for Q beams with the existing fixed beam calibration system  For each fixed beam, we will run several loops to converge a set of weight with minimal error. In the first loop, we set the ideal weight to the system. Then we will compare the measured weight with the setting weight and suppress one or two worst channels which have largest deviation of weights from the setting weights. We will repeat this process until the error is within the predefined threshold. To perform the complete calibration for a beamforming board a set of fixed beams were calibrated for Q  independent directions, where Q m      q set q measure Cw w  2  Once the calibration is complete, we record the w set   2. Generate distortion matrix C  This operation was performed through use of an automated LabVIEW interface, resulting in a Q×m data matrix. For q  1, 2 Q construct current m  Q matrix as       1 Q measure measure measure w w W  3        1 Q set set set w w W  4  We have set measure CW W  5  We can compute the distortion matrix as 1 H set set H set ideal W W W W C  6 where the superscript H is conjugate transpose 3 Obtain calibrated weight  To form beam for signal from angle the measured weight should be the ideal weight for that angle, thus the weight set for beamforming is  ideal set w C w 1  7  3  S YSTEM O VERVIEW  To form a specific beam with an antenna array, the current on each antenna must be controlled and set to specific relative values. To accomplish this, a beamformer board was designed to make up the coefficient values. These coefficients are determined using beamforming algorithms that generate a specific phase and attenuation value for each element. The path difference of each channel on the board the mutual coupling effects between the channels and other non-ideal array errors, such as part different must be compensated by calibration Calibration of the beamformer board is accomplished by compensating the phase and attenuation matrix with the individual startup phase and amplitude values each board demonstrates on power-up. This baseline reading is taken with 0 0 phase offset and 0 dB attenuation applied to all the channels. Once the baseline is found, a single channel is chosen to be the reference channel. From this point, the calibration for a fixed beam follows the steps as following 1  Calculate relative phase and amplitude for each element for a specific beam, and select one channel as the reference channel 2  Connect reference channel on the beamforming board to the vector network analyzer \(VNA\and record phase and attenuation 3  Connect different channel of the beamforming board to the VNA 4  Adjust the phase and attenuation on each channel 5  Repeat till all channels have correct reading, i.e the measured weight is very close to the ideal weight. Record the setting weight Repeat the above process for all beams. The manual calibration was quite time consuming due to the repeated connections that needed to be made from the beamformer board to the VNA. The main frustration with the calibration was the iterations needed to account for the mutual coupling of signals between adjacent channels. This coupling caused changes made on one channel to affect the values on other channels. An RF relay board was built to address this problem. The relays allowed all of the beamformer channels to be connected to the VNA with only one active channel feeding the VNA. A relay control board was also designed for choosing active channel with a larger, more easily activated switching method. This helped to replace the manual switches with inputs that can be driven by a computer controlled digital card. The digital cards that were available are the National Instruments NI-DAQ USB-6015 devices that have 24 digital I/O. This control board is also needed to have relay drivers that were designed to handle the fly-back current associated with the switching of the relays. A flow chart and system block diagram for the calibration are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure2 


3   respectively                           To begin the calibration of a beamformer board the operator must first connect the DAQ card to the RF relay control board and the beamformer inputs. The beamformer must then be connected to the VNA and the RF relays. After supplying power to everything and starting up the VNA and starting the calibration VI, the operator inputs the desired parameters into the control panel of the VI as shown in Figure 3. The operator must also setup the VNA as desired using the correct calibration file and frequency settings. The frequency setting are not that important as the VI will control the frequency sweep of the VNA, but the frequencies used must match the frequency range used in the calibration of the VNA    Once all of the input fields have been entered and the user is satisfied that the program is ready to run they click on the start button. At this point, the program will start and requires no further input from the operator. The operator can follow the operation of the program by watching the Figure 1.

After completion of the calibration, the beamformer board is disconnected from the VNA and relays and attached to an antenna array for beam pattern test After approximately one hour, the program finishes and the operator can reset the input fields and the VNA controls to begin calibration of the second mode of operation based on what was calibrated first \(Tx or Rx\. This leads to a total calibration time of around two hours for both transmit and receive     4  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS  A narrowband signal source with a center frequency of 5.8 GHz was placed at far-field from a uniform circular array UCA\. As depicted in Figure 6, the UCA consists of 8 monopoles on top of a ground skirt enabling a dipole like beamforming capabilities.  The array’s electrical size kr is 3.0 where k is the wave number and r is the array radius The inter-element spacing, 0.375  representing the signal wavelength, was designed to provide the best beam in terms of beam-width and antenna gain.  The antenna array was mounted on a rotating table, such that it can record the beam pattern by varying the orientation of the antenna array. The method can be easily extended to any arbitrary shape antenna array The mutual coupling between the array elements were measured with a HP8720D Vector Network Analyzer and the results are shown in table 1. The # is the element number in array; the magnitude \(in dB\he phase \(in degrees the mutual coupling were recorded. Table 1 only shows the magnitude of the mutual coupling. No strong mutual coupling has been found. We have compared the results with and without the array head mutual coupling, no meaningful difference between the beam patterns has been found   Figure 6.

Figure 7 shows an example of the array with the custom made analog beamforming electronics developed by the wireless communication research group at Montana State University MSU  The beamformer consists of an 8 way signal splitter/combiner.  This is a multi-layer design, with odd channels 1, 3, 5, 7 on one side and the even channels 2, 4, 6 8 on the other side, and the ground plane locates between the both sides of the board to minimize the mutual coupling The mutual coupling between the adjacent channels on each side was also minimized to below -10 dB. The path of each channel was well designed such that each channel will have equal length of path on board. Each signal path contains a 6bit digital phase shifter and a 6-bit digital attenuator that are controlled by the Xilinx FPGA.  A Data AcQuisition \(DAQ card is used to communicate the required weights \(phase and attenuation factors\form the desired beam, computed using the proper algorithms, to the FPGA that controls the phase shifters and attenuators.  The weights applied to the currents inducing the antenna array elements can also be immediately loaded to the phase shifters and attenuators from a predefined look-up table  Figure 5.

A 68369A/NV Anritsu signal generator is utilized to generate a 5.8 GHz sine wave that is cabled to the horn antenna for transmitting. The R3273 Advantest spectrum analyzer provides the ability to measure energy at a frequency of interest for displaying beam patterns. All equipment is connected in parallel via a General Purpose Interface BUS GPIB\and routed to a central desktop PC for ease of control and measurement data capture   The LabVIEW GUI PC interface for the automatic calibration system contains control panel and indicator page are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The inputs of the control panel include Beamforming Parameters  Spectrum Analyzer  and Calibration File sections The Beamforming Parameters section contains inputs which affect the beamforming weights and communication with the beamforming board. The Tx/Rx button determines whether transmission or receiving weights should be used for beamforming. The Array Type button selects either linear or circular array The Start and Stop buttons are the control buttons for the calibration process. The Number of Beam  selects the number of beams Q for fixed beam calibration Beam angle sets the predefined beam angles. The Elevation Angle button selects the elevation angle of the beamforming The default value is 90°. The Number of Elements refers to the number of elements in the antenna array. The Electrical Size refers to the dimension of the array. In our simulated study the number of beams is 16, the element number is 8 the electrical size is 3.05. The Spectrum Analyzer section contains the center of the operation frequency as well as the start and stop frequencies. Here we select 5.8GHz as the center frequency whereas the start and stop frequencies offset 500 MHz from the center frequency. The Calibration File is where the calibrated values are stored. The indicator page shows calibration for each predefined fixed beams. It shows the ideal array weights and the measured array weights after calibration and the error. The running errors including Matlab code error, Network Analyzer setting error and other system errors, can be seen during the process The calibration results were highly promising. The highest sidelobe was reduced on an average by 2.5dB compared to the uncalibrated beam and sidelobe length in case of calibrated beams was almost equal to the ideal simulation We also achieved greater pointing angle accuracy, the average pointing angle error was as less 0.15 degrees.    We were also able to produce narrower beams with a half power beam width equal to 40 degrees. While calibrating, we also accounted for the mutual coupling between the elements but our beamforming array was well designed for compensating the channel difference and mutual coupling hence there was no significant impact of mutual coupling in the beam forming. Figure 9 shows all the measured beam patterns plotted between 0 degrees and 360 degrees with a 45degrees step size   All the beams in the plot are normalized. In Figure 10, we try to show the impact of the non-idealities on the antenna array performance for pointing angle at 180°. If we look at the uncalibrated measured plot without considering the mutual coupling and the uncalibrated measured plot, they are almost similar. The black trace is simulated pattern without considering mutual coupling\he blue trace is the measured beam pattern for antenna array without calibration, the red trace is the simulated beam pattern considering mutual coupling and the green trace is measured beam pattern without considering mutual coupling. Figure 11 shows the effect of calibration on the array system Figure 8. Beam pattern test set up Figure 9. Normalized measured beam patterns

We can also observe that side lobe length of the red trace \(calibrated\and the blue trace ideal simulation are almost same proving that calibration has improved the array system performance         5  S UMMARY  Experimental results have showed that beam patterns can achieve their theoretically expected performances only if the non-ideal array behavior is appropriately compensated We have developed an automatic calibration system for beamforming antenna array. It is time saving, easy to operate and accurate. The test results show that the calibrated array has a much improved beam pattern comparing with the one without calibration and it is very close to the simulated pattern R EFERENCES  1  J. C.
