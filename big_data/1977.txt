 Abstract The dynamic of complex social networks is nowadays one of the research areas of growing importance The knowledge about the temporal changes of the network topology and characteristics is crucial in networked communication systems in which accurate predictions are important. In this paper a physics-inspired method to track the changes within complex social network is proposed. This method is based on the dynamic molecular modelling technique used in physics for simulation of large sets of interacting particles. The data for the conducted research was derived from e-mail communication within big company \(Wroclaw University of Technology\. From this information the social network of employees was extracted. The created social network was utilized to evaluate the methodology of social network dynamics modelling proposed by authors I I NTRODUCTION HE emergence of complex behaviour in a system composed of many interacting elements \(frequently referred to as agents\ one of the most fascinating phenomena of the world and also a prominent area of research. There are many types of complex networked systems, for which we have no commonly accepted definition but there is an agreement that such structure consists of multiple interacting components whose global behaviour cannot be simply inferred from the behaviour of the components h e ele m e nts of t h e n e t w ork are n o t independent beings but they are connected via relationships and in consequence they influence one another. The great challenge is to identify, which component influences the way in which another component behaves. The social networks are the example of such complex systems in which tracking changes is very challenging and resource consuming task Due to the scale and complexity of such systems computer simulations became increasingly popular tool utilized in order to investigate these kind of systems Simulations supplement the traditional approaches  – formal theories and empirical studies, as well as they serve as analytical models, which enable to make certain predictions about the future system’s behaviour.

A methodology of constructing the model which serves to predict the changes in large email-based social network is proposed.

discovering the parameters of social network’s molecular model and section 6 includes the experiments conducted on the e-mail based social network derived from the e-mail logs II CREATING AN EMAIL-BASED SOCIAL NETWORK The network that has been chosen for experiments, was extracted from the email logs of Wroclaw University of Technology \(WUT\The experimental data were collected during the period of 21 months \(February 2006 – October 2007\The network was created in the course of the data cleansing process and removing fake and external email addresses. The employees of WUT nodes of the network whereas emails sent to each other by the employees of WUT were used to infer their relationships. These connections between people became edges in the network Note that although every single email provides information about the sender activity, it can simultaneously be sent to many recipients. An email sent to only one person reflects strong attention of the sender directed to this recipient. The same email sent to 20 people does not respect each individual recipient so much. For that reason, the strength of email communication S  x, y rom email user x to y has been defined in the following way        1    1    y x EM card i i y x n y x S   1  where EM  x  y e set of all email messages sent by x to y  n i  x  y the number of all recipients of the i th email sent from x to y  In consequence, every email with more than one recipient is treated as 1 n of a regular one n is the number of its recipients\Although “to-list” recipients are likely to be of much greater message-network importance than “cc-list recipients, both groups are treated in the same way, i.e. just the number of all recipients of the email, regardless that fact in which “to” or “cc” list recipient occurs, are taken into consideration. Such approach result from the fact that the data we obtain does not include information if the recipient of the email is on the “to-list” or “cc-list The strength of the relationship RS  x  y een x and y is calculated as follows         x n y x S y x RS   2  where n  x e total number of emails sent by user x was introduced. The value of this function is from rang  The resulting social network SN  N, RS is defined as a tuple consisting of the set of network nodes N and a set of weighted relationships RS  N  N 0,1 gi ve n b y t h e equation 2. The social distance between two neighbouring nodes is defined as the value of RS complemented to one The above scheme will serve as input data to create 60 temporal images of social network addressed in section 6 III D YNAMIC M OLECULAR M ODELLING Dynamic molecular modelling is one of simulation methods widely used in physics. Simulations are very important because of the fact that many physical problems are too complex to obtain an analytical solution for them. One of them is a class called many-body problems. Whenever we are interested in a dynamic of physical system that contains of many interacting objects we are dealing with a manybody problem. Molecular dynamic modelling is a powerful method that serves to describe the characteristics of such systems as well as their current and future behaviour.. It is important that starting point for those simulations is a microscopic scale \(a position and velocity of each particle but it provides a macroscopic characteristics of the system obtained based on rules and laws of statistical mechanics e.g. temperature, energy, specific heat of the system etc Each physical system consists of many interacting objects e.g. particles and their initial positions and velocity must be set in order to start simulations. They can be chosen freely Two conditions need to be fulfilled before the simulation will be launched:  \(i\wo particles cannot have the same position and \(ii\e overall velocity of the system in each direction should be equal zero. This ought to be done to assure on the one hand that the system is not moving as a whole, but on the other hand that each part of it is moving independently One of the physical parameter of the system is the density of the particles that is defined as V N     3  where N the number of particles \(in our case: the nodes of social network V the size of the system \(volume for three dimensions and area for two The density is important, because it gives information about the state of the system \(whether it is a solid, liquid or gas\. On the other hand, there are some simulation parameters: the value and number of time steps. Moreover the interaction between particles should be described. The interaction is usually given by a two-particle potential meaning that each two particles are interacting\, which depends on the distance between the particles and some characteristics of objects in the system \(e.g. their mass charge etc.\r approach assumes that the potential reflects the tendency of two particles \(nodes\hange their distance in social space. The potential is commonly known as an analytical formula obtained from either theory or experiment \(phenomenologicaly\, e.g. Coulomb potential for charged particles, Lenard-Jones’s potential. During our experiments the character of the potential will be estimated on the basis of the given history of social network \(past evolution which is known\ased on the potential the force acting between particles can be calculated using the following formula 554 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 


U F    4  where U the interaction potential If the force is known, the time evolution of the system can be obtained by solving for each particle separately the classical equation of motion \(2 nd Newton’s principle of dynamics  F dt dp   5  where p the momentum of the particle F a vector sum of forces from all other particles in  the system For objects with constant mass this formula takes the following form 2 2 dt r d m a m F    6  by using the definition of the momentum and acceleration a which is defined as a second derivative of the position vector r ring the simulation above equation must be solved for each particle in each simulation step. This set of equations are solved by numerical integration using existing algorithms \(e.g. Euler’s method, Verlet’s algorithm This method is fully deterministic and allows to predict changes of particles’ positions in time – the time evolution of considered system. The unquestionable advantage of molecular dynamic modelling is that the simulation step is directly connected with time, so we are able to obtain the time evolution of the system in contrary to other simulation methods, e.g.  Monte Carlo simulation IV M OLECULAR SIMULATION To verify the created molecular model \(see Section 3 theoretically obtained data are needed. It is possible to calculate the positions of all particles after given time using the Verlet’s algorithm. Input data indispensable for starting the algorithm are: initial positions of all particles, number of particles, formula for interaction force between each two particles. The number of time steps and the time interval between those steps can also be set. Usage of an additional parameter is possible – it is called the cut-off radius and defines the nearest neighbourhood for each and every particle, meaning the maximum distance of influence. The assumption is that if two particles that are away from each other for a distance bigger than the cut-off radius, do not interact. This parameter is extremely important for large simulation when the number of particles is too big for taking all interactions into consideration This radius should be large enough to treat the interactions with more distant particles as unimportant. It is possible to introduce this parameter only if the interactions shows short-range character The essential part of the procedure, from the conceptual point of view, is the formula used to describe interactions between the particles. This force is identical for all two interacting particles within the system. Additionally, this force depends only on the distance between the particles. To model the described system the Lennard-Jones potential is utilized    6 12 4 r r r V     7  where r the distance between particles The character of the potential is shown below \(Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Lennard-Jones potential Above potential is fully described by two parameters: the depth of the potential  responsible for  the strength of interactions between particles  and  related to the minimum distance between to particles. As it can be seen the potential has a global minimum equal  for r min 2 1/6 1 12  Other characteristic features of this potential are as follows: \(i\when the distance between the particles grows to infinity the value of the potential aims zero asymptotically, \(ii\or smaller distances the particles are attracting each other. In such a case the potential gains the minimum, which is the most stable configuration. For distances smaller then  the character of the potential changes to strongly repulsive To obtain the formula for the force between two interacting particles the partial derivative of potential should be taken. It can be easily calculates analytically           8 14 2 8 14 2 48 48 ij ij j i ij y ij ij j i ij x r r y y r F r r x x r F          8  where x  y mark the particular component of the force vector r ij is the distance between two interacting particles 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 555 


The next step is to transform the forces into dimensionless form. This way the magnitude of used values, normally extremely small, are better represented in a computer and the operations on them can be more precise. To do this the distances are introduced in  units and time in    48 2 m  where m is the mass of interacting particles. As a first approximation the masses of all particles are taken equal 1 Now as the interaction force between each two particles is known we can move on to the Verlet’s algorithm. This algorithm is used to integrate the equation of motion for each and every particle in the system F dt r d m  2 2  9  The second derivative should be discretized using e.g. the three-point formula based on the Tylor’s expansion. The algorithm allows us to obtain the position and the velocity of each particle in following time steps  h m h t F t F t v h t v h m t F h t v t r h t r             2         2       2  10  where h the magnitude of the time step The main part of the algorithm is the time step loop. First the initial forces acting on each particle on the basis of their initial positions are calculated. The force acting on a single particle is the sum of forces originating from all the other particles in the system. After that, the positions of the particles can be calculated. The new positions are used to obtain the forces in an actual step which are required for velocity calculations, because positions depend only on variables’ values in the previous time step whereas the velocities depend also on the forces in the actual time step This procedure is repeated in every time step. As an output this algorithm returns the positions and velocities \(velocities are not crucial for the interpretation in our case, at least during the first experiments\ of all particles in the system in following time steps To compare the experimental data with model discussed above the positions of the particles should be generated for the same time step as in the experiment. Then the standard deviation of the two data series for each time step need to be calculated and optimized. By optimization process the adjustment to the experimental data is understood. This can be proceed by optimizing the value of the parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential. Values of this parameters can be changed in wide range to minimize the standard deviation between the theoretical and experimental data V M OLECULAR MODEL OF SOCIAL NETWORK Application of the molecular dynamics to social network modelling requires completing several tasks which will be defined in the further subsections The overall methodology assumes the four main stages 1. Creating temporal images of social network 2. Embedding created social network graph in 2D 3D Euclidean space 3. Estimating the character of social force potential between network nodes 4. Using dynamic molecular modelling to predict the evolution of the network A Creating temporal images of the social network It should be emphasized that the social network derived from the e-mail logs is not a static structure. The existence of any link in such a graph \(i.e. relationship\ is a result of a series of discrete events \(sending e-mail messages\ which occur in certain moments and \(usually\ with changing frequency. We may also think of the computed relationships’ strengths as of the social distance between network members \(nodes Greater RS reflects smaller distance in social space. In order to track changes in relationship strength we used the sliding time frame approach. Mail server log data from the period of 21 months \(February 2006 - October 2007\were divided into frames covering one month each, and starting in consecutive moments which differ by ten days This allowed the creation of 60 social network graphs SN  t 0  SN  t 1  SN  t n here t 0 t 1  t n are discrete moments of time and each network is created \(according to the procedure defined in section 3 on the basis of one-month period starting in t 0 t 1  t n In our case t 0  the 1 st of February, 2006  The networks SN  t 0  SN  t 1  SN  t n poral images of evolving social structure which was build on the basis of the entire 21 months-long email communication The relationship strengths are computed for each network separately The similar approach was utilized in w h ere th e  temporal changes of betweenness centrality were tracked for organizational email network of 262 users. The time frame of 30 days moving by one day was used. In our case, due to the size of the system and observed behaviour of several users \(who happened to be inactive for weeks, for example we decided to increase its speed to ten days per step B Embedding networks in Euclidean space Following the in-depth discussion presented in w e  cannot expect the social space to be metric i.e. the triangle inequality between any three nodes may not be fulfilled. On the other hand, molecular modelling assumes the interaction between the particles moving in the Euclidean space. For this reason, in order to apply the molecular modelling we must conduct embedding of the social network graph in metric Euclidean 2D space Numerous methods for completing this task were developed so far; the best will be chosen in the course of 556 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 


experiments, good candidates were proposed in s oc a lle d Big-Bang embedding algorithm\ an a f a st  m e t h od f o r creating 2D representations of large graphs, which consists of two steps: embedding the graph in a very high dimension usually associated with the number of nodes- and then project it into the 2D plane using principal components analysis In this step we embed the graphs SN  t 0  SN  t 1  SN  t n n Euclidean 2D space, where each node is represented by a point with given coordinates. The resulting sets of points SN 0  SN 1  SN n represent the temporal network images Embedding algorithm assures us that the Euclidean distances between points \(nodes\ fit in the best possible way the distances in a social space \(relation strengths in original graphs\ the representation of social system in which the network is seen as an assembly of N particles \(the nodes of social network\. The procedure we have chosen for our experiments was a classic multidimensional scaling algorithm \(MDS  ltidi m ension al scali ng defines a call of methods often used in information visualization and exploring similarities or dissimilarities in data. An MDS algorithm starts with a matrix of similarities between objects \(similarity relation doesn’t have to be symmetrical\en assigns a location of each item in a lowdimensional space. In other words – it estimates the coordinates of a set of objects in a space of specified dimensionality on the basis of measuring the distances which, however do not have to be metric\ between pairs of objects. A variety of models can be used that include different ways of computing distances and various functions relating the distances to the actual data. We computed a square non-symmetical \(because our graph is directed matrix of the distances between the nodes in social graph as an input for the MDS procedure C Setting up the dynamic molecular model Because the sets of network nodes in SN  t 0  SN  t 1  SN  t n are equal, each point \(node\ represented in any of the sets SN 0  SN 1  SN n In fact, in email-based social network it doesn’t have to be so, but to check our model we excluded users which were not continually active \(about 10 of all\from our analysis. It is planned to model dynamic sets of the users in the future model development. active However the position of each node, depending of its  distances to other points, is subject to change. We may think of these points as of the particles moving in result of interactions \(email communication\ between them At this point we use the formalism of molecular dynamics see section 3\sociate a force potential U with any particle \(network node\he actual characteristic of this potential depends on the behaviour of the particles changing their positions in time instants t 0 t 1  t n First experiments were carried using standard Lennard-Jones potential function. The analysis of server logs has revealed some features of the dynamics of email communication – the growing intensity of communication is always followed by the periods of less frequent email activity. This resembles the repelling force emerging between particles when their distance becomes less then some r min We noticed that intense e-mail communication \(which results in very small distances in social graph\ is never sustained for longer time From the other hand fading communication is \(in most cases\ followed by frequent message exchanges. It should be stressed that the Lenard-Jones potential was used only for first experiments, in the next steps we intend to develop social network-specific potential function on the basis of available data The force potentials introduced in section IV allow us to simulate the changes between communication patterns in consecutive time instants. The force potentials associated with the nodes reflect their abilities and tendency to establish future connections with the neighbours – the nodes which are close in terms of social space \(thus changing the distances in social space which is analogous to the behaviour of particles moving under influence of electrical/gravitational forces\at this approach allows also general interpretations because “being close in 2D social space” does not imply direct connection between nodes \(users\elonging to the same clique of the social graph has similar effect VI E XPERIMENTS The experiments were conducted in order to track the temporal changes in the network structure. This was performed by utilizing the time frame of 30 days moving by 10 days. A set of 60 separate \(partially overlapping, as in  f r am e s  w a s created f r o m th e e m ail log s  g a th ered in t h e period of February 2006 – October 2007. As stated above, in order to enable modelling the dynamics via the molecular simulation the users who were active in all 60 periods were chosen and this resulted in the creation of the set of 262 users and the relationships existed between them. This subnetwork was used in the further stages of our experiments Fig. 2 presents the results of running non-metric MDS procedure on the matrix of distances between social graph nodes Fig. 2 Initial positions of 262 particles 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 557 


Molecular simulation was run on the set of particles with initial coordinates as showed on the Fig.2 and assuming that their interactions were characterized by standard LennardJones potential function. However, first results have shown that the exponent 14 in one of the terms of Equation 8 has to be decreased. It was responsible for rapidly growing repelling force between particles close to each other and has to be decreased to 10. After this change in the definition of the potential the system became stable thus allowing further simulations The configuration of particles moving in social space after 100 time steps in shown on Fig.3 Fig. 3 Positions after 100 time steps As we may see from comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the configuration of particles is stable, however their relative positions are changing. The analysis of the results of the first 100 time steps of molecular simulations allowed drawing interesting conclusions about the behavior of the systems of social particles First, there is one important information which cannot be inferred from the above picture. Small number of particles less then 6% of the total 262\ located far outside the area visible on Fig. 3, in few cases with their coordinates exceeding 1.0E+10. This observation led to analysis of their and – afterwards, of all the others\ as the elements of the social graph. We noted that in the case of low node centrality \(i.e. equaling one\he social distance metric may assign extremely close distance between low centrality node and its neighbour.  An interesting conclusion is that the accuracy of the molecular model depends on the position of the nodes within the social graph. We observed that  Nodes with minimal \(i.e. equaling 1\n- and out-degree centrality \(connected only to one neighbor in social network\ when moved to social 2D space tend to approach the other nodes \(particles\ to very short distances. Apparently, this reflects the fact that their relative distance is based only on single social relation This in turn results frequently in the emergence of large repelling force. The particle gains high speed and is thrown out – after that it moves along linear path, in our case the length of simulations was not enough to cause such a particle return in result of attracting force coming from interaction of the others. Obviously, this is not a behavior observed in social space and this feature should be carefully addressed during the future experiments  On the other hand, nodes with high degree centrality were observed to be stable during the interactions with the others In order to check the ability of our model to predict the social distances between particles we checked if there are correlations between node-to-node distances stored in distance matrices generated for all 60 temporal images of considered social network and the distances in 2D social space in consecutive steps of simulation. This was done separately for the four classes of nodes  Class 1 Nodes with degree centrality equaling one. \(with only single connection existing between them and the rest of the network  Class 2 Nodes with high in-degree centrality \(many – at least two – relations pointing to them, zero or one outcoming relations  Class 3 Nodes with high out-degree centrality \(many at least two – relations originating in given node, zero or one incoming relations  Class 4 Nodes with balanced in- and out-degree centrality both equaling at least two In all cases distances between any given node and all its counterparts in the network were computed for all temporal images of social network and the equal number of time steps of the molecular simulation. These vectors of distances were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The average results for the members of the all considered classes are as follows  Class 1 0.0794  Class 2  0.3726  Class 3  0.4311  Class 4  0.6617 We may see that there is visible correlation between the predictions of the model and the behavior of the particles/nodes well-connected to the network. It maybe explained by their communication patterns being dependent from the other members of the community. For the nodes characterized by broadcast type of communication \(outdegree hubs\ or information sinks \(in-degree hubs\ this correlation is not so strong, however visible The communication patterns of the nodes loosely connected to the network are not predictable in terms of the proposed model, their behavior is independent from their network counterparts. During forthcoming experiments this phenomena will be addressed by redefining the social force potential function \(in order to better reflect the data gathered as stated in sec. V.B\d altering the 2D embedding procedure VII C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK The results presented above are preliminary and 558 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 


summarize the first experiments on creating the predictive evolutionary model for large internet-based social networks The same formalism may be also applied to other social networks based on communication technologies, for example, network of mobile phone users etc. There are many details which have to be addressed during future works and experiments. Among them the most important are  Force potential issues The actual shape and equation of the force potential characteristic for given network should be estimated by analysing the history of interactions between pairs of users \(nodes, particles we used “classic”, modified version of the Lennard-Jones potetial. The question if there is one definition of the potential which may be applied to all members of the network remains open  Choosing the time step of the molecular simulation In the case of our first experiments we analysed only simple correlations between changes in the distances in social space and communication graphs of time-changing social network  Dynamically changing sets of network nodes Fading and emergence of the nodes is the usual phenomena in social networks. The future versions of our framework will take it into account as well  2D social graph embedding procedure There are other options which may be applied instead of the MDS used in our simulations. They may also affect the results and the accuracy of the model Future experiments will be carried on larger social networks \(data sets based on logs from a 5000-users corporate server are being prepared for the forthcoming research\d will be preceded by developing methods of tuning the potential equations and the length of time steps The approach proposed in th is article aims to predict the evolution of social net-work of arbitrary size on the basis of known records. The existence of email-based social networks gives us the opportunity to use precise data \(mail server logs\which hold information about the activity of users. As a result it was possible to propose a computational approach with good simulation potential and compatible with known solutions from complex systems field Additionally, our approach was general and may be applied to any internet-based social network \(their size and the length of history records do not impact the procedure However, there are also several challenges and questions that must be answered in order to apply the method with required accuracy A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work was supported by The Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, grant no.

This figure presents the data flow through main blocks that can be used a few times and special blocks that must execute only particular functions Here also Configurator of chain and Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS modules are equipped First one is responsible for right construction of next processing path and second one stores necessary number of elements After signal verification system is reconfigured according to input data and with using the chosen protocol type The OUTPUT connects to radio link and then signal must be transmitted over one of six channel types And at the reception side we configure the receiver in relation to transmitted mode 5 HARDWARE PLATFORM SELECTION Current technologies in a hardware environment allow to test our system in real-time implementation There are a couple of DSP based platforms that can be selected for validation from Lyrtech Inc the Small Form Factor SFF Software Communication Architecture SCA Development the Small Form Factor SFF Softwaredefined Radio SDR Development Platform the Small Form Factor SFF Software-defined Radio SDR Evaluation Module 20 All these platforms are based on TMS320DM6446 DMP SoC from Texas Instruments 21 For the proposed SDR based system we chose the SFFSDR Evaluation board see Figure 13 as far as this platform supports WiMAX technology model based design tools accelerating prototyping implementation of all protocols layers for complete radio stacking extra boards operates with 297MHz ARM926EJ-s RISC CPU and 594MHz C64x DSP in sense of power management this module has MSP430 MCU Due to an availability of Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx 22 this module can perform implementation of full modem processing functions that is very important feature in meaning of multi-protocol architecture of our system We are able to vary our requirements to each protocol inside the same hardware structure Figure 13 SFF SDR development platform by Lyrtech 6 PROTOTYPING THE WiMAX/UMTS SYSTEM The WiMAX/UMTS system is implemented in high-level language as C with the class library The main accent was done on the correct form of the signal processing sequence The path for WiMAX or UMTS signal is determined in the beginning and system should verify its entity leads the system in a relevant direction The main goal of this software implementation is to check how our system can handle the input signal sequence The simulation was carried out for following parameters for each subsystem For UMTS we consider transport block with 1280 bits size frame size is 2400 bits channelization code with 16 chips sequence For WiMAX we generate the bit block is equal to 1280 bits however during channel coding operation this block is divided on turbo coding block that include 384 bits The size of turbo coding block forms from the block determination corresponding modulation type and number of subchannels During software verification we obtained that our proposed model can separate different paths subject to a type of an inter sequence in the software environment The framework of our WiMAX/UMTS system went through one scenario step and now we are directed to an extension of this model For the more detailed system visualization we integrate our C code modules into MATLAB library by means of proper dynamic linking libraries dll compiled by using the MATLAB C compiler Each block can be formed with extended parameters Modules with C code configurate the system work in a host This host implementation will present a prototype This prototype will help to analyze future real-time hardware implementation MATLAB prototype can also provide debugging of real system the result of real system must be equal to our MATLAB prototype Next step of the work development and verification is to implement it into the hardware platform based on DSP DSP based platform allows to organize signal processing in a digital presentation that serves SDR based part of our general system 7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we considered the framework of WiMAX/UMTS baseband level system for mobile device in UL transmission direction We presented the different signal processing structures based on OFDM and WCDMA physical layer procedures Our research work is mainly devoted to developing the approach of seamless switching between different subsystems that can be realized by SDR technology implementation To this end we proposed a possible solution to allow coexistence of different data transmission technologies 11

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
