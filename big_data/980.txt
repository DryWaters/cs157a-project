McMillin ttgdp5@mst.edu, ff@mst.edu Department of Computer Science Intelligent Systems Center &amp; Energy Research and Development Center Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO 65409-0350 Abstract Deeply embedded infrastructures are pervasive systems that have signi?cant cyber and physical components, interacting with each other in complex ways. These interactions can violate a system  s security policy leading to unintended information ?ow. Execution Monitor \(EM is the concept of monitoring a system during runtime for any security policy violations and terminating the execution if such violations occur. EM enforceable mechanisms require that the properties being enforced be restricted to safety properties. Information ?ow properties are considered non-EM enforceable because they can not be de?ned using safety properties. To bridge this gap, prior work has presented a monitor that predicts future possible events then evaluates these as safety properties. Unfortunately, in a pervasive system, evaluating future possible events results in a physical, observable, change to the system. What is needed is a physical  undo  operation in which a physical setting can be explored, then undone in a way that no unintended information ?ow results. This paper presents the concepts of compensating events and a compensating couple which can be used to EM enforce information ?ow properties in pervasive systems 1 Introduction With the advances in information systems and communication networks, it has become very evident that in near future, everything including humans, will be  plugged-in  or  connected  either directly or indirectly. Although in many aspects this is quite bene?cial in our day to day life, the heavy integration of physical systems with cyber systems This work was supported in part by NSF MRI award CNS-0420869 CSR award CCF-0614633, ERC award EEC-08212121 and in part by the Missouri S&amp;T Intelligent Systems and Energy Research and Development Centers introduce many security concerns as well. For example consider a pervasive gas pipeline that transports a commodity \(gas is in control of a certain section of the pipeline and is expected to have access to the gas ?ow information, but only of that speci?c section. Unfortunately, due to the interconnected nature of pipelines, any cyber interactions within the pipeline result in observable changes in the pipeline ?ow leaking information about the cyber interactions In another example, consider a smart house - a house controlled and monitored by an automated system for the purpose of user convenience, security and energy ef?ciency Here, various aspects of the house such as power, security and temperature could be controlled either via an in-house computer system or with the use of remote means. Once a smart house has been con?gured, the occupants of the house will be given certain usage and administrative rights to the system. In doing so, the system is supposed to prevent nonoccupants of the house from acquiring various status information \(such as power usage level, temperature level, number of occupants present, number of open/closed doors or windows, etc ing outside the house is still capable of deriving certain information about the house just by merely observing it. Here again it can be seen that observable physical changes in a system compromising information security Even though a system can be designed to be secure, run time issues in the system can invalidate development time assumptions. As more and more physical systems are integrated with cyber systems, these risks grows exponentially 


grated with cyber systems, these risks grows exponentially in the cyber world, systems interact and communicate with other systems, allowing even more indirect security attacks This is not because of carelessness of design or pure implementation ?aws, but simply because such situations were not considered possibilities during the development phase of the system. The primary concept behind Execution Monitoring \(EM policy violations when a system is  live, up-and-running  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE and take appropriate actions In this paper, we propose a new approach to EM enforce information ?ow properties in pervasive systems. In section 2, we present some of the background information and related work in the area of EM enforceability. This is followed up by a discussion on enforcing information ?ow properties in pervasive systems in section 3. We provide two possible ways of enforcing information ?ow properties in pervasive systems. In section 4, we introduce our sample pervasive system and the mathematical groundwork required for our proof including a case study of an actual information ?ow violation. In section 5, we formally de?ne the concept of compensating events and compensating couple. Section 6 presents the compensating automata for pervasive systems followed by a summary and a discussion in section 7 2 Run Time Evaluation and Enforcement of Security Policies Assumptions made at development time might lead to security being compromised at runtime. Added to this are the physical characteristics of systems. Some of the reasons for such compromise are [1] hardware failures, speci?c design considerations and requirements and unforeseen changes in the supporting systems due to interaction with other systems. Execution Monitoring \(EM  monitoring the execution? steps of a particular concurrent system at runtime, detection of enforced security policy violations and terminating the execution upon a violation. Security policies are de?ned for properties. By de?nition, a property [3] is a set of executions. A security policy is yet another way of de?ning properties; A security policy is a set of executions where each execution in the set satis?es a certain predicate where membership is determined on individual execution basis According to Schneider [2], for a certain security policy to be enforced, it needs to be a safety property. Safety properties are based on three requirements. In essence these requirements are \(1 the set de?ned for the particular property - individually being safe, \(2 ecution needs to maintain safety throughout each step and lastly, \(3 identi?able point There are security properties in existence which can not be de?ned using the de?nition of a safety property. Since security policies are only de?ned for safety properties, a certain range of interesting security properties are limited from being enforced. As pointed out by [4] and [5], information ?ow properties can not be expressed using the An execution is termed as an in?nite sequence of states.[3, 2 Alpern and Schneider framework [3]; these properties can not be enforced with the security automata described by Schneider. Information ?ow properties  includes noninterference [6], noninference [7], nondeducibility [8], etc. Also the pre?x closed feature is a strong requirement which does not allow making predictions, or in other words, looking into the future to see how the execution will continue to behave. This is not a simple limitation; an execution which may seem to violate the policy at present, might actually end up being safe and complete its task if allowed to con 


end up being safe and complete its task if allowed to continue. Specially, when it comes to information ?ow properties, imposing such a hard limit on executions may end up not achieving the desired ?nal state in any of the executions 3 Enforcing Information Flow Properties Information ?ow properties are not de?ned over a set of executions [4] rather over sets of execution sets. This leads to a conclusion that the decision to terminate an execution can not be purely based on a detected violation of a single execution. In order to EM enforce information ?ow properties, the existing EM enforceable mechanisms needs to be extended. Two possibilities are 1. Providing a prediction mechanism for the future steps 2. Allow the execution to continue and taking counter measures if violations occur 3.1 Predicting the future The ?rst approach is to extend the existing security automata with a prediction mechanism. The purpose of the prediction mechanism is to enumerate through all possible future executions paths and determine the viable\(safe state\(s to continue on to one of the safe states, the policy is considered violated and the the execution is terminated. Using this concept, Nagatou and Watanabe [9] have presented a runtime covert channel detection mechanism. In doing so they extended the basic security automata for EM enforceable mechanisms by predicting the future. The underlying concept of their extended security automata is the unwinding theorem. The unwinding theorem allows appending an individual safe state to an sequence of states which has already been determined as secure. An execution monitor explores possible next states of the security automata. However, for the physical portion of the system, exploring the next state can lead to a side effect of observable actions that cannot be undone if this next state is found to be unsafe  These properties are also termed as  possibilistic security properties [4 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 3.2 Counter Measures As pointed out earlier, if information ?ow properties are to be EM enforced, it is not reasonable to terminate the execution whenever a violation is detected; the information in question has already ?owed. If a prediction mechanism is not present, the other alternative is to allow execution to continue and take appropriate counter actions. These counter actions could be either to rollback to a previous safe state and resume the execution from that point onwards or replace the rest of the execution with a pre-determined safe sequence  or introduce counter events \(named compensating events here afterwards expressing counter events in the physical part of the system is addressed in the next section 4 Compensating Events in Pervasive Systems In this paper, our focus is showing that the concept of compensating events can be used in enforcing information ow properties. In particular, we are interested in enforcing these in pervasive systems - systems with both cyber components and physical components. We consider the gas distribution network as our example pervasive system. Figure 1 shows a particular subsection of a gas distribution network. Here, three different distributors A,B and C control three sections of the pipeline. The pipeline represents the physical layer of the system. The Remote Terminal Unit RTI the cyber layer. The RTI is used to acquire the state of gas read operation write operation a Human Machine Interface \(HMI lar set of RTIs connected to that HMI. The HMI acts as the cyber component of the system while RTI stands the mid 


cyber component of the system while RTI stands the middle ground. Similar applications can be found in water and power distribution networks [10] as well In the pipeline system, as noted in the introduction changes in one part of the system are re?ected in other parts of the system. From basic laws of ?uid ?ow it can be seen that, at steady state fA = fB + fC where fs is the amount of gas ?ow in pipe section s. Suppose now B lowers the ?ow in section B to fB ? f ? by changing valve positions at RTUB . In order to maintain the overall gas ?ow stability of the pipeline network, either fA and/or fC will have to be re-adjusted to new stable values  This actually seems like a basic violation of the de?nition of a safety property. But, information ?ow properties can not directly be de?ned using safety/liveness [3] thus, a single trace level approximation de?ned for safety does not apply here Figure 1. A Subsection of the Gas Distributing Network with different distributors controlling different sections of the pipeline The aggregated change adopted by the rest of the network f could be any of the followings f = {f ??fA} or f ??fC} or fA and ??fC : | ?? ? |= f where ? and ? indicate increase or decrease in ?ow, respectively. Note that there are other similar possible combinations for the last case of ?f . In order to formally de?ne compensation, we introduce the following de?nitions based on de?nitions of a state machine[11] and state space[4 found in literature De?nition \(State Machine S = {s1, s2, . . .} set of subjects, Q = {q1, q2, . . .} set of system states, I = {i1, i2, . . .} set of inputs and O o1, o2, . . .} set of system outputs. Associated with each system state qi is a set of state variables. An element of output oi ? O represents a snapshot of the all state variables at a particular instance. Changes to the state variables occur due to a subset of inputs C ? I called state transition commands. Thus, a state transition command will transition the state machine to a new state with a new\(or modi?ed of state variables. In addition, there are input commands which do not affect state changes, denoted by the set Z ? I A command is always triggered by a subject who is in a certain protection domain\(de?ned below Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 Corresponding to the pipeline model presented above, a command z represents a read operation while a command c represents a write operation. The state transition function T : C  Q ? Q de?nes executing command ci ? C over the state qj which transits the system to a new state qk. A sequence of state transition commands C? would produce a sequence of state transitions T ? : C  Q ? Q. With each state transition, a new set of state variables is added to O which is denoted by the output function P : C  Q ? O Correspondingly, C? would produce a sequence of outputs P ? : C  Q ? O De?nition \(Trace general de?nition helps de?ning a history of events for a state machine over a certain range. The range here could be a certain time period or system steps. Since C,Z ? I an element i ? ? could cause either a state transition or merely an output of state variables. Thus, an element of provides an abstract view of commands and outputs of the state machine at a particular instance. The trace space set is the set of all possible traces for the state machine We introduce D = {d1, d2, . . .} which is a set of protection domains. Associated with each protection domain is a set of subjects called a group. Without loss of generality the partial ordering dG? &lt; dG denotes that information ?ow 


the partial ordering dG? &lt; dG denotes that information ?ow is prohibited from group G ? S to another distinct group G? ? S. The domain in which a particular input is executed is represented as dom\(i De?nition \(Projection the sequence of output a group G is authorized to observe This is formally represented as proj\(G, ?, qi the originating state for the trace. By de?nition a projection is a re?ned sequence of output denoted proj\(G, ?, qi De?nition \(Purge ements in the trace that corresponds to the purging condition. For example, ?G sponding to the group G. The purging could also be done on certain set of inputs. For example, ?C   all inputs which are not state transition commands. What this will leave a sequence of state transition commands so C   4.1 Case Study: Violations of Information Flow Properties To facilitate developing a basis for compensation, we present the following case study. We use the same example presented in Figure 1. Here, the subjects S = {A,B,C} are the distributors and the input I = {reads, write?s , write?s are the possible commands on RTIs where s ? S. Suppose the system is in a stable state qk when input write?B\(f curs. As seen from ?f , there are multiple ways of achieving next stable state but, for the simplicity of explanation let  s assume the following two traces i = {readC f  f  j = {readC f f   De?ne G? = {C} and G = {A,B} and dG? &lt; dG meaning information ?ow is prohibited from G to G?. For noninterference to hold, the outputs a certain group of subjects can see should corresponds to inputs allowed to see 11]. Mathematically, this is stated as proj\(G?, ?i, qk G?, ?G\(?i Let  s take two projections for G proj\(G?, ?G\(?i 1 + f 1 proj\(G?, ?G\(?j 2 Although with accordance to the de?nition of noninterference, subjects in G? are not suppose to know about the actions of G, the projection on ?i provides enough information to derive that some change has occurred in the system Also, actions of G has affected the output for G? leading to interference. If there weren  t any interference, \(1 equal fC , fC , fC . But the purged projection of ?i does not agree the equation. This contradicts with the information ow restriction between the two groups. At the same time looking at \(2 mation. Here, although there were changes in the system, it is not visible, thus, it seems that there weren  t any change What this means is, by ordering the events in a certain way it is still possible to keep a secret from disseminating outside a protection domain 5 Event Compensation Our argument is, in order to enforce information ?ow properties in pervasive systems, the two aspects \(the cyber aspect and the physical aspect and just considering one aspect alone is neither suf?cient nor reasonable. By looking at \(1 2 at the end of both traces, the value of fC has returned to the original value as if nothing has happened. This was possible because the effect of input write?B\(f has been compensated by the effect of write?A\(f thermore, both these commands were issued by members of the same group. Lets assume that at state qk, the system is information ?ow safe and there exists a trace ?k which represents a history of information ?ow safe sequence of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 state transition commands on the system up until the stable 


state transition commands on the system up until the stable state. This can be formally de?ned as ck = ?C  k proj\(G?, ck, q0 G?, ?G\(ck where q0 is the start state. We only consider state transition commands here since non-state transition commands such as read operations does not change the state variables. We de?ne compensating couple as two consecutive compensating state transition commands both issued by subjects in the same protection domain. Let  s consider two state transition commands cs1 , c?s2 by subjects s1, s2. If ck was extended to ck+1 = ck + cs1 + c  s2 by appending a compensating couple cs1 , c?s2 , it can be seen that for both s1, s2 ? G and s1, s2 ? G proj\(G?, ck+1, q0 G?, ?G\(ck+1 which preserves the de?nition of noninterference. At the same time, subjects in G? are unaware of any event occurrences in G. This in turn is a preservation of noninference security. In a noninference secure system, low level subjects are left in doubt as to whether or not any high level events have occurred. With corresponds to our model system, the objective would be to hide the collaborate actions of A and B from C. Thus, by taking cs1 ? write?B\(f and cs2 ? write?A\(f state transition command sequence ck is extended to ck+1 without violating noninterference. Event compensation disallows certain traces from continuing thus, all the allowed traces preserve the above noninference property. Further, a certain compensated trace after purging high level events is still a valid\(legal stated as G From the above analysis, it can be stated that noninterference as well as noninference can be preserved with event compensation. As a result, certain weaker information ?ow properties \(compared to above also preserved by the same concept In a purely cyber system, a compensating couple would represent event undo and in a pure physical world, this represents event complement. In a pervasive system two subjects would ?rst establish a secure connection and exchange information regarding a event undo. Once an agreement is reached, both parties would ensure that a compensating couple is executed. This will ensure other subjects outside the protection domain are kept unaware of the changes. At most, a third party may be able to observe a sudden pulse as shown in Figure 2, but this kind of a discrete pulse could arise due to other natural causes as well  The objective of  an air bubble or a clog in the pipeline, lighting striking a power transmission line etc the two communicating parties would be to make the period of vulnerability as minimum as possible by making a pre-compensation agreement and a commitment for action Figure 2. A Short Discrete Vulnerable Period in a Information Flow Secure Environment In active pervasive systems, event compensation does make sense because, commands that affect the equilibrium of the system \(write operations other events to maintain stability. That is, an isolated state transition command executed on the system is sure to break the equilibrium of the system and potentially leak information on a state change. For example, if distributor B is required to lower its gas ?ow due to some reason, this has to be ?rst conveyed to the main distributor A, if B wants to keep the secret from leaking to other competitive distributors like C. Compensating couples help maintain stability while making sure unauthorized information dissemination is prevented outside the protection domain of execution. In between the execution of the compensating couple, the system reaches a non-stable\(vulnerable see Figure 2 


tem reaches a non-stable\(vulnerable see Figure 2 and once this occurs, the security automata iterates through all possible next state transition commands \(similar to what is shown in?f the event which would makeup a compensating couple On top of this matching command search is the actual cyber communication and the agreement for compensation occurring between two parties The compensating couple can also be viewed as a request-reply message passing between two subjects. Using the communication network, si requests sj that he intends to execute a state transition command. sj could decide either to acknowledge\(reply agreement has been made, si could issue the ?rst command of the compensating couple while this will be followed up by the matching command by sj . If ignored, the originating party could wait for a certain pre-de?ned response time and make a re-attempt Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 6 Monitoring for Compensation The security automata presented in [2] and the extended security automata in [9] are both based on executions being pre?x closed. Pre?x closed-ness does not directly apply for compensation as the ?rst command of a compensating couple leads the state machine into a vulnerable state. Nevertheless, the objective is, once the state machine reaches a non-safe state, to make sure that the next command preserves compensation and leads the state machine back to a stable\(safe tended predicate for selecting the next state For the same state machine de?ned previously, we introduce the compensation automata as follows. The state space Q is divided into two sets. W ? Q is the set of stable\(safe unsafe states De?nition \(Compensation Automata automata consists of 5-tuples \(Q,Q0, I ?, ?,W  Q is a set automaton states  Q0 is a set of initial states for the automaton Q0 ? Q  I ? is a set of input symbols of the form \(ci?1, ci ci?1, ci ? C  is the a state transition function ? : Q  I ? ? 2Q speci?ed with predicates  W is a set of ?nal states W ? Q The input symbol \(ci?1, ci command and the next state transition command under the read head. Initially, ci?1 = ? meaning, at the very start there is no input command. It is assumed that due to ci?1 the state machine has already transit to qi ? Q. if qi ? W, ci is the reply part of an earlier compensating couple. On the other hand, if qi ? V, ci denotes request part of a new compensating couple The automaton starts in q0 ? Q0 and then changes to the next state qj ? Q? based on the input symbol. The set of all possible next states are given as  q?Q q, ci is de?ned with a set of predicates. If q0 ? W , the predicate is comparatively simple. The latest executed state transition command part ci?1 of the input symbol is ignored and the next state qj is accepted with the condition that two subjects have agreed to execute a compensating couple. Formally, this can be represented as qj | qi ? Q? ? \(agreed := true here agreed is pre-compensation agreement between two subjects to honor a compensating couple If q0 ? V , the next possible set of states are further re?ned. Here, one half of the compensating couple has already been issued and the system has reached a non-safe 


ready been issued and the system has reached a non-safe state. The predicate must ensure to maintain the compensation. This is formally represented as qj | qi ? Q? ? qi ? W ? \(dom\(ci?1 ci ci ? ci?1 ci ? ci?1 = ?? is the effect of compensation. Here, the next command ci needs to lead the state machine to a stable state as well as compensate for the previous state transition command. In addition, the domain in which the next command is going to be executed needs to be equivalent to the domain of the previous command as well. The domain equivalency does not necessarily has to be a requirement of two commands issued in the same domain but, at least they should be compatible with each other. Notice here, we are not considering the pre-compensation agreement. Chances are, one party in the original agreement might have decided to pull-out of the agreement; In such a situation, the originating party needs to present an anti-transition command which is equivalent to the matching compensation command promised by the second party If Q? is not empty, the command sequence can be accepted and a state transition is possible. The validated transition command ci can be proposed  to be executed in the actual physical system. If ci is leaving a non-safe state the state machine ensures it reaches a safe state in the next step and information ?ow between undesired protection domains is prevented 7 Summary and Discussion In this paper, we have shown that the concept of compensating events and compensating couple can be used to make information ?ow properties being enforced in pervasive systems. The concept of compensation relies on secure communication between intended parties in pre-compensation period as well as the total commitment of both parties. Although some information can be leaked to unauthorized users, we argue that the period of vulnerability can be minimized. Added to the fact is that, in actual physical systems such brief changes could also arise due to many other natural and physical causes as well so, as information ?ow is concerned, it is still possible to maintain information ?ow security properties This concept would appear to be applicable to other transportation networks such as electric power or water ow, but not applicable to ground or air vehicle movements  similar proposals are made in [2] and in [9 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 The reason is that the latter two infrastructures contain a sense of direction and it is physically infeasible to  back up  a vehicle to undo an action References 1] C.

Discussion and conclusion  6.1. Discussion of findings  The secondary data analyses in this study were able to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between the institutional environment and e-commerce adoption.  Specifically speaking, the legal and policy environment did exert a substantial positive impact on e-commerce adoption around the world at the early stage of e-commerce \(the worldwide average score of e-commerce was only 5.51 out of 10 in the EIU 2003 sample government financial support of e-commerce and related infrastructure projects, effectiveness of legal framework, and laws covering e-commerce, together they fostered consumers and businesses in many countries to engage in e-commerce in 2003.  This finding proved the institutional perspective about the critical role of government policy and legal environment in driving e-commerce adoption Four years later, in 2007, the global average score of e-commerce improved from 5.51 to 6.37, at a rate of 16%.  As e-commerce became more prevalent in the world, supportive government policy still provided a powerful explanation for variations in e-commerce adoption around the world.  On the other hand, the impact of legal environment was reduced.  A possible explanation from the perspective of institutionalism is that a predictive and effective legal environment was important to reduce the institutional uncertainty and ensure the trust and confidence in e-commerce activities, especially during the initial stage of ecommerce development.  A good legal system is a safeguard for online commercial transactions Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal 


Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i 


i models into time and covariate dependent dynamic counterparts  ii models and reliability analysis in a more realistic manner  iii level  whether or not functional components \(loyal generals diagnose correctly and take proper actions such as fault mask of failed components \(traitors asymmetric  iv survivability analysis. Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
