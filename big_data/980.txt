Morris  Yuyu Zhou Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics  Yi Liu Chinese Academy of Sciences  Abstract  With the development of science, remote data visualization is playing an increasingly important role Meanwhile working on the road is becoming the life style of modern society However, handicapped by the limits of the mobile embedded device and mass data to 
be visualized, the remote data visualization for mobile clients is still a big challenge. In this paper, we enhance our previously developed web-based tool to support mobile collaborative research of atmospheric nucleation processes. The paper shows how data mining, data compression rendering acceleration and other techniques are used to overcome the limitations of network transfer, computation capability and cache 
capacity   1. Introduction  Nucleation process is a highly pivotal phenomenon in many atmospheric and technological processes Understanding how particles or phases nucleate and grow in a multi-component mixture has significant practical influences from climate to micro-emulsions gas separations, and nano-materials. However, due to 
lacking effective data processing tools, the process of investigating atmospheric nucleation processes has been slow In paper [1 e des i gn ed and dev e l oped t h e w e bbased tool, CT-IANP\(Cyber Tool for Investigating Atmospheric Nucleation Processes\ facilitate data exploration. The tool mines the wealth of data generated from a particle-based nucleation simulation to visualize nucleation processes and search for 
patterns in the molecular self-organization of the clusters. Figure 1 describes the complete process from data generation to exploration. The web-based tool is deployed on the web server   
Figure 1  The complete process from data generation to exploration  The web clients can be classified into three 
categories based on the equipment they use: PC Personal Computer\nts, laptop Clients and Mobile clients. The Mobile clients include PDAs Personal Digital Assistant\ mobile phones, MIDs Mobile Internet Device\ome other embedded networking devices The web-based tool has excellent performance for PC clients and laptop Clients, shown as \223Web Client2\224 
and \223Web Client3\224 in Figure 1. However, when it comes to mobile clients, that is, \223Web Client 1\224 in Figure 1, the performance still needs to be improved due to their limited computing capability and slow network connection 978-1-4244-4996-5/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 


In this paper, we aim to improve the mobile user experience of CT-IANP. Our work focuses on the improvement for mobile clients who do not have a powerful graphics processing unit and high speed network connection. Worse still, they are mostly using a lower Clock Speed Central Processing Unit compared to the other two clients. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution that utilizes data mining, data compression, rendering acceleration and some other techniques  2. Background  2.1. Remote Visualization  In the past few years, several visualization algorithms    9  h a v e been propos ed to f acilitate  remote data analysis and promote remote collaborations. Various remote visualization strategies are used for interactive exploration of large data sets image-based rendering, parallel visualization severs and sub-sampling-clustering 6 7 8   Recently, many researchers have been investigating remote and distributed data analysis and visualization. Grid Initiative and projects such as the Globus Toolkit  prov i d ed t ool k i t s an d  infrastructure to deploy Grid computing systems Several visualization applications have been built using the service.  The impact of the Grid on visualization has been investigated by many researchers     2.2. Data Compression  To achieve higher interactivity, many existing remote visualization systems aim to reduce the amount of data transport by transforming raw data into an intermediate form of compact sizes 17   20 In  paper[1 d C a m p i n cl i n ed t o us e l o ssy  compression methods and mainly considered JPEG and two other compression methods, LZO and BZIP. On the contrary, [17 ten d to u s e lo ss-less co m p res s io n  techniques though the lossy compression has a higher compression rate. They thought the lossy compression can degrade the visual quality of final rendering significantly. Whether to use the lossy compression or lossless compression depends on the specific demand of the application. In this paper, a lossy compression method is adopted according to the properties associated with the data  2.3. Rendering Accelerating  3D visualization is a time-consuming work with large amount of matrix operations During past years, researchers mainly focused on the hardware based acceleration methods. Several techniques for polygon rendering are compared in Pascual’s n d K r u g e r. J. i n t r odu ced a n e w  GPU-accelerated volume rendering approach  For embedded devices with no special graphic hardware, 3D rendering is a tough work. Lamberti proposed a stream-based solution in his paper A  3D visualization system for mobile devices is described in Mosmondor’s paper [1  In our system, some simplifications are applied to raw data for faster rendering on embedded devices  3. System Overview Figure 2  Graphical user interface design  The figure 2 shows the overall user interface design of our tool. The 2D image on the left side shows the energy height information. The color at each pixel implies the strength of the energy, which is controlled by the colormap. On the right, molecule structures for all possible configurations are displayed. The details of the system can be found in   Figure 3  System schema  In this paper we enhance the system with three improvements as demonstrated in Figure 3. First, the raw data files are divided into small ones to avoid 


unnecessary data analyses. The molecule structure similarity is taken into consideration to facilitate the user interaction. Second, the data file is transformed into a visually lossless compression form to reduce the communication cost. Third, some mechanisms are applied to reduce the rendering cost and improve the interactivity. All these improvements will be discussed in detail in following sections  4. Data Mining  An interesting phenomenon can be seen from our observation of visualization process. The user doesn’t need all data in the configuration file. One configuration file is about 600M and it is impossible and unnecessary to display all the information on the screen. In fact, the client could be overwhelmed if too much information were given. The network load would be too heavy and the disk would be choked up with data. So it is important to identify the information the user actually needs. The following subsections will describe how we achieve this goal  4.1. Data File Division  When a user picks on a point on the energy height image, it is rational to assume that the user is only interested in the possible molecule structures on that position. That is, only a small fraction of the data need to be transmitted to the user and displayed on the screen Since the data is organized in order of the threedimensional coordinates, it is not difficult to find the data that is really needed. However, checking the whole file every time when the user asks for data still wastes a lot of time. Dividing the gigantic data file into small ones can solve the problem. Though it will cost a little bit more storage, it is obviously worthy The data file can be easily divided according to the coordinates. However, to facilitate the further work reorganized by similarity, the data file is divided into smaller ones. Each file only presents one molecule structure and all the files corresponding to the same coordinate are grouped in the same file folder  4.2. Reorganize by Similarity  Though data file division described in Section 4.1 has reduced communication and storage cost, the user will have to deal with more than 40 structures at the same time. A more efficient solution is needed Meanwhile, the researchers are interested in the similarity of the structures. It is a difficult and boring work to assort the structures manually. The similarity can be defined by Euclidean space distance. In another words, when the centroidal distance between two crystal nucleuses is no more than a pre-defined threshold, such as 2 units, in the coordinate system they are considered similar to each other. It can be defined by the formula below  1 n ikki k Gwan     If 12 2 GG  crystal nucleus 1 is considered similar to crystal nucleus 2 k a  is the position vector of the atom k in the crystal nucleus i; w k is the weight of the atom k, and n i is the amount of the atoms of the crystal nucleus  Figure 4  The display of the groups   Figure 5  The expand mode  With the similarity definition, the raw data representing similar structures can be gathered in the same group. The group becomes the smallest file folder. Only the first molecule structure in the group 


will be displayed on the screen and the others will be displayed in the expand mode. Figure 4 displays groups for our data. For example, when the user chooses a group, the first molecule structure will be on the webpage. Clicking the button “Expand” will change the page into Figure 5  4.3. Achievement and Deficiency  The data that need to be transported and stored is far less than the original one. Taking one configuration file as example, the size of the undivided file is 673.291MB. After two steps of selection, the related data are divided into smaller ones whose average size is 7KB. The number of groups for a random position is 7. In that sense, the data needed is about 49KB, which is more than 10 thousand times smaller than original one. The effect of data reduction is significant However, defining similarity with Euclidean space distance has ambiguous sometimes  Figure 6  An example showing the ambiguity  In Figure 6, the distance between A and B is 1.5 units and so is the distance between B and C. A, B and C are colinear. By definition, A is similar to B, B is similar to C, and A is not similar to C because the distance between them is 3. However according to the transitivity of similarity, A is similar to C. Two results are contradictory. The definition need to be modified For example, we may limit use of transitivity in our system  5. Data Compression  The data of energy height and structure coordinates are floating numbers. Considering the insufficiency of floating-point arithmetic operations for some embedded devices, converting the data into integer ones in a virtually lossless way is a good solution. It will also reduce the storage requirement. The compression algorithm is similar for all kinds of data Here we only focus on demonstrating the compression on the structure coordinate data. However, we will still discuss about the influence of data compression on other datasets in Section 5.2  5.1. Compression algorithm  In this section, the compression algorithm will be demonstrated step by step. The range of converted data is a symmetrical area around 0. The raw data of the coordinates are float numbers as table 1. The data in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 is consistent with the image in the next section  Table 1  Raw data  Raw data X y z 32.01348 28.05173 32.04031 18.02388 1.11762 48.03477 10.97445 25.02113 8.05043 25.01412 45.98017 2.01899 22.02443 43.01921 18.02546 11.01204 8.01563 36.03153   The data in Table 1 is converted with the following formulas     x xx y yy z zz     where 25.20613 24.57040 23.95484 xyz   The results  after data conversion are listed in table 2  Table 2  Intermediate data  intermediate data x’ y’ z 6.80735 3.48133 8.08547 7.18225 -23.45278 23.95484 14.23168 0.45073 -15.90441 0.19201 21.40977 -21.93585 3.18170 18.44881 -5.92938 14.19409 -16.55477 12.07669   The intermediate data is distributed in a range around 0. Since the largest absolute value of the data is less than 40, we can make a mapping transformation which turns the intermediate data into integer data between 20 and 20. Table 3 shows the data after conversion Table 3  Converted data  converted data x y z 5 2 6 5 -18 19 11 0 -12 0 17 -17 2 14 -4 11 -13 9  


 The range of the table can be adjusted in case two atoms are placed in same position Rendering with converted data is much faster than the raw data for as operation on integer numbers are more efficient than floating-point operations  5.2. Compression ratio and Outcomes  After compression, the size of the data file is cut down from 10,468B to 6,192B. In another word, the compression ratio is about 1.69:1. Though the compression ratio is not notable, the impact of avoiding floating-point calculations is obviously important to embedded system It has been our major concern that the image of energy height will have distorted colors and the 3D rendering of molecule structures will also be distorted From our experiments, most of time, the difference is unnoticeable and the rendering results are very close to the ones without compression. If you change the image and the structure into a big one, some small differences can be seen. Figure 7 demonstrates two energy height images and Figure 8 shows the 3D rendering results of two molecular structures. The left ones are results without data compression while the right ones are the ones using compressed data   Figure 7  The comparison of the original image \(Left and the compressed image\(Right    Figure 8  The comparison of original model\(Left and the compressed model\(Right  6. Rendering Acceleration  Rendering original data files can be a heavy burden for many embedded devices. The problem was caused not only by the computing capability but also by the size of cache. We solve the problem in following ways Most people take a ball as the appearance of an atom without any doubt about that. In fact this opinion has been proved yet. Furthermore, when the device can not support the user interactivity with perfect ball model face reduction is an efficient compromise. If the model is displayed in a small screen like mobile phone, even an icosahedrons looks like a ball An experiment is made on an intelligence mobile phone Blackberry 8700G. With the original rendering method, only 4 pictures per minute can be displayed That is when user tries to rotate the model, only discontinuous pictures are displayed. When the icosahedrons are adopted, it displays 20 pictures per minute while the atoms look very similar as shown in Figure 9   Figure 9  The comparison of using different precisions: The left pict ure shows the rendering result using face reduction and the right one shows rendering results wi thout face reduction  Different configurations can be chosen in the option panel according to the device configuration Although face reduction is more focused on the limitations of the computing capability, it also has effects on other limits of the embedded device. With proposed solution, the rendering of large data files become affordable to most embedded device  7. Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper, we introduce the improvements made for the mobile users who want to experience the webbased tool, CT-IANP. It demonstrates that visualization can be well applied to mobile devices In the future, more researches are needed in rendering algorithms and other related technologies Considering the size of the data, more data analysis functionalities supported by data mining technologies are worthy for further exploration Furthermore, we expect that this paper will be a trigger for further related researches

  7  Figure 4 compares drive time blue line\ run time \(red line\for K10 Red.  On June 9, drive time and run time are nearly equal, indicating that the robot was driving during most of the duty period as expected.  On June 10 and 11 however, the drive time is significantly less than the run time, indicating that the robot was stationary roughly half the time it was running.  This mismatch can indicate performance problems, either due to increased robot down time or robot wait time between plans.  An inspection of events during these days indicates the robot did experience problems on both days.  On June 10, communication difficulties and low lighting resulted in reduced rover performance.  The wait time between plans was between 30 and 50 minutes, which is much longer than on June 9.  On June 11 the rover base controller had problems and the site terrain impacted traversability, both of which impacted the rover's ability to complete plans in a timely manner Figure 5 compares distance trav eled by the K10 Red rover to the planned distance.  An inspection of this figure indicates a limitation in using accumulated total distance as a metric.  By the end of the test, K10 Red had traveled 2375 meters, which agrees well with the planned distance of 2235 meters.  A comparison of planned distance to distance traveled for each duty cycle, how ever, reveals that the rover traveled further than planned on June 9, which masked the fact that the rover traveled less than planned on June 10  Figure 5. K10 Red Distance at Moses Lake There were significant problems with the quality of data communication to JSC for remote science operations on June 10 and 11, indicated by the high data gap count on these days. On June 10, there were 54 gaps ranging from 10 seconds to 53.5 minutes and on June 11 there were 65 gaps ranging form 10 seconds to 54 minutes. The reduced data quality affected the accuracy of the performance metrics computed remotely for K10 Red on these days K10 Black Performance K10 Black performed systematic site surveys in support of simulated science operations on June 12. A typical site survey performed by K10 Black consisted of navigating through a sequence of waypoints while taking GPR readings continuously. Often microscopic images were taken at waypoints as well. During the day of survey operations at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, the K10 Black robot was powered up for 5.67 hrs \(Run Time\and drove for .64 hrs \(Drive Time\or 11.3% of the time it was powered up Figure 6\Drive Time was lower than expected due a combination of GPR hardware problems and navigation problems due to inaccurate odometry in the sand at the survey site. K10 Black attempted to execute four science plans for a total planned distance of 776 meters \(Planned Distance\ actually traveled a total of 838 meters Completed Distance\ perform these survey activities Figure 7  Figure 6. K10 Black Operating Time at Moses Lake  Figure 7. K10 Black Distance at Moses Lake 


  8 The quality of data communication to JSC for remote science operations on June 12 was much better than that on the two days prior. There were a total of 5 gaps, ranging from 10 seconds to 30.75 minutes. These data gaps did not have a significant effect on th e accuracy of the performance metrics computed remotely for K10 Black 5  D ISCUSSION  The Role of Context Understanding the intent of rover activities provides an important basis for grounding the computation and interpretation of performance metrics. In particular, we assert that metrics, whether us ed for real-time monitoring or post-processed analysis, can only be interpreted in context  i.e., with respect to expect ations of performance for a particular task, activity plan, robot mode of operation, etc For example, the computation of Percentage Distance Complete \(ratio of Completed Distance to Planned Distance\requires constraining the computation of Completed Distance to be performed only while K10\222s plan is executing and to be reset to zero when a new plan is uplinked. Similarly the computation of metrics during autonomous operations should be distinguishable from metrics during teleoperation because expected performance can be quite different in these different control modes Finally, the computation of metrics during anomalous operations should be separa ble from nominal operations The rover may be successful at recovering from a problem while doing less well at achieving nominal mission objectives. In some cases, a me tric needs to be computed concurrently in more than one context For example, it is useful to accumulate Comple ted Distance for each plan distance traveled within a pl an\entire mission \(total distance traveled Another example is that the accuracy of real-time performance computations de pends upon the quality of the communication with the robot. We used the Data Gap Count as an indicator of communication quality during the field test at Moses Lake. While useful, this count does not represent information about the duration of communication problems. Based on our experience at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we have identified a new metric for communication quality. We propose to compute the percentage of the duty period without data from the robot \(called Percentage Time in Data Gap\ as a measure of the quality of metrics, since a high percentage would indicate lossy communication and reduced confidence in the com puted values of performance metrics Real-time Displays During the test we identified and implemented a number of new features for the dashboard displays in response to operational needs. These feature include \(1\a user-initiated snapshot of all computed values we later expect to add the ability to restore the state of the computation engine to this checkpoint state, \(2\ogging of time-stamped user comments \(called user events pect to display user events in the timeline disp lay, and \(3\o the value of constants in the dashboard displays without restarting the computations. We also added new dashboard displays of rover data during the test. These displays provide information about the rover that aids in understanding performance \(i.e., execution status of planned tasks, robot subsystem status\add these new displays indicates the flexibility and extensibility of our architecture for performance monitoring Duty Periods During the HRS field test at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we computed metrics whenever data were being transmitted from the rover. We did this to ensure that metrics reflected all rover activities. We expected that the value of metrics at the end of each day would then provide a summary of the day\222s activities. This resulted, however, in the computation of metrics during time periods when the rover was not intended to be operating \(e.g lunch periods, waiting for a demo, etc\e-based metrics such as Run Time and Drive Time were computed at times when the rover was not intended to be powered up or moving. This resulted in inflated Run Times \(see Figures 4 and 7\and artificially reduced the ratio of Drive Time to Run Time We believe a more realistic assessment of performance should constrain the computation of metrics to time periods when the rover is intended to be performing tasks. We define a concept called a duty period that corresponds to a contiguous interval of operations \(such as from rover startup in the morning until a planned ground control break period\We propose to compute accumulated metrics only during duty periods in future tests Technology Deployment at NASA The evaluation of our performance monitoring software during robotic field tests has provided useful feedback on the utility of the proposed metric s.  In particular we have gained valuable experience in using such metrics when data are subject to periodic dropouts We recently evaluated the use of our performance metrics during an analog test of rover reconnaissance as a precursor to planning astronaut EVAs where we got feedback a bout the utility of metrics for flight operations.  There is remaining work, however, before this technology can be operationally deployed A variety of data types are used by the real-time performance monitoring of robots.  These data types have correlates in current NASA operations, including spacecraft telemetry, Comps \(combinations of raw telemetry\anning information, and flight rules.  Deployment of performance 


  9 monitoring technology in flight operations will require that such information be captured electronically and made available for computer-based reasoning.  Recent efforts to move flight products like Sp ace Station activity plans and attitude timelines into XML supports this objective and future programs are investigating standards for representing such information, but current NASA programs have not yet achieved the level of information integration that will be needed to automate performan ce monitoring as described in this paper The availability of real-time performance data raises the possibility of using this data to adjust operations for improved performance.  Such real-time performance management has become a consideration for commercial plant operations as plant automation is introduced.  Often the barriers to real-time performance management are as much cultural as technical In a recent article \(Spiegel 2007\t was observed the adjustment of plant operations by the enterprise has met strong resistance due to mutual mistrust between plant operators and corporate Information Technology departments.  Such barriers are also a possibility when introduci ng real-time performance management into NASA operations 6  F UTURE W ORK  Assessing Performance Based on Expectations An important result from this test is an approach for improving the interpretation of performance metrics. Prior to the test, we established performance expectations from robot task plans \(called plan performance\Satisfactory performance was defined as the achievement of planned targets \(e.g., successful completion of planned tasks or collection of planned samples\ion of robot performance during the test made it clear there are other considerations in defining satisfactory performance The limits imposed by robotic hardware and software design define expectations about the robot\222s engineered performance. Engineered performance defines robot capabilities under ideal circum stances. Robot operations however, often occur under less than ideal circumstances which can constrain maximum speed and sensor accuracy The limits imposed by the environment in which the robot operates define expectati ons about robot operational performance. Engineered perform ance also can be degraded over the course of multiple missions due to normal component wear as well as systemic problems that reduce performance The limits imposed by component use and subsystem problems define the expectations about robot degraded mode performance. Robot operations can be further constrained by flight rules. Maximum robot speeds may be reduced when operating near other robots. Or, certain robot behaviors may be precluded when operating near humans The limits imposed by the flight rules established for a mission define expectations about safe performance Moreover, when comparing robot metrics over multiple duties periods or missions \(called historical performance\or comparing the performance of different robots, it is important to establish a basis of comparison that identifies which of these performance dimensions predominate and how these dimensions combine to establish performance expectations, such as: Did robotic hardware or software change between missions? And were the robots being compared operating under the similar operational constraints Summarizing Performance We are currently preparing to use our real-time performance monitoring software to support a test of science operations at NASA Ames Research Center in November 2008. Based on our experience at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we have identified a few key metrics that should provide a high-level summary of rover performance. These metrics will be displayed on a summary Web page for operational use. We will summarize rover performance from the following three perspectives 200  Mission: metrics that describe the rover\222s contribution to the mission. The Work Efficiency shows the ratio of rover productive time to rover overhead time. When WEI exceeds 1.0, the rover is spending more time accomplishing mission objectives than performing other activities. The Percentage of Time on Task shows the ratio of rover productive time to total operating time 200  Science: metrics that describe the rover\222s performance with respect to the scie nce plan. The Percentage Distance Complete summarizes the percentage of the planned distance that has been traveled by the rover The Percentage of Tasks Complete describes the percentage of planned tasks successfully completed 200  Rover: metrics that describe the rover\222s health and status. We detect when personnel intervene in rover operations to handle anomalies, and we compute the Mean Time to Intervene a nd the Mean Time between Interventions We also plan to compute the Percentage Time in Data Gap as a measure of the quality of computed values, since a high percentage indicates lossy communication and a lower confidence in metrics To illustrate how we expect this information to summarize performance for mission managers, consider the following example based on data collected by K10 Red at Moses Lake on the afternoon of June 11, 2008. In this example, we 


  10 played back recorded data into our performance monitoring software and took a screen shot of the Ops Synopsis dashboard display partway through the run \(Figure 8 this situation, the rover is executing a science plan to perform reconnaissance of the Moses Lake Sand Dunes. At the time of the screen shot, the rover has spent 59% of its time on planned tasks for a WEI of 1.446. This indicates the mission is going reasonably well, since WEI is greater than 1.0 and the rover is spending the majority of its time on planned tasks. The science metrics indicate good progress is being made on data collection, requiring the rover to drive 326 meters to complete 70% of the plan. The rover metrics indicate minimal unintended human intervention, with MTBI \(00:39:10.7\gnificantly greater than MTTI 00:02:01.2\The Percentage Time in Data Gap is zero indicating that metrics are based on all available robot data and are thus considered reliable  Figure 8. Example of Summary Metrics for Mission Manager  7  C ONCLUSIONS  Our performance computation so ftware operated reliably for over 46 hours during a four-day period. Task performance metrics computed for the K10 robots during the field test include robot drive time, robot run time, and performance during plans \(e.g., percentage of planned distance completed, percentage of planned samples complete\We measured the number of times we lost signal from the robot at the simulated Mission Control as a measure of the quality of our real-time metrics. Based on these results, we conclude that our proposed approach for computing and displaying rover performance metrics in real-time is viable 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was funded under NASA\222s Small Business Innovative Research \(SBIR\ program, Topic X7.02 HumanSystem Interaction and supported by the NASA Exploration Systems Technology Development Program \(ETDP Human-Robotic Systems \(HRS\.

Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
