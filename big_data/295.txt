Abstract As our early work we proposed a data mining model for query refinement using Association Rules ARs mined among keywords of a large document database In this pa per first we explicitly identify principles of a data mining model for query refinement and show that our model satis fies the principles Second, we propose a mechanism to re duce the large number ofARs using a concept called \224prime keyword\224 The effectiveness of our approach will be dis cussed Considering the fact 
that most of today\222s searching engines on the Internet are keyword based our approach can be easily extended to support Web applications 1 Introduction Due to the rapid growth of on-line documents the dif ficulty users are facing is that a large number of irrelevant documents will be returned when a query is under-specified or contains ambiguous keywords However the task of for mulating an effective query is difficult in the sense that it requires users without any knowledge about the collection of documents 
to predict the keywords that will appear in the documents the users want to retrieve Therefore it is highly desirable that a system can provide some mechanisms to help users to refine their queries Most of today\222s searching engines on the Internet are keyword based Some of them allow users to refine their queries using additional keyword\(s However the issue we argue in this paper is how likely a user can choose a set of proper keywords If a user knows what keywords are good Nobuo Ohbo Institute of Electronics  
Information Sciences University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba Japan 305 ohbo is tsukuba.ac.jp for refinement hekhe would possibly use them in hisher original query It is uneasy to refine queries without any knowledge about the set of documents A possible solution is to use categories to categorize all documents However the categorization itself is a difficult task to systematically categorize a huge number of growing documents As our early work in LCYO98 LCN0991 we proposed to pro vide users 
with a candidate list of keywords in order to help users to refine their queries step-by-step The candidate list is systematically constructed using association rule AR mining techniques ARs are based on a statistical method in which the support makes rules meet certain frequency and the confidence describes degree of relation The confidence also indicates that relationships are not symmetric as con fidences of X  Y and Y  X are often different from each 
other It is very important that unlike the similarity and co-occurrence ARs are not symmetric As related work query expansion Peat911 and query feedback Salt901 were proposed to make use of relation ships such as similarity between keywords In brief the technique of query expansion is based on an association hypothesis which states if an index term is good at dis criminating relevant from non-relevant documents then any closely associated index term is also likely to be good at this On the other hand, the relevance 
feedback in Salt901 is a method in which queries are modified using the key words obtained from the result set of documents if they have high similarity to the keywords used in the queries However these approaches have the difficulties to differ entiate between relevant and non-relevant documents be cause the keywords with higher similarities intend to in clude the similar documents LChen971 and IVde971 in dependently noticed the problem that too many documents 0-7695-1393-UO2 17.00 0 2002 IEEE 245 


will be retrieved by a query which is under-specified or con tains ambiguous terms The solution proposed in Vde97 is an algorithm called RMAP which provides suggestions to refine the user query by calculating ranks of terms How ever RMAP provides one-step refinement In contrary we provide systematic stepwise query refinement Our system reduces the number of candidates that a user need choose to refine hisher query and guarantees no lost of docu ments helshe wants to access Like the methods proposed in Salt90 Peat911 our approach is based on co-occurrence of keywords Unlike these approaches, we use ARs, and we focus on screening retrieval results In addition different from the work [Peat91 Salt901 which automatically refines a user query our interactive interface enhances the precision because the user interactively chooses what hdshe needs to refine queries The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 gives an overview The preliminaries of this study is given in Section 3 Section 4 introduces our early work Sec tion 5 identifies five principles of a data mining model for query refinement The main contribution of this paper is discussed in Section 6 in which we introduce a new con cept called \223prime keyword\224, and describe how to use prime keywords to significantly reduce keyword candidates. Sec tion 7 concludes our discussion 2 Anoverview The overview of our query refinement approach is illus trated in Figure 1 First the keywords will be extracted from a document database ARs are mined for keywords and are stored and managed in a rule base Second, from the rule base the system selects ARs with respect to the user\222s query For an AR Q  R Q is a set of keywords in the query to be refined, and R is a set of keywords for refinement We call R as refinement candidate All re finement candidates will be displayed including statistical information such as support and conjidence which indicate the screening effect Third a user interactively selects a re finement candidate, based on the statistics information to refine hisher query This process will be carried out repeat edly until the user satisfies the results of the query Figure 2 illustrates an example of query refinement To make the figure simple each node shows only the differ ence from its parent node In other words each node in fact contains all the keywords of its ancestor nodes In this ex ample, suppose that a user issues a query by keyword 223Pic ture communication\224 The system shows that there are 784 hits for the query, and further provides both refinement can didates and the number of document hits The user query is then refined by adding any of the candidates to the orig inal query Suppose that the user chooses 223Picture com pression\224 Then by adding this keyword the number of hit documents will be reduced to 177 In the same way if the user adds 223Picture quality\224 further to the query the final query becomes Picture communication Picture compres sion, Picture quality and 38 documents will be returned This means that any of the 38 documents contain all these three keywords In Figure 2 the dot line arrows show some other possible ways of query refinement 3 Preliminaries In this section in brief we give the notations that will be used in the following discussions Let D and lK be a set of documents and a set of keywords respectively An operation p which extracts keywords from a docu ment d E D is defined as p\(d  IC I IC E K A IC is a keyword included in d Furthermore let D c D UdED p\(d is denoted by p\(D and in particular p\(D  K A query is a set of keywords Q C K A query evaluation retrieving all the documents that contain all the given key words in Q is defined as o\(Q  d  d E D A Q p\(d Let X and Y be subsets of I The support and the confi dence of a rule X  Y are calculated as Spt\(X 3 Y  Io\(X U Y and Cnf\(X  Y  In\(X U Y X respectively In addition to the minimal support as used in Fayy96 Han95, Sava95 Srik961 we defined the maximum support and the maximum confidence for the purposes of query re finement and call it a base condition as follows An AR X 3 Y satisfies a base condition if and only if Os  Spt\(X  Y  Os and Cnf\(X  Y  e Here Os Os and Oc are minimum support maximum support and maximum confidence of the rule respectively Thresh olds 6\222s affect the refinement hence must be chosen care fully Our principles proposed in section 5 will be good heuristics in making the choice 4 Early Work Stepwise Refinement A stepwise refinement is to refine a query step-by-step In each single step a keyword is added In this section we introduce two essential concepts stem rules and coverage which form the fundamentals of stepwise refinement Stem rules are the only rules that we need to store in the rule base All the other applicable ARs can be generated from the stem rules at run time The idea behind the stem rules is to significantly reduce the number of candidates stored in the rule base Consequently as a trade-off a few addition steps of refinement might be needed For example suppose a user issues a query with a keyword which has 100 co occurrence keywords If the user refines hisher query by adding one keyword at one step, there are at most 100 steps and at each step one of the 100 keywords can be selected 246

In this example if the keyword 223Coding standards\224 does not appear in the candidate list then however {\223Picture commu nication\224 223Picture compression\224 be further refined docu ment 223docl\224 can never be retrieved To guarantee that the system does not cut off any part of the results that should be retrieved from the original query the concept of 223coverage\224 was introduced The general def inition of coverage is as the follows given in LCN099 Definition 2 Coverage Let K\(C 2\223 be a powerset of W and D\(C D a set of documents If DE U a QEK then we say that IC covers D or K is a coverage of D In a similar fashion K is also called a coverage of K\221 2 2w iff By the definition 2K is a coverage of D and 2P\(D is a coverage of D We also say a set of rules R covers D if X U Y I X  Y E R covers D Naturally coverage IC of D is a minimum coverage if and only if D can not be covered by any pure subset of K Minimum coverage is defined in order to exclude redundant keywords from the rule space Especially union of all the sets in a minimum coverage of D is called prime keywords Based on prime keywords in Section 6 we will discuss prime graph and transfer graph and develop constructing algorithms The algorithm of generating minimum coverages LCN099 as well as the algorithm of generating stem rules will be inte grated 5 Five Principles In this section, we identify five principles of our mining based query refinement approach 0 pl Screening effect The first issue is about screen ing effect In Agra93 Fayy96 Han95 Sava95 Srik961 ARs are defined as ones whose support and confidence exceed given thresholds called a minimum support and a minimum confidence Given a query containing a set of keywords Q When an AR Q  Y is picked up the keywords included in Y will be added to a submitted query Q However if the AR has a high confidence then the effectiveness of screening the documents being retrieved is very small To ad dress this issue maximum support and maximum con fidence are proposed to be used in conjunction with minimum support and minimum confidence p2 Appropriate number of refinement candidates One extreme example is the number of refinement candidates should never exceed the number of hits of the original query If the number of keywords in a doc ument database is t then a naive method must check t x t  1 combinations to generate all ARs between two keywords and so on Finally it must check expo nential combinations for generating all ARs To avoid a large number of rules being generated a technique called stepwise re$nement is adopted based on stem rules\([LCY098 by which the other ARs can be de rived p3 No oversight of documents \(coverage Unlike other approaches, we believe that it is hard for a sys tem to predict what users want Therefore in our inter active refinement refinement candidates are carefully chosen By displaying inappropriate refinement candi dates some of the documents can never be retrieved A co-related concept, called coverage was proposed in our early work LCN099 A set of keywords is said to be a coverage of a set of documents if these documents can be retrieved using the same set of key words With the concept of stem rules and coverage the number of ARs can be reduced and it can ensure that all documents can be covered p4 Uniform screening This means that all refine ment candidates have similar screening effect to the original query Otherwise some candidates have small screening effect hence are not proper to be candidates Indeed this principle is implied by pl and p3 sim ilarly pl is implied by p3 and p4 under certain con ditions However, the main condition is that the set of keywords is not large Otherwise the stem rule and coverage are not enough to even guarantee pl To ad dress this, a new concept prime keyword is introduced in this paper and will be discussed later The prime keywords are such keywords that any documents can be retrieved from some of them p5 Appropriate number of steps of refining Nat urally no user wants to spend too much time in the process of refinement Instead he/she will prefer to get to an appropriate size quickly. Again when a doc ument database is large the retrieval result becomes larger and accordingly the number of keywords be comes large too Therefore the co-occurrence be tween keywords becomes much more frequent then it takes more steps to screening the retrieval result All the five principles are important in that they are users\222s natural requirements We also find that they are not independent from each other under certain conditions Our 248 


early work only addressed p2 and p3 for not very large doc ument databases We add pl and show that the first three principles are the basis and the last two can be derived from the first three Note p2 can be considered as a tradeoff with pl We explain how p4 and p5 are derived from the first three below First the principle p4 of uniform screening means that if kl and k2 are the refinement candidates of kO then la\({kO kl is about la\({kO k2 We show that p4 is implied by pl and p3 By P3 Ifl\({lco kl  la\({kO k2 o\(\(kO  then o\(\(kO,k2   la\({kO kl implies that Ia\({kO kl  is almost Ic\({kO which means that the screening effect of kl is 223bad\224 hence contradicts pl Second p5 is satisfied if pl through p3 are well satis fied Because of p2 and p4 after n steps of refinement the number of documents retrieved by the refined query Q\222 will be approximately la\(Q\222  Ia where C is the average number of refinement candidates. For instance let Io of refinement la\(&\222 about 10 The user can be comfortable with the retrieval by Q\222 rather than to further refine it In our system several concepts are introduced for sat isfying the principles mentioned above In particular the coverage mainly guarantees p3 the stepwise helps to re duce refinement candidates and prime keywords help to re duce candidates significantly in large document databases with a large number of keywords It is worthwhile noting that a concept does not correspond one single principle In stead as shown in p4 and p5 they work together Further more, without prime keywords, coverage and stepwise can become powerless for large document databases 6 Refinement Model Using Prime Keywords In this section we discuss the detail of \223prime keyword\224 The approach of using both stem rule and coverage in our early work is efficient However when the document database gets large and the number of keywords grows the number of rules becomes large This not only requires more storage space and maintenance but also longer response time during the query refinement To address this problem we propose a new concept called prime keywords Definition 3 prime keyword Let D and K be the set of all documents and all keywords respectively R is called the prime key words ofD or K i#{{k I IC E E is a minimum cover of D or 2\224 By the definition of coverage prime keywords satisfy the following expression D  U a\({k 3 U a\(K kEg KCW In other words any documents can be retrieved from a cer tain subset of the prime keywords Therefore if all users formulate their query using only keywords of prime key words then it will be very effective and efficient to build a refinement supporting system based on prime keywords We construct a prime graph to treat queries containing only prime keywords However it is difficult to require users to remember these prime keywords and non-prime keywords Our solution is to map a non-prime keywords query to a prime graph by searching their coverage from prime key words and construct a transfer graph Before giving the formal description we will explain these notations by the following example Table 1 gives an example of a document database In this example, each line of the table describes a document with the keywords contained in it D  di};\222 K  ki};\222 and one example of prime keywords of I is  IC because it satisfies UkEg a\({k  D Note that prime keyword is not unique Keywords in d\(C K Dl Table 1 A document database example The prime graph based on prime keywords  ki is given in the left part of Figure 3 where DK means search ing the documents contains no other keywords than those in K As an instance if the user\222s query is Q  kl then as shown in the figure, the user ca_n choose adding k2 or k3 to refine Q Another choice is D{kl which means he/she terminates the refinement and retrieve the documents containing exactly the keyword kl For non-prime key words K  E the transfer graph is constructed as shown in the right part of Figure 3 The transfer graph has only two levels Each node in the first level is a non-prime key word and its children nodes which are all prime keywords form one of its minimum coverage 249

Finally the remaining prime keywords subset of Q3 k4 Q3  k7 klO is identified The result must be a node of a prime graph The soundness is guaranteed as has been discussed in the properties above 7 Conclusion We consider all possible requirements in query refine ment and formally identify them by five principles A I  I to 20 30 U 50 M 70 en 90 03 Figure 5 Sizes of prime keywords model of supporting IR query refinement based on prime keywords is proposed and is confirmed to be sufficient in the sense that it satisfies the principles We built a protocol system and used the JICST docu ment database for testing which contains 120,000 docu ments About 22,000 keywords are extracted Figure 5 shows the effectiveness of the center support and fixed or re-counted support for Algorithm 1 The center support of around 80 with re-counted support gives a reasonable set of prime keywords of size 2,829 that is one eighth of the number of all keywords Table 2 shows the number of the co-occurrences of keywords with support greater than or equal to 10 The numbers give upper-bound of the sizes of the two graphs \(prime graph and transfer graph\and confirm the effectiveness of our approach As an instance the number of co-occurrences of 2-keywords for prime key words is 9,061 while the number is 60,048 for all key words The size of prime graph will never exceed the total number of 12,718 which is less than one tenth of that of all keywords This means that our approach can efficiently support query refinement More importantly, there is a few co-occurrence among more than 4 keywords which implies that, with prime graph, the process of refinement will finish in 2 or 3 steps and hence satisfies p5 As for the retrieval quality we ensure the same results obtained in our early work LCYO98 LCN099 and therefore omit the testing results in this paper Interactive refinement enables users to enhance precise while keeping high recall As future work we will investigate the sizes of rules and the effectiveness of these rules for precision We are plan ning to use clustering as a technique for query refinement in conjunction with association rules Also, we are extend ing our work to support query refinement in a distributed environment as well to cope with dynamical increment of documents 252

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
