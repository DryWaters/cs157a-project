Four letters that represents - Four words that are comprised of even more letters \(Model Based, Systems, Engineering\ - which is represented as an acronym For us to understand what M-B-S-E is, someone had to define letters; arrange those letters into words; provide definitions for those words; combine the words together to provide a specific meaning; and finally, define the term acronym and how it is applied So, what is Mfano Mifumo ya Uhandisi ya Msingi MMUM\??? The words Model Based Systems Engineering

A P r oces s bas e d Data A r c h itect u r e prov ides an  understanding of what information is needed to effectively execute the enterprise's business processes and provides a framework for effectively managing the enterprise's information environment.   It provides a representation of data artifacts and data assets that classifies and defines required data entities, their attributes, and associations to facilitate knowledge of how data is produced, managed, and shared in different contexts of use.  The Data Architecture provides identification, management, interoperability, and integration of information across business or organizational elements needed to support Product Data Life-cycle Management \(PDLM\oals.  It also ensures data needed by 
programs and projects \(e.g., for milestones, reviews mission operations, and anomalies or investigations decisions, and outcomes\tified and managed to provide traceability of data used in decision making.  In the past, the primary methodology for accomplishing this process has been highly Document-centric.  However, as systems get more complex and the amount of \223Big Data\224 expands, conventional methodologies induce undo risk and are unable to provide the highest fidelity of data necessary to make the best decisions

  3 5  T EN S TEP MBSE  D EVELOPMENT P ROCESS  1- Process/Business Architecture Definition The foundation to any Model Based Systems Engineering development is a well-defined and understood set of Business Rules/Processes.  These processes provide the guidelines and road maps for implementing the model based approach.  The good news is these processes should already be well established if you are currently using a Document Based Systems Engineering \(DBSE\methodology.  MBSE does not change the underlying defined and approved standard operating procedures \(SOPs\d processes.  What is changing is the methodology for implementing these processes.  Therefore, in many cases, this step of the process has already been completed The position of the system-of-interest within the hierarchy of the overall architecture will determine the specific guiding Business Architecture rules for Systems Engineering and Project Management process requirements The Program/Project could adopt established Corporate standards, tailored Corporate standards, tailored Program/Project standards, or decide to create new standards and processes, which meet or exceed the parent standard\(s\or Programs/Projects these documents would typically be included as A pplicable Documents in the Systems Engineering Management Plan \(SEMP  2- Data Architecture Framework Definition Just as the Process Architecture definition may have previously been defined, many elements and viewpoints [1  of the Data Architecture may have already been defined from a Document standpoint.  These Data Architecture elements are easily extractable from document based forms templates, excel spreadsheets, etc.  The main effort in this step is to extract the data objects, attributes and association to other data objects contained within the document based forms and templates.  The next step is to ensure the document based artifacts map to and meet the intent of the Business Rules/Processes.  In many cases document based systems can mask process deficiencies due to the vast amounts of disparate or redundant data spread across multiple documents.  Additionally, data extracted from documents, rather than derived from the defined process must be normalized.  Normalization is the process of interrogating the Data Architecture and reducing or eliminating redundancies and dependencies.  Process based data architectures should not require normalization, unless of course the process is redundant or duplicative.  In this case the process itself might require normalization Based on the Program/Project Business Architecture definition, a Data Architecture \223Framework\224 \(DAF\n be adopted, tailored or newly developed.  The Data Architecture \223Framework\224 identifies the Data Objects attributes, and associations \(relationships, links correspondence, etc.\rogram/Project Existing DAFs can be tailored and expanded to add optional Program/Project specific attributes and/or associations Deviations/tailoring to the common Data Architecture model should be documented and well understood so the data can evidentially be transformed for data exchange integrated reports, audits, and/or metrics.  Unique program/project specific additions should also be documented in the Program/Project\222s Data Architecture Dictionary.  The resulting DAF should be documented or referenced in the Systems Engineering Management Plan SEMP Data Architecture Data Object examples include Mission Needs, Goals, Objectives \(NGOs\edule, Work Breakdown Structures \(WBS\ost/Budget Breakdown Structures \(CBS\anizational \(people, boards, panels Breakdown Structures \(OBS\equirements, Functions Operations, Risks, Analysis, Capabilities, Validation Architectures, Products, etc.  Domain specific subsystem areas such as software, power, thermal/cooling, structures and mechanisms, data systems, etc. are instantiations of the Architecture/Product Objects See example Figure 2 \226 Sample Data Object Diagram Figure 2 - Sample Data Object Diagram

The identifica t Attributes should be directly related to th e data object and NOT the integrated report v times Data Architectures and Data Object a are developed based on the contents of a This practice causes data redund dependencies and implementations.

  5 information to ensure adhe rence to the processes and procedures and to measure the maturity level of the program/project as it moves through it\222s life-cycle phases These data quality audits will be used when implementing your MBSE approach and help identify discrepancies as they occur per the defined measurements.  Examples of audits include: Requirements with only one shall in the requirement statement, avoids compound requirements Requirements with only one parent, helps identify duplicate requirements and potential traceability errors; Requirements that are more mature than their parent Requirement In a typical Document Based system the development of many of these data structures are stove-piped, with minimal consideration to related Data Objects.  At best there are cross-reference matrices hidden away in appendices, which are rarely validated when a document is released  3- Application Architecture Identify authoritative data repository application for Data Objects.  Applications MUST be able to \223expose\224 data to other applications for data integration and interrogation These applications are typically server-based, not desktop instances.  Applications are typically related to a specific Systems Engineering or Program Management function \(i.e Requirements Management, Risk Management, Schedule Management, Budget Management, etc There are several broad spectrum applications that are on the market that can satisfy multiple functions, making data integration a less burdensome task.  For smaller programs/projects this approach is preferred to limit the overhead of developing complex Information Technology Systems to integrate the disparate data  4- Data Object to Application Assignment The identified Data Objects, from the Data Architecture 223Framework\224, necessary to perform the Project Management and Systems Engineering functions, per the Business Architecture, should be assigned to their authoritative repository \(application\.  Typically authoritative data objects and attributes reside in only one application.  The defined Data Objects are mapped to their respective application until all data objects have been assigned to at least one application.  If data objects are assigned to multiple applications, then the authoritative source application must be identified.  This practice will help to avoid stale, out of sync duplicative \(reflective that will evidentially require the laborious task of normalizing and reconciliation  5- Application Schema Development Each application needs to incorporate the assigned subset of the Data Architecture \223Framework\224 based on the assignment of Data Objects to Authoritative Applications The Program/Project can take liberties with the Data Object names and attribute labels; however the underlining definition must be maintained to ensure data integration An XML, OWL, or other common format schema for the Data Architecture Framework can be tailored and parsed based on Program and application specifications and used to establish the traceability to the Data Architecture Framework and established processes  6- Application Methodology Development A Methodology, how you implement the process, should be developed and documented for data objects, internal associations and attributes for the assigned application Each application will include it\222s own quirks and limitations related to establishing the methodology for capturing the necessary data.  In theory, there should not be duplications of implementations or multiple ways of capturing the same data.  This methodology needs to be governed to ensure the application\222s model artifacts are consistent, which can be accomplished in part by implementing the defined data audits  7- Disparate Data Objects Identification An analysis of the Application Architecture and their assigned Data Objects will result in the level of data disparity within the program/project.  The Program/Project should document anywhere there is an association between two data objects that were assigned to different authoritative applications. Ideally a Program or Project would try to minimize the amount of disparate data objects to reduce the risk of reporting erroneous or stale information.  For example, if Requirements are in a Requirements Management application and Risks are in a Risk Management Application, there would need to be some way to associate the Risks \223caused by\224 \(uni-directional semantic example\Requirement.  You want to avoid putting the Requirements in the Risk Application and the Risk in the Requirements application as an integration solution if at all possible  8- Data Integration Framework Definition The purpose of the Data Integration Framework \(DIF\s to perform as the middle-ware, which joins the disparate data object\222s assigned authoritative applications to maintain the structure of the data model.  The DIF is the back-end Application-to-Application interface.  The front-end of the DIF provides a user interface to record the associations \(or link repository\ss data objects/applications and to generate user defined reports and analysis.   The Data Integration Framework should comply with the previously defined Data Architecture Framework to develop a Common Model.  This common model will facilitate the transformation of data from Application-to-Application and generating reports  The Common Model Data Architecture Framework provides the target environment for the source\(s\ from the application\(s\The source application schema maps to the 


  6 common model schema based on the pre-defined Data Object attributes.  This practice allows the source applications to change over time, but maintains the integrity of the common data model.  If an application changes the only thing that should need to change is the mapping between the target and source architectures  There are many different data mapping software applications that can help maintain the relationships between the source\(s\ and the target  9- Technology Architecture Development   The Technology Architecture includes the Information Technology \(IT\frastructure, which includes the Data Integration Framework \(DIF\o be successful the Technology Architecture must have real-time or near realtime access to the exposed application data items  10- Define the System of Interest Architecture After the Business, Data, Application, and Technology Architectures have been defined \(or sufficiently defined to begin a subset, just in time need of the SE Process\ the Model-Based Project Management and Systems Engineering efforts can begin for the System-of-Interest Architecture.  It is important for the System-of-interest to be modeled per the described data architecture and application methodologies. Inter-application data items should be registered in the Data Integration Framework to extend the data model from one application to the other application\(s within the Technology Architecture.  A tool agnostic SE Process Overview example is included in Section 7  6  T RANSITIONING FROM DBSE Transitioning an organization from a Document-Based Systems Engineering \(DBSE\ethodology Implementation of the SE process using distributed documents, often duplicating data\o a Model/Data-centric Implementation using authoritative, distributed, cohesive tools/applications, object-oriented, define once use many times\methodology does not alter the underlying, in situ well understood processes.  A thorough understanding of the Big Picture, without the complexity of tool specific nuisances, will provide a bridge to adapting to the change to MBSE.  This is what the Data Architecture delivers  7  P ROCESS O VERVIEW E XAMPLE  This process describes examples of major steps to fulfill the mandatory compliance requirements per Systems Engineering [2 a nd P r o gr a m  P r o j e c t M a na ge m e nt  Processes and Requirements T h ey in cl u d e a too l  agnostic Data Architecture Framework overview of the integrated processes and steps necessary to implement the Program/Project SE and PM in an MBSE environment.

The technology transfer that is needed is the adaptation of military technology for civilian  applications the freeing up of flight restrictions to stimulate application development, and the generation of revenue in the private sector through delivery of new ways of gathering information and converting that information for commercial use 227 whether  to reduce cost of existing activities or create new opportunities  Technology transfer can be divided into two major categories:  the transfer of aviation technology to manned flight, and the transfer of sensor technologies for adaptation in the civil mar ket  Aviation Technology 227 this is mainly  technology deployed in avionics  i.e systems that control flight, provide navigation, and support systems monitoring  Some examples of short term technology transfer opportunities include   Small autopilots that can be adapted for use in general aviation aircraft to improve performance and offer value added features at lower cost. The technology transfer is geared toward adapting autonomous flight opportunities from UASs to general aviation a ircraft   Sense and avoid technologies could aid general aviation safety, since most general aviation aircraft do not carry collision avoidance systems   Fuel and engine management systems used for optimizing loiter can be added to a Pilot Assistant for man ned aircraft  Autonomy must pass a major hurdle, that of attaining what the Air Force calls \223certifiable trust in autonomy.\224 The processes for certification are an area of joint collaboration between the military and civil sectors. New methods of Verifica tion and Validation \(V&V\ will be needed, and this V&V must be certifiably reliable, meaning there are scientific and engineering processes to prove performance  Sensor Technology 227 Electro optical video and IR, synthetic aperture radars, ground penetrating  radars, laser targeting systems make up the suite of current sensors. T he trend is to  produce the same or better performance with less system weight systems. This is coupled with the use of signal and information processing to improve the product sensing  for the operator. Approximately 80 percent of the commercial market will be realized in small UASs, where weight is a key factor. The vast majority of the users of the information the sensors capture will not be for a warfighter mission Therefore, inform ation presentation in usable forms will be essential to commercial success  Mapping technologies will need to be adapted to accept UAS derived information. The fight track, the sensor data and the underlying mapping must merge in order to realize the ben efits of sensor payloads on UAS. The technology transfer is a combination of information registry and visualization coupled with greater virtual reality

While the initial market will be in producing the flying pl atform and its sensors, the longer term market is in the information the sensors produce. When coupled with detailed mapping information through a geographical information system \(GIS new opportunities are created, from the farmer or rancher, to the larg e timber company, to water management authorities, to any case where a business involves land use  While most of the UAS industry is focused on a derivative of current military uses for security and police operations the civil industry is looking to use the UAS as a platform to produce revenue from the data derived through the sensors  Taking a longer view, the benefits are clear   Lower labor costs to accomplish tasks that are now performed by manned flight     Lower labor costs through a faster way to aut onomously gather information needed     Lower labor costs in land use field surveys and management    Greater use of information to manage application of water, fertilizers, pesticides, timing of crop harvests and management to produce greater yields \(from cor n to timber    Improvements in water management and allocation through use of GIS technologies paired with UAS sensor information    Reduced cost of environmental oversight and enforcement    Improved public safety through surveillance    Improved flight safety t hrough technology transfer from UAS to manned flight operations    Recognition of UAS flights as a data collection tool with the market driven by the information gained   Ease of operation to attain the data through information processing and presentation   The commercialization of UAS technology  and its capability to collect surveillance information  is limited by constraints imposed by the federal regulatory actions aviation\ and by general citizen concern over law enforcement applications of surveillance a nd the right to privacy. Both of these barriers will be overcome, but not without an impact on the economics of UAS. This delay will likely defer commercialization benefits and present additional obstacles to market entry  6  M ARKET B ARRIERS  Legal and Regulatory Policies and Procedures  The anticipated expansion of UAS into a myriad of public private, and commercial missions routinely using the national airspace alongside other air traffic has highlighted both the UAS operational needs and the public co ncerns associated with those operations. The Federal Aviation Authority\222s FAA's   Interim Operational Approval Guidance 08 01  gives the rules for gaining approval to operate UAS in the NAS and the operating limitations that are imposed on those flights. In  general, the rules for manned aircraft governing vehicle airworthiness, pilots maintenance, and use of the airspace have been directly applied to UAS operations with the caveat that relaxation of some of these rules may be granted if FAA accepts an opera tor proposed safety case using the regulatory process known as Alternate Methods of Compliance." Lacking that the UA S  must meet equivalent certification standards usually experimental category\, and be flown by a licensed pilot. Except in Class A airspa ce, UAS must be flown in VMC in sight of the pilot or, if a chase plane is used, in sight of the observer. UAS are to be maintained like a manned aircraft. All UAS flights in the NAS require a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization \(COA\, typically valid f or up to a year, obtained by submitting an application and receiving specific approval by the FAA  T he time and cost barriers these policies and procedures place in the way of achieving UAS benefits  are well documented Efforts are under way at FAA and th rough the RTCA Special Committee s  203  and 228  to create standards specifically for UAS of varying size and sophistication and for realistic operating procedures which would permit using their unique capabilities while still safeguarding the public Once in  place, these new standards will eliminate the time consuming COA process  Social Issues  Even when these technical and safety concerns are overcome, there is still a growing barrier to widespread use of UAS in the NAS brought on by the public's privacy con cerns. The most widely used mission for UAS is ISR, or more simply, surveillance. As many missions provide low altitude, high resolution surveillance, the privacy rights of citizens caught collaterally in the surveillance, must be protected  Articles in th e popular press have conjured up visions of thousands of prying eyes in the sky watching every move a person makes and continuously advising the authorities of individual's locations and activities. Even though a pro UAS bill was recently passed mandating the FAA to integrate UAS into the NAS by 2015   the government will also have to deal with the public's concern over privacy and the fears created by seeing numerous drones overhead, often at low altitude, regardless of how noble the purpose of their missio n  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  13  Environmental Impacts  Many proposed UAS missions identified earlier would place the vehicles in close proximity to persons who are not directly involved in the UAS operation. Civilian store deliver ies for example, could require a package drop off in cl ose vicinity to populated areas  The noise produced by the UAV being close to people could mean the difference between the success or failure of this type of business  Helicopters are notoriously loud noise producers Additionally, their blades are hazardous to be around. The wind produced by their hovering lift can also be strong enough to damage articles that are not either heavy or tied down. The fumes and gaseous e missions produced by the powerplants will be subject to the same environmental scrutiny  of all other transportation appliances and vehicles  Larger payloads and long endurance can be achieved quietly using lighter than air \(LTA\ or hybrid LTA vehicles with  multi mode propulsion capabilities. The lift required to keep large payloads aloft is not obtained aerodynamically, but through buoyancy, which is completely silent. This lift also produces no emissions, so if the thrust can be hybrid electric, most envir onmental concerns can be overcome.  A hybrid turbine electric propulsion system may also be capable of providing low noise periods of flight before and after which batteries are re charged.  The basic idea is that a battery powered ducted fan eliminates th e need for noisy gearboxes to operate during a noise sensitive leg of flight D Star Engineering is prototyping such a capability with funding from the I ntelligent Advanced research Projects Agency \(I ARPA   Other  There are other more subtle potential barri ers to acceptance of widespread use of UAS in the NAS Cost is still a significant factor for all but recreational radio controlled models. The costs of even experimental certification, pilot and mechanic training, salaries for pilots, mechanics, and other  mission specialists needed to carry out a drone mission, and the still relatively poor accident record for UAS, which can result in total loss of the expensive vehicles, are all substantial  Insurance costs for UAS operations over cities and towns are st ill being determined as actuarial data is slowly accumulated.  No matter how quiet or clean it is, the sight of a large vehicle passing overhead where none had been before may  draw complaints and political pressure to restrict or ban their operations  This  is not to suggest that these barriers cannot be overcome to the benefit of many domestic civil and military UAS missions. The concerns need to be understood and addressed so that their potential to stop the use of UAS is neutralized The technical barrier s are much simpler to overcome than the political and social ones, so continuous public education about the benefits of UAS use and the measures taken to ensure the safety and privacy of the general public is essential  7   UAS  F UTURE F ORECASTS  From resourc es reviewed during the study, the team developed the two forecasts: one for the military and public growth of  UAS  Figure 5  and one for the growth in civil use UAS  Figure 6  Under the FAA perspective   the definition of \223public\224 means federal agencies, s tate and local government organization \(including law enforcement and public universities These curves represent market 223demand\224 projections   Figure 5 2015 2035 Forecast for UAS DoD and Public  UAS   Figure 6 2015 2035 Forecast for Total Public and  Commercial UAS  8   C ONSTRAINTS AND I NFLUENCES ON UAS  T ECHNOLOGY  The technical team participating in the study  identified  listing of the top factors  that most likely will constrain UAS growth   These factors are  integrated functions drawn from the study areas when view ed as total system.

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
