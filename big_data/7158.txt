Although several studies have been carried out, current methods may present too many high utility itemsets for users which degrades the performance of the mining task in terms of execution and memory efficiency. To achieve high efficiency for the mining task and provide a concise mining result to users, we propose a novel framework in this paper for mining closed  high utility itemsets which serves as a compact and lossless representation of high utility itemsets. We present an efficient algorithm called CHUD  Closed  High Utility itemset Discovery for mining closed  high utility itemsets. Further, a method called DAHU  Derive All High Utility itemsets

Results of experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CHUD and DAHU are very efficient with a massive reduction \(up to 800 times in our experiments\mber of high utility itemsets. In ad dition, when all high utility itemsets are recovered by DAHU the approach combining CHUD and DAHU also outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in mining high utility itemsets Keywords-utility mining; frequent itemset; closed  high utility itemset; lossless and concise representation I 
  I NTRODUCTION  Frequent itemset mining abbreviated as FIM\ [1  fundamental research topic in data mining. One of its popular applications is market basket analysis which refers to the discovery of sets of items \(itemsets\ that are frequently purchased together by customers. However, in this application, the traditional model of FIM may discover a large amount of frequent itemsets with low profit and lose the information on valuable itemsets having low selling frequencies. These problems are caused by the facts that \(1 FIM treats all items as having the same importance/unit profit/weight and \(2\ it assumes that every item in a transaction appears in a binary form, i.e., an item can be either present or absent in a transaction, which doesnêt indicate its purchase quantity in the transaction. Hence, FIM 
cannot satisfy the requirement of users who desire to discover itemsets with high utilities such as high profits To address these issues, utility mining [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 13, 15, 19, 20 e m er ge s as an i m por t a n t topic i n da ta  mining. In utility mining, each item has a weight \(e.g. unit profit\ and can appear more than once in each transaction e.g. purchase quantity\The utility of an itemset represents its importance, which can be measured in terms of weight profit, cost, quantity or other information depending on the user preference. An itemset is called a high utility itemset  abbreviated as HUI\f its utility is no less than a userspecified minimum utility threshold Utility mining has a wide range of applications such as website click stream analysis [2, 5, 19 ossm a r k e t i n g  a n al ysis 6  2 0 26 
and biomedical domains [7 However, HUIs mining is not an easy task since the downward closure property 1, 10  in FIM does not ho ld i n  utility mining. The search space cannot be directly pruned to find HUIs as in FIM since a superset of a low utility itemset can be a high utility itemset. Many studies [2, 13, 15, 20 were proposed for mining HUIs, but they often present a large number of high utility itemsets to users such that comprehension of the results becomes difficult. Meanwhile the algorithms become inefficient in terms of time and memory requirement. In particular, the performance of the mining task decreases greatly under low minimum utility thresholds or dense databases To reduce the computational cost in FIM while presenting fewer and more important patterns to users, many studies developed concise representations, such as 
free sets 3 nonderivable sets  maximal itemsets 9 nd closed itemsets  14, 16-18 22, 27  Th es e r epresenta t i ons suc cess f ully r edu c e  the set of itemsets found, but they were developed for frequent itemset mining instead of high utility itemset mining Therefore, an important research question is Is it possible to conceive a compact and lossless representation of high utility itemsets inspired by these representations to address the aforementioned issues in HUI mining  Answering this question positively is not easy Developing a concise and complete representation of HUIs poses several challenges 1  Integrating concepts of concise representations from 
FIM into HUI mining may produce a lossy representation of all HUIs or a representation that is not meaningful to the users 2  The representation may not achieve a significant reduction in the number of extracted patterns to justify using the representation 3  Algorithms for extracting the representation may not be efficient. They may be slower than the best algorithms for mining all HUIs 4  It may be hard to develop an efficient method for recovering all HUIs from the representation In this paper, we address all of these challenges by proposing a condensed and meaningful representation of

HUIs named Closed  High Utility Itemsets Closed  HUIs which integrates  the concept of closed itemset into HUI mining. Our contributions are four-fold in correspondence to resolving the four challenges mentioned previously 1  The proposed representation is lossless by using a new structure named utility unit array that allows recovering all HUIs and their utilities efficiently 2  The proposed representation is also compact  Experiments show that it reduces the number of itemsets by several orders of magnitude, especially for datasets containing long HUIs \(up to 800 times 3  We propose an efficient algorithm, named CHUD   C losed   H igh U tility itemset D iscovery\, to find this representation. It includes three novel strategies named REG  RML and DCM that greatly enhance its performance.  Results show that CHUD is much faster than current best methods for mining all HUIs [2  4  We propose a top-down method named DAHU  D erive A ll H igh U tility itemsets\for efficiently recovering all HUIs from the set of Closed  HUIs. The combination of CHUD and DAHU provides a new way to obtain all HUIs and it outperforms UPGrowth 20 t h e st ate-of the-art algorithm for mining HUIs The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the background for compact representations and utility mining. Section III defines the representation of closed  HUIs and presents our methods Experiments are shown in Section IV and conclusions are given in Section V TABLE I  A N EXAMPLE TRANSACTIONAL DATABASE  TID Transaction TU T 1  1\W\(1 5 T 2  3 8 T 3  2 8 T 4 E\(2\G\(1 5 T 5  3 11 TABLE II  U NIT PROFITS FOR EVERY ITEM  Item A B E F G W Unit Profit 1 1 2 3 1 1 II  B ACKGROUND  In this section, we introduce the preliminaries associated with high utility itemset mining and compact representations A  High Utility itemset Mining Let I  a 1  a 2  a M be a finite set of distinct items A transactional database  D  T 1  T 2  T N is a set of transactions, where each transaction T R 002 D 1 \002 R 002 N s a subset of I and has an unique identifier R called Tid Each item a i 002 I is associated with a positive real number p  a i  D  called its external utility Every item a i in the transaction T R  has a real number q  a i  T R called its internal utility An itemset X  a 1  a 2  a K is a set of K distinct items, where a i  002 I 1 \002 i 002 K and K is the length of X A K itemset is an itemset of length K An itemset X is said to be contained in a transaction T R if X 003 T R  Definition 1 The support count of an itemset X is defined as the number of transactions containing X in D and denoted as SC  X The support of X is defined as the ratio of SC  X o  D The complete set of all the itemsets in D is denoted as L  and L  X | X 003 I  SC  X   0 Definition 2 The utility of an item  a i  in a transaction  T R  is denoted as u  a i  T R defined as p  a i  D  q  a i  T R  Definition 3 The utility of an itemset X in a transaction  T R  is denoted as u  X  T R efined as u  X  T R  002    013p R i i X a T a u  Definition 4 The utility of an itemset X in D is denoted as u  X and defined as u  X  002  013p  013x  013r R R R    D T T X T X u  Definition 5 An itemset X is called high utility itemset if u  X  is no less than a user-specified minimum utility threshold min_utility Otherwise X is a low utility itemset  Definition 6 Let S be a set of itemsets and a function f H  S   X | X 002 S  u  X  004 min_utility The complete set of HUIs in D is denoted as H  H  013r  L and defined as f H  L   The problem of mining HUIs is to find the set H in D   Example 1 Let Table I be a database containing five transactions. Each row in Table I represents a transaction, in which each letter represents an item and has a purchase quantity \(internal utility\he unit profit of each item is shown in Table II \(external utility\. In Table I, the utility of the item {F} in the transaction T 3 is u F T 3  p F D  q F T 3 2 = 6. The utility of {BF} in T 3 is u BF T 3  u B T 3  u F T 3 1 + 6 = 7. The utility of {BF is u BF u BF T 3  u BF T 5 nce {BF} is contained in T 3 and T 5 If the min_utility is set to 10, the set of HUIs in Table I is H E}:12, {F}:15, {AE}:10 AF}:17, {BE}:10, {BF}:17, {ABE}:12, {ABF}:19 where the number beside each itemset is its utility Note that the utility constraint is neither monotone nor anti-monotone In other words, a superset of a low utility itemset can be high utility and a subset of a high utility itemset can be low utility.  Hence, we cannot directly use the anti-monotone property \(also known as downward closure property to prune the search space. To facilitate the mining task, Liu et al. introduced the concept of transaction-weighted downward closure  ich is based on the following definitions Definition 7 The transaction utility of a transaction T R is denoted as TU  T R and defined as u  T R  T R  Definition 8  The transaction-weighted utilization of an itemset X is the sum of the transaction utilities of all the transactions containing X which is denoted as TWU  X d defined as TWU  X  002  013p  013x  013r R R R   D T T X T TU   Definition 9 An itemset X is a high transaction-weighted utilization itemset  HTWUI f TWU  X  004  min_utility Property 1 The transaction-weighted downward closure property states that for any itemset X that is not a HTWUI all its supersets are low utility itemsets [2, 13, 15, 20

For example, the transaction utilities of T 1 and T 3 are TU  T 1  u ABE T 1   and TU  T 3 8. W hen min_utility 10  AB} is a HTWUI since TWU AB TU  T 1  TU  T 3 13 is no less than min_utility In contrast the itemset {W} is not a HTWUI, and therefore all the supersets of {W} are low utility itemsets Many studies have been proposed for mining HUIs including Two-Phase  IHUP 2   TWU-Mining  IIDS 15  a n d  UPGrowth  Two-Phase  IHUP and TWUMining utilize transaction-weighted downward closure property to find high utility itemsets. They consist of two phases. In phase I, they find all HTWUIs from the database In phase II, high utility itemsets are identified from the set of HTWUIs by scanning the original database once Although these methods capture the complete set of HUIs they may generate too many candidates in phase I, i.e HTWUIs, which degrades the performance of phase II and the overall performance \(in terms of time and space\. To reduce the number of candidates in phase I, various methods have been proposed \(e.g. [15 Recentl y  T s eng et al proposed UPGrowth with four strategies DGU  DGN  DLU  and DLN for mining HUIs. Experiments in [2  show t h at the number of candidates generated by UPGrowth in phase I can be order of magnitudes smaller than that of HTWUIs To the best of our knowledge, UPGrowth is the state-of-theart method for mining HUIs Although the above methods perform well in some case their performance degrades quickly when there are many HUIs in the databases. A large number of HUIs and candidates cause these methods to suffer from long execution time and huge memory consumption. When the system resources are limited \(the memory, disk space or processing power\, it is often impractical to generate the entire set of HUIs. Besides, a large amount of HUIs is hard to be comprehended or analyzed by users. In FIM, to reduce the number of patterns, many studies were conducted to develop compact representations of frequent itemsets that eliminate redundancy, such as free sets 3   non-derivable sets   maximal itemsets  closed itemsets  Although these representations achieve a significant reduction in the number of extracted frequent itemsets, some of them lead to loss of informatio   To provi de n o t only compact but also complete information about frequent itemsets to users, many studies were conducted on closed itemset mining B  Closed Itemset Mining In this subsection, we introduce definitions and properties related to closed itemsets and mention relevant methods. For more details about closed itemsets, readers can refer to [14, 16-18, 22, 27 Definition 10 The Tidset of an itemset X is denoted as g  X  and defined as the set of Tids of transactions containing X   The support count of an itemset X is expressed in terms of g  X  SC  X  g  X   Property 2 For itemsets X  Y 013p L  SC  X 002 Y g X  003 g Y  Definition 11 The closure of an itemset  X 013p  L denoted as C  X is the largest set Y 013p  L  such that X 013r Y and SC  X  SC  Y Alternatively, it is defined as C  X   R     013p T X g R 003  Property 3 015 X 013p L  SC  X  SC  C  X  015  g  X  g  C  X   Definition 12 An itemset X 013p L is a closed itemset if there exists no itemset Y 013p L such that \(1 X 005 Y and \(2 SC  X  SC  Y Otherwise X is a non-closed itemset An equivalent definition is that X is closed if C  X  X For example, {B is non-closed since C B T 1 003 T 2 003 T 3 003 T 5 AB Definition 13 Let S be a set of itemsets and a function f C  S   X| X 002 S  015  Y 002 S such that X 013t Y and SC  X  SC  Y he complete  set of closed itemsets in D is denoted as C  C 013r L  and defined as f C  L For example, the set of closed itemsets in Table I is C E}:3, {EG}:1, {AB}:4, {ABE}:2 ABF}:2, {ABEW}:1}, in which the number beside each itemset is its support count Property 4 015 X 013p  L  SC  X  max  SC  Y  Y 013p  f C  L  013x   X 013r Y For example, the supersets of {B} in f C  L  AB}:4, {ABE}:2, {ABF}:2 and {ABEW}:1. Thus SC B}\ is the maximum of these support counts, i.e. 4 Mining frequent closed itemset refers to the discovery of all the closed itemsets whose supports are no less than a user-specified threshold. It is widely recognized that the number of frequent closed itemsets can be much smaller than the set of frequent itemsets for real-life databases and that mining frequent closed itemsets can also be much faster and memory efficient than mining frequent itemsets [14, 22 2   The set o f closed ite m set s i s  lossless since all frequent itemsets and their supports can be easily derived from it by property 4 without scanning the original database [16-18  Many efficient methods were proposed for mining frequent closed itemsets, such as A-Close 16-18   CLOSET 2 CHARM   an d DCI-Closed 1  Howev e r  the s e methods do not consider the utility of itemsets. Therefore they may present lots of closed itemsets with low utilities to users and omit several high utility itemsets C  Compact Representations of High Utility Itemsets To present representative HUIs to users, some concise representations of HUIs were proposed. Chan et al introduced the concept of utility frequent closed patterns  However, it is based on a definition of high utility itemset that is different from [2, 13  and our work. Shi e et a l  proposed a compact representation of high utility itemsets called maximal high utility itemset and  the GUIDE algorithm for mining it HUI i s said to b e maximal if it is not a subset of any other HUI. For example, when min_utility 10 the set of maximal HUIs is {{ABE}, {ABF}}. Although this representation reduces the number of extracted HUIs, it is not lossless. The reason is that the utilities of the subsets of a maximal HUI cannot be known without scanning the database. Besides, recovering all HUIs from maximal HUIs can be very inefficient because many subsets of a maximal HUI can be low utility 002 Another problem is that the GUIDE  algorithm cannot capture the complete set of maximal HUIs

III  C LOSED   H IGH U TILITY I TEMSET M INING  In this section, we incorporate the concept of closed itemset with high utility itemset mining to develop a representation named closed  high utility itemset We theoretically prove that this new representation is meaningful  lossless and not larger than the set of all HUIs A  Pushing Closed Property into HUI Mining The first point that we should discuss is how to incorporate the closed constraint into high utility itemset mining. There are several possibilities. First, we can define the closure on the utility of itemsets. In this case, a high utility itemset is said to be closed if it has no proper superset having the same utility. However, this definition is unlikely to achieve a high reduction of the number of extracted itemsets since not many itemsets have exactly the same utility as their supersets in real datasets. For example, there are seven HUIs in Example 1 and only one itemset {E} is non-closed, since {E 013r ABE} and u E u ABE}\12 A second possibility is to define the closure on the supports of itemsets. In this case, there are two possible definitions depending on the join order between the closed constraint and the utility constraint 006  Mine all the high utility itemsets first and then apply closed constraint. We formally define this set as H  f C  f H  L It follows that H 013r H  006  Mine all the closed itemsets first and then apply the utility constraint. We formally define this set as C  f H  f C  L It follows that C 013r C  As indicated in [23 t h e join  order  bet w een two constraints often lead to different results. Therefore, our next step is to analyze the result sets defined based on the above two join orders. We show that they produce the same result set by the following lemmas Lemma 1  H  013r C Proof We prove that H  013r C by proving that 015 X 013p H  002  X 013p C Since X 013p  H  X 013p  H and u  X  002 min_utility   Then we prove that  015  Y 013p H such that X 013t Y and SC  X  SC  Y  yields X 013p C by showing that X 007 C contradicts Y 013p H If X 007 C there must exists an itemset Y 013p L such that X 013t Y and SC  X  SC  Y By Definition 4 u  Y  u  X  002  min_utility   and therefore Y 013p H   which is a contradiction  Lemma 2  C  013r H   Proof We prove that C  013r H by proving that 015 X 013p C  002  X 013p  H Since X 013p C and u  X  002  min_utility we have X 013p H  Then, we prove that X 013p C yields 015  Y 013p H such that X 013t Y  and SC\(X  SC  Y by showing that 015 Y 013p H contradicts X 007 C If Y 002 H then Y 013p L Because X 013t Y  Y 013p L and SC  X  SC  Y follows that X 007 C   Theorem 1  H  C  Proof This directly follows from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 Because the two join orders produce the same result, we remove the join order to obtain a general definition Definition 14 We define the set of closed high utility itemsets as HC  X  X 013p  L  X  C  X  u  X  002 min_utility  HC  H  C An itemset X is called a non-closed high utility itemset if X 013p  H and X  007 C For example, the set of closed HUIs in Table I is HC E}, {ABE}, {ABF Definition 14 gives an alternative solution to incorporate the closed constraint with high utility itemset mining. The advantage of using this definition is that the two constraints can be applied in any order during the mining process. We say that the representation HC is concise because its size is guaranteed to be no larger than the set of all HUIs \(because HC 013r H   We next show that this representation is meaningful  Property 5 For any non-closed high utility itemset X  015 Y 013p  HC such that Y= C  X  u  Y  u  X  Proof  015 X 013p  L  015 Y 013p  C such that Y= C  X and SC  X  SC  Y nce X 013p  H and X 007 C  u  X  002  min_utility and X 013t Y  SC  X  SC  Y and X 013t Y yields u  Y  u  X  002  min_utility by Property 3 and Definition 4 We claim that  HC is a meaningful representation of all HUIs by Property 5. For any non-closed high utility itemset X  X does not appear in a transaction without its closure Y  Moreover, the utility \(e.g. profit/user preference\ of Y is guaranteed to be higher than the utility of X For these reasons, users are more interested in finding Y than X  Moreover, closed itemsets having high utilities are useful in many applications. For example, in market basket analysis Y  is the closure of X means that  no customer purchase X  without its closure Y Thus, when a customer purchase X the retailer can recommend Y-X to the customer, to maximize profit  Although HC is based on the concise representation of closed itemsets,  the set of closed HUIs is not lossless. If an itemset is not included in this representation,  there is no way to infer its utility and to know whether it is high utility or not To tackle this problem, we attach to each closed HUI a special structure named utility unit array which is defined as follows Definition 15 015 X  a 1 a 2   a K  013p  L the utility unit array  of X is denoted as V  X  v 1  v 2  v K  d c o nt ains K utility values. The i th utility value v i in V  X is denoted as V  X  a i  and defined as 002    R i  013p  013x    013p  R i T a X g R T a u  For example, consider the itemset {ABE} appearing in T 1  and T 2 The first utility value in V ABE V ABE}, {A  u A T 1  u A T 2 2. The utility unit array of {ABE is V ABE}\= [2, 2 Property 6 015 X  a 1 a 2   a K  013p  L  u  X  002 1  i    K i a X V  Proof The utility of X is the sum of the utilities of items a 1  a 2   a K in transactions containing X For an item a i the value  V  X  a i esents the sum of the utilities of a i in transactions containing X Therefore u  X ed as V  X  a 1  V  X  a 2  V  X  a K ample u ABE V ABE}, {A V ABE}, {B V ABE E Property 7 015 X 013p  L  X is low utility if C  X  007 HC  
827 


Proof If  C  X  007 HC  u  C  X  min_utility Since SC  X  SC  C  X  X 013r C  X Definition 4 we have u  X  002  u  C  X  min_utility  Property 8 015 X  a 1 a 2   a K  013p  L the utility of X can be calculated as u  X  002      013p i i X a a X C V by using the utility unit array of its closure if C  X  013p  HC  Proof Because X 013r C  X there exists an entry V  C  X  a i n V  C  X for each a i 013p X Besides g  X  g  C  X since SC  X   SC  C  X  X 013r C  X Property 3\. Therefore V  X  a i  V  C  X  a i by Definition 15. According to Property 6 u  X   002    1  i K i a X V By replacing V  X  a i th V  C  X  a i we obtain Property 8 Definition 16 An itemset X is called a closed   high utility itemset abbreviated as CHUI\ if X 013p  HC and X is annotated with V  X The set of closed  HUIs is a lossless representation of all HUIs. For any itemset X 013p H its exact utility can be inferred from the utility unit array of its closure by Property 8 without scanning the original database Although the set of closed  HUIs is meaningful  concise  and lossless mining closed  HUIs is not an easy task. There are two naive methods. The first one is to find all HUIs and then to remove non-closed itemsets. The main drawbacks of this method are that it cannot be more efficient than mining all HUIs and that in the worst case removing all non-closed itemset requires comparing all HUIs with each other. The second approach is to first mine all closed itemsets and then to remove those that are low utility itemsets. The drawback of this method is that it needs to generate all closed itemsets and this set can be very large since no threshold can be used B  Efficient Discovery of Closed  High Utility Itemsets In this subsection, we present an efficient algorithm named CHUD  C losed   H igh U tility itemset D iscovery\or mining closed  HUIs. CHUD is an extension of DCI-Closed 14  one of t h e curr ent b e s t  m etho ds for m i n i n g close d itemsets, and it also integrates the TWU model and effective strategies to prune low utility itemsets. CHUD consists of two phases. In phase I, CHUD discovers candidates for closed  HUIs. In phase II, the closed  HUIs are identified from the set of candidates found in phase I and their utility unit  arrays are computed by scanning the database once Similar to the DCI-Closed algorithm, CHUD adopts an IT-Tree Itemset-Tidset pair Tree\14, 27 to  find cl ose d   HUIs. In an IT-Tree, each node N  X consists of an itemset X  its Tidset g  X and two ordered sets of items named PREVSET X SET X The IT-Tree is recursively explored by the CHUD algorithm until all closed itemsets that are HTWUIs are generated. Different from the DCIClosed algorithm, each node N  X f the IT-Tree is attached with an estimated utility value EstU  X  A data structure called TU-Table  T ransaction U tility Table  p te d for s t o r i ng the transa cti on  ut i li t ies o f transactions. It is a list of pairs R  TU  T R ere the first value is a TID R and the second value is the transaction utility of T R Given a TID R the value TU  T R be efficiently retrieved from the TU-Table. Given a node N  X  with its Tidset g  X a TU-Table TU the estimated utility of the itemset X can be efficiently calculated by the procedure shown in Figure 1 The main procedure of CHUD is named Main and  is shown in Figure 2. It takes as parameter a database D and the min_utility threshold  CHUD first scans D once to convert D into a vertical database. At the same time, CHUD computes the transaction utility for each transaction T R and calculates TWU of items. When a transaction is retrieved its Tid and transaction utility are loaded into a global  TUTable  named GTU An item is called a promising item if its estimated utility \(e.g. its TWU\no less than min_utility  After the first scan of database, promising items are collected into an ordered list O = <a 1  a 2    a n  sorted according to a fixed order 004 such as increasing order of support  Only promising items are kept in O since supersets of unpromising items are low utility itemsets. According to  h e ut ilit i es of un pr o m is i n g i te m s c an be r e m oved  f r o m  the GTU table. This step is performed at line 2 of the Main  procedure. Then, CHUD generates candidates in a recursive manner, starting from candidates containing a single promising item and recursively joining items to them to form larger candidates. To do so, CHUD takes advantage of the fact that by using the total order 004 the complete set of itemsets can be divided into n non-overlapping subspaces where the k th subspace is the set of itemsets containing the item a k but no item a i 004 a k 1 Fo r each ite m  a k 002 O CHUD creates a node N  a k   and puts items a 1 to a k-1 into PREVSET a k and items a k+1 to a n into POST-SET a k Then CHUD  calls the CHUDPhaseI procedure for each node N  a k   to produce all the candidates containing the item a k  but no item a i 004 a k Finally, the Main procedure performs phase II on these candidates to obtain all closed  HUIs CalculateEstUtility  g  X  TU  01 Est U := 0 02 for each TID R 013p g  X   do  03 EstU  EstU  TU.get  R  04 return  Est U Figure 1  CalculateEstUtility Main  D  min_utility  01 InitialDatabaseScan  D  02 RemoveUtilityUnpromisingItems  O  GTU  03 for each item a k 013p O  do  04 Create node N  a k  05  CHUDPhaseI  N  a k  GTU  min_utility  06 Apply Strategy 3\(REG 07 PerformPhaseII  D  Figure 2  Main CHUDPhaseI  N X  TU  min_utility  01 if  SubsumeCheck  N  X PREV-SET X false then  02  X C  ComputeClosure  N  X POST-SET X  03  if  EstU  X C  002  min_utility  then Apply Strategy 5\(DCM 04  Output X C with EstU  X C  05 Explore  N  X C  TU  min_utility  Figure 3  CHUDPhase-I SubsumeCheck  N  X PREV-SET X  01 for each item a 013p PREV-SET X  do  02 if   g  X  013r  g  a  then  return  true  03 return  false  Figure 4  SubsumeCheck

The procedure first performs SubsumeCheck on X as presented in  Figure 4. This check verifies if there exists an item a from PREV-SET\(X  such that g  X  013r g  a f there exists such an item, it means that X  is included in a closed itemset that has already been found and supersets of X do not need to be explored \(see [1  f o r a  complete justification\. Otherwise, the next step is to compute the closure X C  C  X   of X This is performed by the procedure ComputeClosure  N  X POST-SET X  shown in Figure 5 [1 n t he es t i m a t e d uti lity of X C is calculated. If it is no less than min_utility  X C is considered as a candidate for Phase II and it is outputted with its estimated utility value EstU  X C ote that CHUD does not maintain any discovered candidate in memory. Instead when a candidate itemset is found, it is outputted to disk After this, a node N  X C is created and the procedure Explore is called for finding candidates that are supersets of X C  The Explore procedure is shown in Figure 6. It takes as parameter a node N  X a TU-Table and the min_utility  threshold. The Explore procedure explores the search space of closed candidates that are superset of X by appending items from POST-SET X o X We here briefly explain this process. For a proof that this method is a correct way of exploring closed candidates, the reader can consult the paper describing DCI-Closed  14  For each ite m  a k of POSTSET X he procedure first removes a k  from POST-SET X   to create a node N  Y ith Y  X 004\026  a k The Tidset of Y is then calculated as g  Y  g  X  004\025 g  a k Property 2. The set POST-SET Y   and PREV-SET Y   are respectively set to POST-SET X   and PREV-SET X Then, the estimated utility of Y is calculated by calling the CalculateEstUtility  procedure with g  Y d TU If EstU  Y d EstU  X are no less than min_utility the procedure CHUDPhaseI is recursively called with N  Y   to consider the search space of Y and a k  is added to PREV-SET X   If EstU  Y s lower than min_utility the search space of Y is pruned since Y and its supersets are low utility itemsets \(Property 1  After recursions of the Explore and CHUDPhaseI procedures are completed, closed candidates that have been outputted are processed by phase II. Phase II consists of taking each candidate X and to calculate its exact utility and utility unit array. Each candidate that is a low utility itemset is discarded. Calculating the exact utility of a candidate X is performed by doing the summation of u  X  T R for each R 013p g  X This is done very efficiently thanks to the vertical representation of the database \(only transactions containing X are considered to calculate its utility We now prove that this basic version of the CHUD algorithm generates the complete set of closed  HUIs. We consider the two phases of CHUD to prove the correctness The first phase produces a set of candidates P 013r  C since it is based on the DCI-Closed algorithm that generates all closed itemsets C see [1 or the proo f that DCI Clo s ed generates C The second phase consists of discarding candidates that are low utilities from P to obtain C The algorithm is therefore correct if and only if C  013r  P the set of candidates P produced in Phase I contains all closed   HUIs C To prove this, we need to show that the modifications that have been made to DCI-Closed will not discard any closed  high utility itemset X  013r  C We discuss the correctness of these modifications thereafter Strategy 1. Considering only promising items The first strategy that we have incorporated in CHUD is to only consider promising items for generating candidates and to remove the utilities of unpromising items from the GTU table. It is applied in line 2 and 3 of the Main procedure Rationale It was shown in th at u npro m isi ng ite m s  cannot be part of a HUI and that the utility of unpromising items can be ignored in the calculation of the estimated utility of itemsets when searching for high utility itemsets Strategy 2. Discarding itemsets having an estimated utility lower than min_utility The second strategy in CHUD is to discard the itemset X C such that EstU  X C  002  min_utility This strategy is integrated in line 3 of the CHUDPhaseI procedure Rationale It was demonstrated in Section 2 that an itemset that is not a HWTUI is not a high utility itemset as well as all of its supersets \(see Property 1 and Definition 4, 8 and 9  Because DCI-Closed discovers candidates recursively by considering supersets of candidates, discarding an itemset such that EstU  X C  min_utility will not discard any itemset from P that is in C  To enhance the performance of CHUD, we integrate three additional strategies, which have never been used in vertical mining of HUIs. They are described as follows Strategy 3. Removing the Exact utilities of items from the Global TU-Table \(REG Strategy 3 is called REG  which is applied after line 5 of the procedure Main Each time that an item a k 013p O has been processed u  a k  removed from the transaction utility of each transaction containing a k  in the global TU-Table 
829 


Rationale CHUD explores the search space of patterns by dividing it into non-overlapping subspaces such that each item a i  that has been processed is excluded from the subspace of item a j 005 a i Therefore u  a i be removed from the transaction utility of each transaction containing a j  in the global TU-Table  The pseudo code for this strategy is shown as follows  06 for each Tid R 013p  g  a k  do  07   remove  u  a k  from   R GTU T R  Definition 17 The minimum item utility of an item a  is  denoted as miu  a d defined as the value u  a  T r or which 015   T s  013p  D such that u  a  T s  u  a  T r  Definition 18 Let N X\ be a node for the itemset X and a be an item in POST-SET\(X\The local TU-Table for the node Y = X 004\026  a is denoted as TU Y and is initialized with the entries from TU X corresponding to transactions from g  Y  The local TU-Table for the root node of the IT-Tree is GTU Strategy 4. Removing the Mius of items from Local TUTables \(RML Strategy 4 is called RML which is applied after line 11 of the procedure Explore This strategy consists of using a local TU-Table TU X for each node N X\ in the IT-Tree. Let Y  X 002  a k and N Y be the child node of N X  Each time that an item a k from POST-SET\(X\ is processed miu  a k is removed from the transaction utility of each transaction containing a k  in TU X The updated local TUTable TU X is  used for all child nodes of N X  This process reduces the estimated utility of N X\  and that of its children nodes. Besides miu  a k  SC  Y removed from EstU  X  If the updated EstU  X is less than min_utility the algorithm will not process X 002  a k for each item a k 013p POST-SET X  Rationale Each item a i  that is processed for a node N X  will not be considered for any child node N  Y ere Y  X 002  a j and a j 005 a i Therefore miu  a i  SC  Y and miu  a i  can be removed from EstU  X and the transaction utility of each transaction containing a j  from TU X The pseudo code for this strategy is shown as follows 11 for each Tid R 013p  g  Y  do  12 remove  miu  a k  from  R TU X  T c  13 remove  miu  a k  SC  Y  from  EstU  X   Definition 19 The maximum item utility of an item a  is  denoted as mau  a defined as the value u  a  T r r which 015   T s  013p  D such that u  a  T s  u  a  T r  Definition 20 The maximum utility of an itemset  X  a 1   a 2  a K is defined as MAU  X  002   1  i K i a mau  SC  X  Lemma 4  015 X  X is low utility if MAU  X  min_utility  Proof The utility of an itemset X is the sum of the utility of its items in transactions containing X  MAU  X is the sum of the maximum item utility of each item multiplied by the number of transactions containing X Since the maximum item utility of each item represents the highest utility that an item can have MAU  X higher or equals to the utility of X  Strategy 5. Discarding Candidates with a MAU that is less than the minimum utility threshold \(DCM The last strategy is called DCM and is applied to line 3 of the CHUDPhaseI procedure. A candidate X C can be discarded from phase II if its estimated utility EstU  X C  MAU  X C s less than min_utility  Rationale Lemma 4 guarantees that an itemset X is not  a closed  HUI if MAU  X  min_utility The pseudo code for the strategy 5 is shown below 03  if  min  EstU  X C  MAU  X C  002  min_utility  then  C  Efficient Recovery of High Utility Itemsets In this subsection, we present a top-down method named DAHU  D erive A ll High Utility itemsets\or efficiently recovering all the HUIs. The pseudo code of DAHU is shown in Figure 7. It takes as input a min_utility threshold, a set of closed  HUIs HC and Kmax the maximum length of itemsets in HC DAHU outputs the complete set of high utility itemsets H  K i 1  002 H K respecting min_utility where H K denotes the set of HUIs of length K To derive all HUIs DAHU proceeds as follows. First, the set H Kmax is initialized to HC Kmax where the notation HC K represents the set of K itemsets in HC During step 2 to step 14 in Figure 7, each set H K is constructed from K  Kmax  1  to K 1. In each iteration H KÖ1 is recovered by using HC K For each itemset X  a 1  a 2  a K in HC K if the utility of X is no less than min_utility the algorithm outputs the high utility itemset X  with its exact utility and then generates all K 1\subsets of X The latter are obtained by removing each item a i 013p  X  from X one at a time to obtain subsets of the form Y  X   a i   If Y is not present in H K or Y is present in H K with SC  X  SC  Y  Y is added to H KÖ1 its support count is set to the support count of X Property 4\i.e SC  Y  SC  X  and the utility of Y is set to the utility of X minus the i th value in V  X  u  Y  u  X  V  X  a i Property 6-8\.

Although CHUD and UPGrowth produce different results, both of them consist of two phases. In Phase I, CHUD and UPGrowth respectively generate candidates for CHUIs and HUIs. In Phase II, CHUD and UPGrowth respectively identify CHUIs and HUIs from candidates produced in their Phase I. The combination of CHUD and DAHU is denoted as CHUD+DAHU, which first applies CHUD to find all closed  high utility itemsets and then uses DAHU to derive all high utility itemsets from the set of closed  high utility itemsets generated by CHUD The process of CHUD+DAHU in phase I is the same as that of CHUD. In Phase II, CHUD+DAHU first identifies CHUIs from the set of candidates and then uses CHUIs to derive all HUIs. Experiments were performed on a desktop computer with an IntelÆ Core 2 Quad Processor @ 2.66 GHz running Windows XP and 2 GB of RAM. CHUD and DAHU were implemented in Java. The implementation of UPGrowth was obtained from Tseng et al whi ch is also implemented in Java. All memory measurements were done by using the Java API. Both synthetic and real datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. A synthetic dataset T12I8D200K was generated by the IBM data g  The par am eters of t h e d a t a g enerator are  described in Table III. Real datasets Mushroom and BMSWebView1 were obtained from FIMI Repository [3 Foodmart is a real dataset obtained from the Microsoft foodmart 2000 database. Except the Foodmart dataset, the external and internal utility of each item are generated with the settings used in [20  Fo o d m art al r eady con tain s uni t profits and purchase quantities of items. The total utility of Foodmart is 120,160.84. Table IV shows the characteristics of the above datasets. Mushroom  is a  real-life  dense dataset each transaction containing 23 items. Foodmart  is a real-life sparse dataset from a retail store, with real utility values BMSWebView1 is a real-life sparse dataset of click-stream data with a mix of short and long transactions \(up to 267 items\00K is a large sparse dataset with an average transaction length of 10 A  Experiments on Mushroom Dataset The first experiment consisted of running UPGrowth CHUD, and DAHU on the Mushroom  dataset, while varying min_utility from 10% to 1 %. The execution time of UPGrowth, CHUD, and CHUD+DAHU is shown in Figure 8 for Phase I and Phase II. Results show that CHUD outperforms UPGrowth for both phases, and the performance gap increased as min_utility was set lower. For example, when min_utility 1%, CHUD is 50 times faster than UPGrowth for Phase 1 and 63 times faster for Phase II Moreover, when CHUD is combined with DAHU to discover all high utility itemsets, the combination largely outperforms UPGrowth and was only slightly slower than CHUD. Table V shows the number of candidates and the number of results generated by UPGrowth, CHUD, and CHUD+DAHU. CHUD generates a much smaller number of candidates and results than UPGrowth. The smaller number of candidates generated by CHUD in Phase I is what makes CHUD perform better than UPGrowth in Phase II and for the total execution time \(because Phase II is more costly than Phase I [20  stly we m easured the redu cti on achieved by the representation of closed  high utility itemsets generated by CHUD compared to the set of all high utility itemsets generated by UPGrowth. As shown in Table V, a huge reduction is obtained \(up to 796 times\. Moreover by running DAHU, it is possible to recover all high utility itemsets B  Experiments on Foodmart Dataset The second experiment consists of running UPGrowth CHUD and DAHU on the Foodmart dataset, while varying min_utility from 0.10% to 0.005 % of the total utility in the database. Execution times for Phase I and Phase II are shown in Figure 9. The total execution time of UPGrowth is less than CHUD, initially. But as the min_utility threshold became smaller, CHUD becomes faster \(up to two times faster than UPGrowth\. The reason why the performance gap between CHUD and UPGrowth is smaller for Foodmart than for Mushroom is due to the fact that Foodmart is a sparse dataset. As a consequence the reduction achieved by mining closed  high utility itemsets is less \(still up to 34.6 times, as shown in Table VI

A similar phenomenon occurs in closed   HUI mining. Besides, when DAHU was combined with CHUD, the execution time of CHUD+DAHU was up to two times faster than UPGrowth for low minimum utility thresholds and slightly slower than CHUD C  Experiments on BMSWebView1 Dataset The third experiment consists of running UPGrowth CHUD and CHUD+DAHU on BMSWebView1  while varying min_utility from 10% to 1 % of the total utility of the database. Results are presented in Figure 10 and Table VII. UPGrowth runs faster than CHUD and CHUD+DAHU for min_utility 003 3%. However, for min_utility 3%, the performance of UPGrowth decreases sharply. For min_utility 2%, UPGrowth cannot terminate within the time limit of 100,000 seconds and it generates more than 1,000,000 candidates in Phase I, whereas CHUD terminates in 80 seconds and produces only seven closed  HUIs from 32 candidates. The reason why CHUD performs so well is that it achieves a massive reduction in the number of candidates by only generating a few long itemsets containing up to 149 items, while UPGrowth has to consider a huge amount of redundant subsets \(for a closed itemset of 149 items, there can be up to 2 149 2 non-empty proper subsets that are redundant\. DAHU also suffers from the fact that there are too many HUIs. It runs out of memory for min_utility 2 % when trying to recover all HUIs because it has to generate too many subsets D  Experiments on Sythetic Dataset The fourth experiment is to run the algorithms on T12I8D200K  with min_utility varying from 0.1% to 0.02 of the database total utility. Results are presented in Figure 11 and Table VIII. For this dataset, CHUD is faster than UPGrowth for the total execution time. Although the reduction on this synthetic dataset is not as good \(since it produced the same result as UPGrowth\, CHUD is faster because it generates about three times less candidates in Phase I. CHUD takes more times to generate candidates in Phase I. But the total execution time of CHUD is less than UPGrowth because Phase II is more costly than Phase I CHUD+DAHU also outperforms UPGrowth, since DAHU only spend one second to derive all HUIs E  Memory Usage During the previous experiments, we also measure the maximum memory usage of UPGrowth and CHUD. Results for Mushroom  and Foodmart  are presented in Figure 12 and are similar for the other datasets. In general, CHUD uses as much or slightly more memory than UPGrowth because the latter uses a compact tries-based data structure for representing the database that is more memory efficient than a vertical database. However, when the databases contain very long HUIs such as BMSWebView1, the number of candidates can be very large. In this case, the memory consumption of UPGrowth rises dramatically because it needs to create a number of conditional UPTrees that is proportional to the number of candidates

Three effective strategies named REG  RML and DCM were further proposed to enhance the performance of CHUD. To efficiently recover all high utility itemsets from this representation, we proposed a top-down method named DAHU. Real and synthetic datasets with varied characteristics were used to perform a thorough performance evaluation. Results show that the proposed representation achieves a massive reduction in the number of high utility itemsets \(e.g. a reduction of up to 800 times for Mushroom and 32 times for Foodmart datasets\Besides, CHUD outperforms UPGrowth, the current best algorithm by several orders of magnitude under low minimum utility thresholds \(e.g CHUD terminates in 80 seconds on BMSWebView1 for min_utility 2%, while UPGrowth cannot terminate within 24 hours\e combination of CHUD and DAHU is also faster than UPGrowth when DAHU could be applied A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  This research was supported by National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C under grant no.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
