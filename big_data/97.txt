1603-1 Nagaoka, Niigata 940-21 Japan Abstract In this study we shall show an association process of synergetic neural networks The present association model is based on a top down formulation of the dynamic rule of analogue neural network It is found that a complete association can be accomplished 
up to the same number of the embedded patterns as the number of neurons In practice an association process is simulated for the practical images with 256 gray scale levels and 256x256 size In addition searching process of the embedded patterns is also realized by means of controlling the 
attraction parameters Finally a stochastic model for the dynamic process is also proposed for the association and the searching of the embedded patterns 81 INTRODUCTION Recently the associative model based on the autocorrelation characteristics halve been extensively investigated Since the pioneering works by Anderson 11 
Kohonen[2 and Nakano[3 many researchers have theoretically analyzed such an association model of connected neurons with a certain autocorrelation matrix[4-16 Up to date, however it has been reported that the capacity of the autocorrelation associative model is not so large and at most 0.15N where N 
is the number of neurons[l-61 This is considered to be as the result of the many spurious memory states increasing exponentially with N In addition as is well known nowadays the performance is usually depressed especially for the strongly correlated  or non orthogonal 
embedded patterns M In this work let us propose a new association model, which is available for MsN on the basis of the synergetics[7-91 In the present model a complete association of an embedded patter can be accomplished in the order parameter space[9 Here a stochastic 
process is involved for the control of the attraction parameters Controlling a threshold of the switching of the attraction parameters in a stochastic manner it is found that the present model can be continuously changed between an and a searching model in the order parameter space associative model 2367 


52 DYNAMICS OF SYNERGETIC ASSOCIATIVE MODEL In the present model the internal states and the output of the i th neuron parameter are denoted as q and p lsi sN respectively Denoting the embedded vectors as v 1s-rs-M lsisN the discrete time and the analogue neuron model is assumed q i n+l i n l-k i n 7 where k is a constant between0 and 1 h 221I is called the attraction parameter and the symbol    stands for the innerproduct as N a,b>=x a ib  3 i 1 The state of the i th neuron q of the embedded pattern vectors v 221 lsr sMj 1sisN as follows can be expressed in terms of the linear combination M q n E 221 n 2211 i+rl i\(n  49 r=l where q n is the residual error or noise due to the incompleteness of the vector set v r  and v 221H is the adjoint vector of v-\(\221 and defined as M 5 f  v  2211 i=Ca v i r\221=l here a  is given by a rr  v 2211 iv 2211 i 1  6 i-1 To assure the existence of a nl MsN has to be assumed Then q i\(n can be expanded as N-M q i\(n  221 n 2211 i r=l Here the vector set U and U 221lt have to satisfy the followings 2368 7

Function 4 can be used to evaluate the search ratio for each matching rule since the number of instances is known at the time of rule generation In the following section we give some examples to illustrate how the method works in practice using a model database 221DEPARTMENT\222 Rule No W  Z WinsnunJZinsnum R1 Dcode=\221ACCT\222+Dname=\221Accounting\222 130 FO  3 Examples of the Optimisation Method Our examples are based on a model 221DEPARTMENT\222 relation which has 240 instances and 5 different attributes Dcode char\(41 Dname char 12 Project integer Manager char\(4 Location char 15 and assumes initially that the system has 8 rules in the rules set These rules are shown in Table 2 with their associated number of instances within the 221DEPARTMENT\222 relation 221Project\222 is an indexed attribute of the relation Row length is 40 bytes and a disk block can hold 12 tuples Total disk blocks B  20 2:Dcode=\221ACCT\222 Manager  221AI\222 130 180 3:Dname  221Marketine\2224\222roiect  7 I40 I60 I IR8:Project>7+Location= \221London\222 160 1150 I Example 1 Assume that we are _looking for all information in the 221DEPARTMENT\222 relation where Dcode  221ACCT\222 This query can be represented in SQL as  Q1 select  from DEPARTMENT where Dcode  221ACCT\222 In our system we match the single query condition against antecedent conditions in our rules set From Table 2 two rules below can be used to transform the given query R1 Dcode=\221ACCT\222+Dname=\221Accounting\222 130 bo R2 Dcode=\221ACCT\222 Manager=\221Al\222 130 180 There is no rule to cause refutation of the given query and the answer of the query can not be found using matching rules alone so the optimiser enters a loop to calculate costs of both the antecedent condition and the consequent condition for each associated rule and then ranks them For R1 the antecedent condition is W1 the length of the comparison value of the condition is Wlength  4 the number of instances identified by W1 is Winsnum  30 and the condition does not contain any indexed attributes thus Windex  0 The consequent condition is Z1 Zlength  10 Zinsnum  40 and Zindex  0 The optimiser then proceeds to the cost estimation process as follows a Function 1 is used to compute approximately how many disk blocks need to be retrieved for the antecedent condition R 30 A  B*\(l--\(l-l/B  20  1  1  11 20  15.70 b\Since the antecedent attribute is not indexed we determine the expected number of disk blocks which need to be searched to retrieve the A blocks using Function 2 A  B  1 15.70  20  1 E 19.74 I  C  A+l 15.70  1 c Using Function 3a the number of tuples can be found as follows Number-of-tuples E C  N I 19.74  12 I 236.91 d Using Function 4 the number of bytes to be compared for the condition Wcost  Number-of-tuples  Length  236.91  4  947.66 For the consequent condition the calculation is similar Using Function 1 the approximate number of blocks retrieved can be found R 40 A B*\(l-\(l-l/B  i 20  1  1  1  20  17.42 Since the consequent attribute is not indexed we determine the expected number of disk blocks to be searched using Function 2 A  B  1 C  A+l 17.42  20  1 E 19.86   17.42  I The number of the tuples is found as follows 323 


Number-of-tuples E C  N z 19.86  12 I 238.326 We then estimate the number of bytes to be compared for the condition Zcost  Number-of-tuples  Length  238.326  10  2383.26 The cost of the antecedent condition of the rule is less than the cost of the consequent condition of the rule so the rule is added into Y For rule R2 Wcost and Zcost can be found in a similar way to the first rule; Wcost  947.66 Zcost  479.6. The cost of the antecedent condition of the rule is higher than the consequent of the rule so the rule is added into X Since a query condition is the antecedent condition of R2 whose consequent is Manager  221Al\222 this latter is added into the condition list. At this stage a check is made to eliminate any conditions in the list which can be matched with the consequents of rules in Y Using R1 in Y it is not possible to eliminate any rules in the list  The optimisation process is completed with the construction of the near optimum query as below Qo select  from DEPARTMENT where Manager  221Al\222 and Dcode  221ACCT\222 This resultant query is more efficient to execute than the original Example 2 Assume that we are looking for all information in the 221DEPARTMENT\222 relation where Dname  221Marketing\222 This query can be represented in SQL as  42 select  from DEPARTMENT where Dname=\222Marketing\222 Comparing the conditions of the given query the following matching rules can be found estimate the costs of both antecedents and consequents of the rules. These costs can be seen in the following table where the first row shows costs of antecedent conditions and the second row shows that of consequent conditions R3 R4, R5 and R7 are added into X R6 and R8 are added into Y We then order all rules in X according to their search ratios that is R3 R4 R7 and R5 The condition list is constructed taking the consequent conditions of the ordered group as 221Project  7\222 221Project  12 221Manager  221M3\224 and Dcode  221MKTG\222 Then the OC 221Dname  221Marketing\224 is added to the condition list because it does not exist in X as a consequent condition The optimiser then determines whether there are any rules in Y where the consequent condition of the rule is in the condition list Using R6 it is possible to eliminate the condition 221Dname  221Marketing\224 from the condition list knowing the antecedent condition of the rule is less expensive than the consequent condition and already exists in the list Finally the near optimum query can be constructed as Qo select  from DEPARTMENT where Project  7 and Project  12 and Manager  221M3\222 and Dcode  221MKTG\222 It is possible to see from the given examples that our method is straight forward to apply even where there is a large number of matching rules In our system the optimiser selects the most restrictive rules in order to construct the near optimum query We also minimise the overall effort required since it is not necessary to construct all alternative queries Our experimental results in the following section show that the method is viable 4 Computational Results R3:Dname=\221Marketing\222-+Projecb7 140 I 60 R4:Dname 221Marketin&+Proiect 12 140 I 200 Y RS:Dname=\221Marketing\222+Dcode=\221MKTG\222 I 40 I 40 R6:Dcode=\221MKTG\222+Dname=\221Marketing\222 140 I 40 R7:Dname=\221Marketing\222-+Manager=\221M3\222 I 40 I 100 R8:Project>7 Location=\221London\222 160 I 150 It may be seen that no rule causes a refutation of the given query or may be used to find the answer to the query As mentioned before, the optimiser enters a loop to The two relations in our database were a 5861 instance relation 221STUDENT\222 provided by the Student Administration Office at Essex University and a 27266 instance relation 221HOUSEHOLD\222 which was created from the 221General Household Survey Data, GN: 33124 Study number 3170 Year 1993-1994\222 Survey data was provided by the ESRC Data Archive at the University The row length was 43 bytes for 221STUDENT\222 and 71 bytes for 221HOUSEHOLD\222 The total number of blocks was 248 for 221STUDENT\222 and 6139 for 221HOUSEHOLD\222 324

of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database

Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e

question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een

researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e

primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or

These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in
