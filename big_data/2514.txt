There are various types of\ndata in genomics research, most of which are stored as plain\ntext tables. A data compression framework tailored to this\n?le type is introduced in this paper, featuring a combination\nof generic compression algorithms, GPU acceleration, and\ncolumn-major storage. This approach is the ?rst to achieve\nboth compression and decompression rates of around 100MB/s\non commodity hardware without compromising compression\nratio. By selecting appropriate compression schemes for each\ncolumn of data, this framework ef?ciently exploits data re-\ndundancy while remaining applicable to a wide range of\nformats. The GPU-accelerated implementation also properly\nexploits the parallelism of compression algorithms. Finally,\nthis paper presents a novel ?rst-order Markov model based\ntransformation, with evidence that it is at least as effective as\nBurrows-Wheeler and Move-To-Front in some contexts.\nKeywords-big data; GPU; data compression parallel algo-\nrithm; Markov model.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technologies have made\ngenomic analysis practical for both clinical applications and\n“big data”-driven basic science. Exponential growth of se-\nquencing bandwidth has been reported in previous literatures\n[1]; as an example of the current scale, in BGI-Shenzhen, the\nlargest sequencing center in the world, total storage capacity\nis around 20PB, and tens of TB of raw sequence data are\ngenerated per day. Due to the wide variety of computational\ntools, analysis pipelines and ?eld applications, these data are\nstored in many different formats and mined in many different\nways, further complicating the challenge of handling the\nworkload in an ef?cient and reliable manner.\nIn this variety, however, there are recurrent features. One\nof the most prominent is an imbalance between compute and\ndata access–applications tend to be I/O-bound. As a result,\nsome forms of data compression are usually warranted.\n+These authors contribute equally to the work\n#Corresponding author\nCompression also facilitates storage and transfer of large\nvolume of data, by using only a small proportion of storage\nspace and transfer time.\nCompression of genomics data is about seeking redun-\ndancy in various objects, say, raw reads, quality values,\nalignment results, etc. Existing studies proposed algorithms\nbased on searching for exact repeats [2], various approximate\nmatching methods [3], as well as statistical model based\nmethods. Most of these works do not perform well in terms\nof compression / decompression bandwidth. The reason is\nthat compression algorithms often feature high computation\ncomplexity to explore the informatics redundancy for better\ncompression ratio. More than that, generic algorithms have\nalways been competing for the balance between compression\nratio and compression / decompression bandwidth. While\ncompression methods dedicated to genomics data are inap-\nplicable to general data, on the other hand, generic compres-\nsion tools fail to exploit the characteristics of genomics data\nfor better performance. Dozens of algorithms are designed\nsolely for compressing FASTQ ?le [4], which is the standard\nto keep and retrieve raw sequences.\nWith emerging trend of employing hardware accelerators\nin diverse scienti?c computing ?elds, including genomics\nresearch [5 attempts are also made to adopt the accel-\nerators to speedup data compression algorithms. Most of\nthese works are implemented on GPU for its wide accep-\ntance. However, due to computation complexity and data\ndependency in generic algorithms, they did not perform\nwell in both compression ratio and bandwidth. For exam-\nple CULZSS [6], an implementation of Lempel-Ziv-Storer-\nSzymanski \(LZSS ratio\nis not comparable with other CPU-based methods. Further-\nmore, Patel et al. made attempt to accelerate bzip2-like\ncompression on GPU [7], but not able to obtain expected\nperformance. On the other hand domain-speci?c compres-\nsion using GPU acceleration is also studied in several papers,\nsuch as ?oating-point data [8] and database [9].\nTo address the storage and transfer issues in genomics and\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 181\nbioinformatics, we develop a data compression framework,\nfeaturing a combination of generic compression algorithms,\nGPU acceleration, and column major storage. In this work,\ndistinct features of genomics data, which provide opportu-\nnity for ef?cient compression, are identi?ed and lead to two\nmajor contributions.\na employing\ncolumn-major strategy is presented, which applies appro-\npriate compression schemes to different columns. This\nimproves compression ratio by divide the entire genomics\ndata ?le into columns with similar characteristics, thus\noutperforms the approach treating entire dataset or ?le as\na whole. Furthermore, a simple yet effective approach is\nused to determine the best combination of compression\nalgorithms against each 


column.\nb BWT MTF cod-\ning, as well as proposed novel Markov model based\nalgorithm, are studied to ?gure out as much as their\ninherent parallelism. Then GPU accelerated version of\nthese algorithms are carefully designed and implemented,\nsigni?cant speedup is observed. This helps tackle the\nintensive computation in compression, thus improve com-\npression / decompression rate.\nCombining column-major strategy and GPU accelerated\ncompression our framework achieves speedup of an order of\nmagnitude comparing with CPU-based bzip2 and gzip. In the\nfollowing Section II, the overall design of the compression\nframework as well as the design and implementation of\ncompression algorithms on GPU are presented. The corre-\nsponding experimental results are given in Section III. The\nSection IV concludes this work.\nII. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe GPU-accelerated compression framework for ge-\nnomics data consists of three parts: the group of optimized\ncompression algorithms, the compression schemes selection\nmodule, and the column-major compression module. Fig.1\nshows the work?ow of the framework, in which the ?les\nwill be read and compressed by multiple rounds. In each\nround, the column-major compression module will transform\nthe data from row-major to column-major and then use\nthe best combination of compression schemes selected by\nthe compression schemes selection module to compress and\nstore the data.\nA. Column-Major Compression Strategy\nThe investigation of various formats of genomics data,\nincluding standard formats FASTA and FASTQ and other\ncustomized ?le formats like SAM and VCF shows two\ncommon characteristics of genomics data. First, the data\nis organized in a 2-D table view employing row-major\nstorage. Second, following the table view, data in the same\nInput file Output file\nOptimized compression \nalgorithms\nCompression schemes\n\(Combination of algorithms processing\nCompress each column\nColumn-major compression engine\nConvert to column-major\nTest and apply the best scheme \nagainst each column\nBlock #i\nGPU-accelerated compression framework\nFigure 1.

Example of a FASTQ ?le containing two sequences.\ncolumn share the same feature, which motivates that special\noptimization can be adopted for a speci?c column.\nTaking the FASTQ format for example, Fig.2 presents a\nfew lines of FASTQ ?le including two sequences. Each four\nlines are for one DNA sequence. Speci?cally, the ?rst line\nbegins with a character which is followed by a sequence\nidenti?er. The second line contains sequence bases \(A, T, C,\nand G line is a single character + and optionally\nfollowed by the same sequence identi?er. The fourth line is\nan encoded sequencing quality score string. Each four lines\ncan be treated as a row, within which there are four elds\ncorresponding to four columns. Furthermore, data in each\n?eld share the same feature, such as the nucleotide base\n?eld having only four bases \(A, T, C and G compression\nmethod to each column of data, a column-major compres-\nsion strategy is designed to fully exploit the advantageous\nsynthetical effects .\nB. Compression Schemes Selection\nFour major schemes are used for column-major compres-\nsion on genomics data formats.\na for data with many similar strings. Columns with\nthis feature exist in genomics data formats, such as the\nsequence identi?er and the chromosome name in the\n182\nsequence alignment data. We use gzip, which implements\nLZ77 with Huffman coding, to compress this featured\ndata.\nb number of distinct\ncharacters, the frequency-based method Huffman coding\nusually provides effective solution Such featured columns\ninclude the nucleotide bases in the sequence data, the\nnumber of mismatches in the sequence alignment data,\nand quite a few columns in the SNP detection result data\n[10].\nc included in many genomics data\nsets, which re?ect the quality of sequencing. Analysis\nand study on compressing this data are common in recent\nyears [11]. A new compression method called Markov\ntransform is developed and compared with the method\nof BWT followed by MTF in performance. Experiments\nshow that Markov transform has better compression per-\nformance with equally good compression ratios.\nd comprehensive com-\npression method tends to be more effective. A scheme\ncomposed of BWT, MTF and Huffman coding, which is\nsimilar to bzip2, can handle them.\nThe above four schemes re?ect three general cate-\ngories in compression, namely transformation-based com-\npression methods, substitution-based compression methods\nand statistical-model-based compression methods.\nAn auto-tuning approach selects these proper schemes\nthrough the following way in the column-major compres-\nsion.An input ?le will be processed in multiple rounds. In\nthe ?rst one, the framework applies all four schemes on\neach column of data. From this sample and test process,\nthe compression scheme that ?ts each column most will\nbe selected. Then the compressed columns with the 


best\ncompression results are stored for the ?rst round, and the\nbest compression schemes are applied in the following\nrounds.\nC. Design and Implementation of Compression Algorithms\non GPU\nThough there are an abundance of research and de-\nvelopment on text data compression, the performances of\nthese algorithms critically limit their application on practical\nproblems. While the popularity of hardware accelerators\nprovides opportunities to improve the situation, current work\non this area is far from suf?cient and satisfying. In this work,\nmuch attention is paid to mining and re?ning the parallelism\nof various compression algorithms, utilizing the GPU SIMT\n\(Single Instruction Multiple Thread implementations of the\nmajor compression algorithms in the framework on GPU.\n1 Burrows Wheeler Transform characters in the context. It uses rotation\nand lexicographical sorting to discover the intrinsic redun-\ndancy of text data. The naive BWT does not exploit the\nrelation among rotated strings and ends up in a relatively\nhigh computation complexity. In order to improve the per-\nformance of this algorithm, the BWT string is indirectly\nbuild via constructing the suf?x array [12], which improves\nthe parallelism of BWT building process.\nSuf?x array construction has long been studied, but there\nare few successful cases to implement it on GPU. In this\nwork, the pre?x doubling algorithm proposed by Sun et al.\n[13] is used to construct the suf?x array. This implementa-\ntion achieves as good performance as the work of Deo and\nKeey 14], which is known as the best-ever implementation\nof suf?x array construction using the skew algorithm.\nIn the pre?x doubling algorithm, sorting the integer\nrank values corresponding to suf?x array values consumes\nmost of the computation time. The GPU-accelerated integer\nsorting libraries B40C [15] is selected because of its best\nperformance. Additionally, B40C provides the ?exibility to\nchoose the bit length of keys for sorting, which makes\nit possible to further optimize the implementation of the\nalgorithm.To optimize the reverse of BWT, a direct and\n?exible method performs the intrinsically serial process in\nparallel.\nIn this method, stable sorting is ?rst applied on the\ncharacters of BWT string to get an auxiliary string composed\nof the successor of each character. Then the reverse process\ncan be paralleled with numbers of threads from multiple\npositions of the BWT string. This combination fully releases\nGPU power on parallel computation.\n2 Move to Front Transform \(MTF character transformation. It is used to\nimprove the effectiveness of entropy encoding algorithms by\nreordering the characters in a transformational table to re-\nduce the coding value of the current character with its index\nin the table. Hence the frequently occurred characters tend\nto be encoded with small index values. Since this algorithm\nand its reverse are serial in nature, data parallel schemes on\nGPU can accelerate them by just splitting the data to each\nthread and applying MTF or its reverse to the assigned data.\nThis inevitably in?uences the compression ratio a bit but it\nconsiderably improves the speed of processing.\n3 Coding\nHuffman coding is a popular entropy coding method\nwith optimal pre?x codes. Because Huffman encoding uses\nvariable-length codeword for each character, the decoding\nprocess is naturally serial bits by bits. To improve the\nparallelism of the decoding algorithm, we use the single-\nside growing Huffman tree to encode the characters [16].\nThis encoding algorithm results in an ef?cient memory usage\nin the Huffman decoding process Moreover, it provides the\ndetermined relation between the bit length and the codeword,\nwhich gives the possibility to decode each character in\n183\nparallel. Thereby an ef?cient parallel Huffman decoding\nmethod is implemented, which has never been done by\nprevious work.\nThe Huffman tree is build based on the character frequen-\ncies, thus getting the code length and codeword for each\ncharacter. After that, the output position of each character\ncan be calculated in parallel with pre?x sum, then characters\nare encoded in parallel. To avoid access con?ict when\ndifferent threads simultaneously output coding results, we\nuse the atomic operations on GPU to output the codes.\nIn parallel decoding, based on the generated character ta-\nble and skip table as well as the stored auxiliary code length\ntable, Huffman decoding of each character can be processed\nwith d threads at the same time, where d represents the depth\nof the Huffman tree.\n4 Reverse\nMarkov model used in compression is a preprocess that\ngenerates the conditional probability of current character in\nthe context of previous k characters, where k represents\nthe order of the model. Thus the following arithmetic or\nHuffman coding can take advantages of the predicted prob-\nabilities to produce more ef?cient codewords [17]. However,\ndue to the complexity of the dynamic high-order Markov-\nmodel-based compression method, the practical application\nis restricted by the compression and decompression rates. On\nthe other hand, the combination of BWT and MTF transform\ncan also improve the ef?ciency of the subsequent Huffman\ncoding, but this method also suffers from low compression\nrate.\nTo balance the compression ratio and rate, we propose a\nnew character transformation method called Markov trans-\nform based on the idea of Markov model. It combines a\n?rst-order static Markov model with sorting-based trans-\nformation, which can be well 


parallelized on GPU. This\nlight-weight method works well especially for some random-\ndistributed data sets being a useful replacement for complex\ncompression algorithms.\nThe Markov transform mainly consists of three steps.\nThe ?rst step is to construct the Markov model. Sup-\npose the character set is X = {x1, x2 xn}, then it\ncounts the frequency of occurrences for each character pairs\nx1x2\(1 ? i ? n, 1 ? j ? n C\(xixj can be estimated as P \(xj |xi xixj xi xi xixj xixj conditional probability in the context\nof xi. Second, a two-dimensional lookup table is builded\nusing the frequencies counted from the ?rst step. For each xi\ncorresponding to the ?rst dimension of the table, its elements\nx1, . . . , xn is sorted with the frequencies of C\(xixj appear after xi gets a\nsmaller order value. Third, each characters is encoded with\ntheir order values.\nTo implement the Markov transform on GPU, the ?rst step\nTable I\nTHE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE TEST PLATFORMS.\nPlatform Platform 1 Platform 2\nOperating System SUSE Linux Enterprise\nServer 11 SP1\nCentOS release 6.4\nCPU Intel\(R R R R 3GB\nNVIDIA Tesla K20c\n/ 5GB\nCUDA version 4.0 5.0\n*the performance data on CPU comes from this platform\nis parallelized using one GPU thread to count the frequency\nof several character pairs. To avoid access con?icts an\natomic operation \(atomicAdd sorted by\na block of threads using bitonic sorting network, and the\nsorting of each row is independent. For the ?nal step, one\nGPU thread is used to encode several characters in parallel.\nThe reverse of Markov transform uses the same lookup\ntable to restore the characters. It is implemented on CPU\nserially because the restore of each character depends on\nthe previous restored ones. But the CPU implementation also\nhas a very good performance since the reverse only uses the\nindices to directly restore the characters.\nIII EVALUATION\nOur compression framework uses GPU to accelerate dif-\nferent compression algorithms, and then adopts the column-\nmajor method to apply suitable compression scheme against\neach column, achieving an overall compression perfor-\nmance improvement. The performance results of the opti-\nmized compression algorithms and column-major compres-\nsion method are presented separately as follows.Finally we\ncompare the performance of our compression framework\nwith other existing compression methods.\nA. Test platform\nThe performance testing has been performed on two dif-\nferent hardware platforms. Table I shows the con?gurations\nof the two platforms.\nB. Performance of GPU Accelerated Algorithms\nThese algorithms are implemented on GPU using CUDA,\nand their performance are tested separately against their CPU\ncounterparts. All the tests are based on FASTQ ?les with\nsizes ranging from 1MB to 64MB as inputs. By testing the\nrespective performance of each data size, the best one is\nselected as the ?xed size to be processed on GPU each\ntime. We compare the performance of each algorithm on\nXeon E5630 and K20c. Table II is the speedup of different\nalgorithms achieved on GPU using 64MB data, showing\nthat implementation on GPU achieves good acceleration.\nIn particular, the BWT reverse on GPU obtains a speedup\n184\nTable II\nTHE SPEEDUP OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS ACHIEVED ON\nGPU.\nAlgorithms Transform Reverse Transform\nBWT 4x 31x\nMTF 8x 8x\nMarkov 18x N/A\nHuffman 2x 5x\nof 31x compared with its CPU-based version, and Markov\ntransform also has a speedup of 18x. These performance\nimprovements are owing to our re?nement of the parallelism\nin BWT reverse and the intrinsic parallelism of the new\ndesigned Markov transform, making them suitable to be\nimplemented on GPU with great performance gains.\nThe above results suggest that with the performance\nof all the algorithms improved effectively on GPU, the\noverall performance of the compression framework can be\nconsequently well improved.\nC. Performance of Column-Major Compression Method\nIn this section, two kinds of most popular genomics data\nformats are used to evaluate our compression framework.\nThe test data include a 7.2GB FASTQ ?le and a 7.6GB\nSAM ?le. The experiments compare the performance of\nusing one compression method to compress the whole ?le\nand the performance of using column-major compression\nmethod in our framework to compress the ?le.\nFig.3 shows the performance of different compression\nmethod on FASTQ ?le and SAM ?le. Except bzip2 and\ngzip, all the algorithms are accelerated by GPU The testing\nof these two ?les shows that this compression framework\ngains both good compression ratio and high compres-\nsion/decompression rate. For the compression ratio, it is on\nthe same level of bzip2 which commonly gives the best\ncompression ratio. For the compression rate, it has a 10\nfold speedup against bzip2, as well as a 5 fold gains of\ndecompression rate.\nExperiments also reveal the fact that compression methods\nwith the best compression ratios always have lower com-\npression and decompression rates. To tackle this imbalance\nbetween compression rate and ratio, our framework selects\nthe compression method that can well compromise on com-\npression rate and ratio with a relatively optimal achievement\nfor each column data. On the basis of it the column-major\ncompression method secures the best performance.\nOn the other hand, the Markov+Huffman compression\nmethod is superior to the BWT+MTF+Huffman method on\ncompression rate. Although the compression 


ratio is not\nideal for the whole ?le, it works best in compressing the\nsequence quality scores. Table III shows that commonly-\nused compression methods achieve a best compression ratio\nof 38.47%, but its corresponding compression rate is as low\nTable III\nTHE COMPRESSION OF THE SEQUENCE QUALITY VALUES.\nCompression\nMethod\nCompression\nRatio MB/s MB/s M2050 K20c\nbzip2\(CPU CPU 75.18\nMarkov+\nHuffman\n42.01 97.75 176.65 83.67 88.10\nHuffman 49.42 185.32 231.16 121.66 129.28\nTable IV\nTHE PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF GPU COMPRESSION\nFRAMEWORK AND OTHER SPECIFIC COMPRESSION\nMETHODS.\nCompression\nMethod\nCompression\nRate\(MB/s MB/s  zip 12.2 45.4 35.35\nbzip2 7.0 13.0 29.05\nSCALCE 7.8 13.1 25.72\nDSRC 13.5 32.2 24.77\nquip 8.3 10.9 22.19\nfasqz 4.6 3.8 21.95\nfqzcomp 8.2 8.3 21.72\nSeqsqueeze1 0.6 0.6 21.87\nThis work 111.0 104.4 29.46\nas 8.93MB/s, while the Markov+Huffman method gives a 10\nfold improvement with a bit of loss in compression ratio.\nD. Performance Comparison to Other Compression Method\nTo compare the performance of the compression frame-\nwork with other compression methods, the FASTQ ?le on\nthe previous research [18] is used as test data. Table VI\nshows the results of the performance comparison, which sug-\ngests that by applying different GPU-accelerated algorithms\nto their best-matched column data, the framework has an\nabsolute advantage in compression and decompression rates\nover those speci?c compression methods, though suffering a\nloss in compression ratio. The compression and decompres-\nsion rates of it both reach 100MB/s. By contrast, the fastest\ncompression rate of other speci?c methods represented in\n[18] is only 13.5MB/s. Besides, the algorithms in our\nframework are generic, which means they maintain much\nbetter adaption and generality compared to those speci?c\ncompression methods. All in all, our compression framework\nhas a good balance on compression rate and ratio as a whole.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, a novel adaptive compression framework\nwith the GPU acceleration for genomics data is introduced.\nThis compression framework is constructed on the basis of\ngeneric algorithms to be ?exible and extensible for new ?le\n185\nbz\nip2\n \(C\nPU\n n\(C\nPU\n w\nork\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n / \nD\nec\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n R\nat\ne \n\(M\nB\n/s\n Decompression Rate\n Compression Ratio\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n R\nat\nio\n \(%\n C\nPU\n C\nPU\n w\nork\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n / \nD\nec\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n R\nat\ne \n\(M\nB\n/s\n Decompression Rate\n Compression Ratio\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\n R\nat\nio\n \(%\n 3. Performance of compressing FASTQ \(left right compression schemes\nare proposed in the framework to have good compression\nrates and ratios for genomics data and three of them are\ndelicately re?ned in their parallelism for the acceleration of\ncompression rates on GPU By fully exploiting the character-\nistics of the genomics data, the column-major compression\nmethod is applied to improve the ef?ciency to achieve a\nbalance between compression/decompression rate and com-\npression ratio Moreover, a simple yet effective Auto-Tuning\nmethod is used to ?nd the best compression scheme for\neach column data in that ?le format.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future. In the \nevent that the presence of accelerated aging is identified, \nindicating that mental illness will occur, changes to the \nenvironment to the environment can be made to prevent \nmental illness from occurring. \nTable 3 includes 3 5  measurements are from the circadian \nand ultranian rhythms including the value for the least \nsignificant bit \(LSB into telemetry in the CCSDS format and the \nexpected extreme range that the measurement will need to \nmeasure across and not be exceeded. The LSB value is \nimportant because it defines the smallest increment n\(resolution e.g. knowledge the \nmeasurement. The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
