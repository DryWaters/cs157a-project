of the Theory of Constraints by Goldratt to iteratively improve the process of maintaining a fleet of aircraft The idea is to treat support as a process rather than doing the typical analysis and focus on improving the individual elements of the process without considering the effects on the process as a whole The approach described is iterative and adaptive to address the nature of a complex support system The Theory of Constraints is widely used as an 
analysis method to improve manufacturing processes The paper recasts fleet support as a process where throughput is fleet readiness inventory is the aircraft support equipment spares and maintainers and work in progress is the current faults/degradation that needs attention Some results are given that were generated using a support process simulation tool based on a generic fleet of Advanced Air Mobility Aircraft1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION

of a manufacturing system as the simultaneous increase in throughput decrease of work in progress and decrease in inventory Simply put TOC says that throughput will generally be limited by one bottleneck or constraint Once the limiting constraint is found the process should be managed to increase 1 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1340 Version 4 Updated January 15 2008 throughput decrease work in 
progress and decrease inventory to create improvement Continuous improvement can then be realized by finding and addressing each successive bottleneck that is limiting throughput The objective of this paper is to report results on an investigation into the potential use of Goldratt's methods as a general framework for continuous improvement in fleet readiness Fleet readiness is dependent on a number of complex activities and technologies that occur in the operation of any significant 
fleet of vehicles These support system activities typically include  Effectiveness of operations maintenance and logistics planning and decision making  Transportation and stocking of spares  Quality of on-board and off-board diagnostic and prognostics the number of required inspections  Maintenance personnel training  Checkout/validation of repairs or vehicle status prior to use e.g takeoff  Repair of worn or faulty systems at the intermediate or depot 
level  Efficiency of maintenance and repair procedures The end to end process which produces fleet readiness is a much interconnected complex heterogeneous collection of activities This paper is a work in progress that is directed at creating an iterative adaptive process based on TOC to continuously improve fleet readiness The approach this study used to implementing the framework for continuous improvement consisted of the following 1 Create a process model 1 


Access Resources Replace or Repair Systeml 2 Identify potential bottlenecks that could occur in this process using field data and a fleet simulation tool 3 Identify and implement strategies to address these bottlenecks 4 Use a fleet simulation tool to baseline the operation's throughput work in progress and inventory 5 Iterate on the above to refine strategies and realize improvement The approach has to be adaptive in the sense that the process model and fleet simulation tool used to forecast the gain may have to be modified based on the strategy used to address a given bottleneck This paper focuses on establishing a proof of concept of the TOC method based upon using a generic fleet of advanced mobility aircraft as a baseline The Boeing System Health Operations Analysis Model SHOAM simulation tool is used to predict the impact of improvements that address the selected bottlenecks In the effort described bottlenecks and associated improvements are limited to those related to Integrated Vehicle Health Management IVHM at organizational or O level to facilitate maintenance tasks For example fault isolation time is addressed by improving diagnostic accuracy turn around time by fault forwarding and frequency of unanticipated maintenance by prognostics Results of these evaluations using SHOAM are included 2 PROCESS MODEL The activities related to maintaining fleet readiness were modeled as a process consisting of three major overlapping segments mission execution maintenance and validation of vehicle flight worthiness See Figure 1 The subtasks related to aircraft and fleet readiness within these segments include 1 determining aircraft health status i.e diagnose or prognose faults or degradations which includes onboard and ground-based analysis inspections and troubleshooting 2 planning and scheduling of aircraft operations maintenance and logistics actions based on fleet and individual aircraft health status 3 acquiring the resources to repair the aircraft 4 replacing components or repairing the aircraft and 5 validating the repair to ensure the aircraft's suitability to return to service Mission Execution Maintenance Validation Aircraft E Determine Health Satus Checkout Plan Operations Maintenance and P ermance i E Resouces Supprt Eqipmen/Tool Miss i Read  Aircr Improving fleet readiness thus the productivity of fleet depends on the efficient execution of these tasks for the vehicles in the fleet In this model we define throughput as readiness of the fleet given a fleet and a mission demand for the period under consideration Work-in-progress is the total number of identified active health events where a health event is a fault or system degradation that requires some action Inventory is defined as spare parts and materials fleet aircraft support equipment to troubleshoot and repair and maintenance personnel 3 IDENTIFICATION OF PROCESS BOTTLENECKS Bottlenecks are activities or conditions that constrain or limit process efficiency According to Goldratt one or at most two bottlenecks are constraining process productivity Finding this these bottlenecks and changing the process to eliminate them will increase throughput while reducing work in progress and inventory To establish our methodology in the initial phase of this work we choose to experiment with potential bottlenecks related to the quality and responsiveness of maintenance activities Typical maintenance bottlenecks that may limit fleet readiness and the corresponding approaches to eliminate or reduce the impact of these bottlenecks are provided in the following Turn Around Time and Reduced Aborts 1 Preflight checkout or scheduled inspections The automation of preflight checkout inspections or scheduled inspections can reduce checkout time and maintenance hours An option in this regard includes obviating the need for preflight or scheduled inspections through the use of prognostics The quality of automation/prognostics can be a factor in the avoidance of in-flight or preflight aborts 2 Excessive manual fault isolation or troubleshooting Improved diagnostic accuracy and ambiguity resolution can reduce or perhaps eliminate troubleshooting time 3 Unanticipated Maintenance Prognostics can prevent unanticipated tasks and help ensure availability of resources for tasks 4 Excessive Checkout Time Automation of system checkout after maintenance actions can eliminate manual tests or inspections thus reducing repair times Offboard Communication Trained Personal Materials/Spare Parts 2 Figure 1 Process Model Logistics Actions Health Componenta 


Effective Allocation of Assets Fault Forwarding Communication of health related data/information in-flight can give maintainers the ability to identify plan and initiate support actions during mission execution Health information predicted maintenance actions and resources and operational considerations are inputs to the real-time generation of response plans The effectiveness of these plans is a function of the quality of diagnostic or prognostic information e.g confidence or likelihood Resource Availability 1 Reduction in false alarms Reduction in O-Level False alarms can reduce the required inventory e.g aircraft spares support equipment and personnel as well as the downtime waiting for spares 2 Life Extension The life of critical systems can be extended based on increased knowledge or refinement of usage and system health assessments 3 Each of these areas has more or less impact on fleet operation depending on the specific concept of operations of the vehicle fleet 4 SHOAM SIMULATION SHOAM was used to generate and evaluate strategies to eliminate bottlenecks It was developed to analyze and demonstrate the operational impacts of IVHM solutions through simulation of fleet operations 2 SHOAM supports the creation of systems with specific reliability characteristics ages those systems by running them through realistic scenarios allowing failures to occur and performing maintenance Basic reliability maintainability and operational metrics such as sorties per day per aircraft are inputs The model runs two design solutions with varying levels of IVHM or maintenance aiding implementation and can incorporate multiple operational scenarios Results from the SHOAM model include system operational availability mission reliability maintenance utilization and waiting times for mission maintenance execution SHOAM can be quickly adapted to any usage concept and analysis need IVHM capabilities such as prognostics condition based maintenance diagnostic accuracy/ambiguity and service life management can be evaluated As shown in Figure 2 SHOAM provides simulation monitoring to compare two fleets A and B with different configurations for side by side comparison especially during a runtime setting One fleet can be configured as a baseline or both fleets can have configurations different from the baseline SHOAM enables the integration of operational and maintenance requirements into one decision support process that balances mission maintenance and health management requirements in the context of operational demands This will enable end users to improve operational performance reduce logistics footprints focus maintenance and logistics resources into opportunistic times and locations and improve overall capability of joint operational forces 5 THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS TOC To investigate the viability of Goldratt's TOC a process of continuous improvement will be demonstrated using the results of a system using fault forwarding diagnosis and prognosis features such as prediction horizon and extending component life through condition based maintenance rather than inspections TOC's principles will first be introduced and then described in terms of a production process This production process will then be transformed into typical mission operations concepts with areas in mission execution maintenance and validation Data that models a theoretical fleet platform will be used to validate the worthiness of these concepts TOC is a process of continuous improvement Rather than focusing on all the value added processes in a system Goldratt claims that every system has a bottleneck that decides the rate at which throughput can occur The key to continuous improvement is to recognize the bottleneck address or manage it and then repeat the process Central to TOC is the Law of the Minimum or Liebig's Law 3 Justus von Liebig is often called the godfather of fertilizer His model states that a plant will grow in the presence of all necessary nutrients But when a nutrient is missing or deficient the plant will cease to grow or grow poorly This model is expressed as an equation below dO  m I N P dt ki I k N'kp  P 3 


Typical Production System Next Figure 4 shows a flow diagram of a maintenance process using the manufacturing model in Figure 3 Faults are fixed and/or prevented by maintenance to make the platform mission capable In this example the maintenance system uses turn around times and time to obtain spares to measure the amount of work it takes to fix a platform The rate at which faults are transformed into a mission capable platform is measured by mission capable rate MCR and Partial MCR Supply and Support Equipment  Resources are required by the maintenance process to make the platform mission capable The levels of S&S E&R are measured by Maintenance Resources Aircraft Spares and Test Equipment Note all measurements should be done at general fault rates and at Forces Specific Rates These can be proportional to Sortie Rates Goal Simultaneously reduce Inventory and WIP while increasing Througput X  Turn around times I 4  Time Typical Platform Maintenance System In this system the bottleneck occurs in the Maintenance node which in this case determines the rate at which the aircraft is made mission capable again Therefore to increase Mission readiness i.e throughput one must increase the rate which work is done in maintenance However it is only considered improvement if the system is able to accomplish the goal by simultaneously reducing the amount of WIP and inventory There are several ways to manage a bottleneck efficiently One way is to prepare before the maintenance action occurs In The Goal this was described as preparing material in front of a manufacturing oven such that when the oven was done the time to reload it was minimized Another method described in The Goal was reducing the amount of work done on parts that failed quality inspection as the final product was being prepared for shipment In this case the plant manager utilized Quality Control spare time by having them inspect high likelihood of failure parts before they entered the manufacturing process thus only work was done on parts that had a low likelihood of causing product failure Combining these two examples if aircraft technology could forward the fault or health data upon which a decision support system could give a qualified recommended course of action then maintainers could prepare for maintenance actions while the aircraft was still in flight thus shortening the amount of maintenance turnaround time The recommended course of action may provide a confidence level to help the maintainer ascertain the quality of the information and thus allow him to prepare accordingly 4 to obtain spares Sorties Faults Qualify Flight Readiness  Sortie Rates  GBeneral Rates Maintenance  Mission Capable Rates  Force Equipment Supply  Support Equipment  Resources S&S E&R Figure 4 CDapable Rates l Mission Maintaied M1M111  Maintenance i Resources  Aircraft Spares li Test I N and P are nutrients that are required for growth 0 is the rate of growth and k's are constants So for example if the nutrient N is available at a dependant rate that is less then I or P then N is the bottleneck of the plant system and N determines the rate plant 0 can grow at This concept can be transferred to any system and shows that a bottleneck governs the rate at which any system can operate at In Goldratt's book 1 TOC is described using a production facility to show how improvement can be created in a system by recognizing the bottleneck then managing to the bottleneck The result is improvement in terms of the following definition Improvement is the simultaneous reduction in inventory and work-in-process and increase in throughput It is imperative to note that to Goldratt the reduction of inventory and work-in-process simultaneously occurs with the increase in throughput This is his criteria for improvement for any system 6 APPLICATION OF TOC TO FLEET READINESS The flow diagram of a manufacturing system shown in Figure 3 provides a top level process flow in which raw material is changed into a product In this example the manufacturer uses work-in-process as a measure of the amount of work it takes to make a product The rate at which raw material is transformed to a product is measured by throughput Inventory is required to make the product In this example we'll assume the bottleneck is in the manufacturing node noted by the Work-In-Process WIP label Demand Raw Material Work-in-Process Quality Throughput I Inventory Figure 3 Specific Rates MCR  Partial Mission Ak

Despite the shortcomings of this initial investigation which included the generic baseline lack of detail in the process model and process bottlenecks that were not systematically identified based on fleet data we were encouraged that the TOC method has promise as a method to continuously improve fleet readiness Future applications would be based on details from a specific aircraft fleet data as well as evaluations using the SHOAM simulations and include more detailed process model that would support systematic analysis of constraints or bottlenecks per Goldratt's TOC REFERENCES 1 Cox Jeff Goldratt Eliyahu M 1986 The Goal A Process of Ongoing Improvement Croton-on-Hudson NY North River Press ISBN 0-88427-061-0 2 Williams Zachary Benefits of IVHM An Analytical Approach Paper 1507 IEEE Big Sky Conference March 2006 of over 40 technical papers conference presentations and technical reports James Poblete is a Systems Engineer Support Analyst in Phantom Works at the Boeing Company His duties include enhancing and maintaining tools such as SHOAM that evaluate the IVHM alternatives impacts on platform fleet performances and life cycle costs and conducting concept of operations and cost benefit analyses of health management alternatives on select programs He joined the company first focusing on projects with discrete event simulation He holds BS degrees in Systems Science and Engineering and Biomedical Engineering and is completing the MS degree in Systems Science and Mathematics from Washington University in Saint Louis 3 Brock William H Justus von Liebig The Chemical Gatekeeper Cambridge University Press 1997 BIOGRAPHY Javier Cortez is a Phantom Works Systems Engineer for The Boeing Company in St Louis He has developed software for many Navy intermediate maintenance test stations and forward thinking logistics applications Currently he is participating in a system research project in the area of data management of Automated Identification Technology and Decision Support Systems Javier has a BSEE from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and a MBA from Washington University in St Louis Dr Kirby Keller is a Technical Fellow for the Boeing Company He has 33 years experience in the application of intelligent systems to air and space vehicles His current duties include Technical Lead for the Integrated Vehicle Health Management programs within the Support and Services Thrust of Boeing Phantom Works In this position he is the principal investigator and system designer for several internal research and development projects that are focused on developing a Boeing wide common architecture and best practices for IVHM He holds a PhD in Mathematics from Iowa State University and is the author 7 


used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
