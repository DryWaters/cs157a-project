INTRODUCTION With the development of technology, Omnidirectional locomotion is not restricted to wheeled vehicles. Spenneberg and Kirchner [1] developed omnidirectional locomotion on the robot with eight legs. Hengst et al. [2] described an approach to generate omnidirectional walking for the Sony ERS-110 Aibo dogs In the competition of humanoid robot, the flags adopted for objective recognition and location is based on color space HIT-2 humanoid robot uses PDA?Personal Digital Assistant as the image processor to reduce the burden of underlying data processing of robot. Image segmentation is mainly based on the principle of threshold segmentation algorithm. There is no color space alternative to choose to instead of other spaces for all color image segmentation. Therefore, right color space is need to chosen according to the features in robot soccer games In this paper, we design a system based on embedded vision for humanoid robot, and present an improved looking-up table algorithm for image recognition. Meanwhile motion of turning for robot is planned and smoothed. A trajectory of the next steps for robot is generated by the local 


planner and finally, according to the rules of sprint for humanoid robot in FIRA, a decision is made and experiments on real humanoid robot HIT-2 are shown RELATED WORK The potential market in the entertainment humanoid robot has been attracted by scholars. Many different types of humanoid robot have been developed. Among these studies motion planning from the starting point to reach the target point for an autonomous robot is always a challenging work Because humanoid robot with multiple degrees of freedom of its own properties often become very complex planning issues In the continuous process of research, there appeared a variety of different control methods. Setiawan et al. [3] realized online control of forward and backward walking by connecting motion patterns generated in advance. Kajita et al 4] realized generation of online walking pattern applying Three-Dimensional Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode to humanoid type robot DESIGN OF EMBEDDED VISION SYSTEM AND IMAGE RECOGNITION A. Structure of vision system The entire system adopts principle of hierarchical control 978-1-4244-7874-3/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE and gets the image by the single camera. The information of image is processed in the PDA \(Personal Digital Assistant and the decision system also running in the PDA will get the information and other feedback from sensors to call the motion system executing B. Recognition of the color space based on improved Look-up table As we known, using look-up table approach can further speed up the clustering speed. This approach adopts operation of array indexes instead of N4 times comparison operation which greatly improves the efficiency of computing for clustering algorithm. However, the disadvantage is its too much storage space. According to this problem, an algorithm based on improved look-up table is present to complete the color space clustering The use of projection transformation can project the pixels of image in the color space corresponding to the coordinates onto the three axes of color components respectively. Thus, the number of dimensions of clustering an 


array of look-up table reduced to one dimension. J kinds of color space can be expressed by three arrays of unsigned integers with j-th bit. \(HClass[0255], SClass[0255 IClass[0255 represent each value of color respectively. The j-th bit of elements in every array denotes the binarization results of the j-th color. The clustering of pixels is achieved through bitwise AND operation for arrays The nature of approach of improved look-up table present in this paper is based on the multi-threshold for color image segmentation. There are two advantages of this approach 1. By adopting j-th bit of unsigned integers to represent the elements of array, only two times for bitwise AND operation can determine the color category of pixels, which greatly increased the speed 2. By projecting three-dimensional color space onto a one-dimensional axis, only three one-dimensional arrays can express the color space and predefined color category, which greatly save the memory space MOTION PLANNING FOR HUMANOID ROBOT A. Motion planning for running The energy is assumed not stored in every joints and the energy cost function for moving can be defined as 0 0 T T E dt   where [ ] 11 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10, , , , , , , , , ?? = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? is the major torques during the motion of running and [ ] 11 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10, , , , , , , , ,? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?= is the angles of joints of the robot. Some angles described as bellow can be calculated according to the Fig.1 1 6 7 2 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 4 2  q q q q q q q q 


     Fig.1 picture of poses of humanoid robot during the process of running motion B. Smoothing for the complex gaits The connection of complex gaits is question worth studying. If the connection failed, the completely complex gaits may fail. To smooth the connection between two gaits suppose the i? as the degree of joint in time i , so the next degree of joint is 1i? + . If the i  is passed and the time 1i is coming, so the current degree of joint is 1i? + , and the next degree of joint is 2i? + . For the smoothly connecting from i? to 1i? + , we adopt the trigonometric function to time difference. Suppose the beginning time is iT  and the ending time is 1iT + , the transition angle from the following equations  1 sin 2 i i i i i i t Tt T T      1 And the angular velocity can be get by equation \(2  1 1 cos 2 i i i i i i i t Tt 


T T T T       2 Since the connection curve is smoothing C. Local motion planner Global scanning an unknown environment using vision will take considerable time, and motion planning for humanoid robot under unknown environment is a complex project. Therefore, we design a local motion planner, which can be defined as finding a feasible locomotion for the next n steps based on minimum of energy dissipation. We design some basic motions off-line including of forward one-step backward one-step, left one-step, right one-step, turn right and turn left. These motions, which stored in the motion library of robot are test on the flat floor and executed stably. The local motion planner can use these basic motions for planning the locomotion The local motion planner plans the local locomotion via the information of itself and captured by the vision system. A sequence can be gotten according to the trajectory. Let  number of motion, t represents the time needed to finish the motion, d is the distance from the projection of center of gravity of robot under the former pose to the next pose after finishing this motion, ? denotes the shifting angle between the former pose of robot to the next pose completed by this motion, and the e  means the energy consuming during this motion, which is test by the experiments. The planner can generate a feasible trajectory according to the principle of least energy consumption. The minimum energy consuming of sequence will be selected to execute. Since we select the basic motion in the library by random, the computational complexity will increase exponentially by the increase of basic motions. The local planner just plans the two or three steps next to robot in order to eliminate the time of 


computing When the robot executes the sequence of motions, the information gathered by the vision system and information gained by the tilt sensor can help the robot to adjust its location and keep stable D. Control decision for sprint According to the rule of competition held in FIRA, the decision for sprint of robot can be shown as in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 geometric graph of playing field for sprint game of humanoid robot As shown in Fig.2, the circle with white color represents the robot and during the sprint, its location can be different. L is the left part of the centerline of runway and R is the right Because of the symmetrical relationship, only the situation of robot in L is discussed. The green part is the safe region and when the robot is in the red part which means danger, because the robot may go outside of the runway if it adjusts its pose when it is in the red part. The yellow part is the final region O represents the central of color and the origin of the coordinate system. Ol represents the half of the horizontal distance and Xt is the point gathered from the color block during the sprint. The offset can bet expressed as Xc-Xt. S represents the length of runway and D1 is the half of width of runway. St is the vertical distance between the robot and color block on real time. ? presents the angle deviate vertical centerline from the robot. Xd is the horizontal coordinate between the danger and safe zone. The flow of the algorithm can be described as bellow Step 1: Recognize the target and gain the corresponding coordinates of pixels Step 2: According to the values of Xt ,Xd and ?, the location of robot is to be judged to whether need to be adjusted. If not, then go to Step 4 Step 3: Adjusting the location of robot by calling the commands of motions Step 4: Whether the goal is reached? If yes then go to Step 6 Step 5: Call the command to make the robot run forward Go to Step 1 Step 6: Call the command to make the robot run backward. Then go to Step 1 SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS 


Fig.3 has shown the results of processing of red color block, which can be achieved that under this light environment, the robot can recognize the target very well The snapshots of HIT-2 robot in the competition of sprint are shown in Fig.4. The interval of every snapshot is one second. The experiment has shown that the robot can reach the goal successfully Fig.3 pictures of image recognition Fig.4 Snapshots of sprint for humanoid robot HIT-2 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK A hierarchy control system based on embedded vision system is proposed. The image is gathered by the camera and decision is made to call the commands to execute the motions in the motion library In this paper, we designed a humanoid robot based on vision system and according to the features of sprint in FIRA The information of feedback of vision system could be adopted as the chief sensor information for the decision system.

mutated by a certain rate, that is, changing 0 to 1, 1 to 0 E. Attributes Reduction After the algorithm is finished, if the genome of some attribute x in the chromosome are all 0, it indicates that the cut-points set of it is empty, that is, attribute x is redundant for the decision-making and can be removed. Reduction set of attributes can be obtained by scanning chromosomes in the optimal population F. Terminating Condition The algorithm finally extracts the rules that meet the confidence threshold given by users, so the final output is not one optimal rule, but rather a set of rules that meet the threshold. The termination conditions we set are: the termination generation is 400, or there is no one rule less than threshold for the continuous 10 generations G. Rules Extraction The frequent rules are generated according to the fitness function and genetic operators. In order to mine the strong association rules finally, these rules must be extracted again Extraction criteria are: output the rule which meets the minimum confidence given by users, otherwise abandon it  IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM According to the thinking above, a new model of immune genetic algorithm for mining association rules MAR_IGA Step1: Initialization. Let evolution generation count t=0 Determine the population size N and minsup, minconf Randomly generate an initial population G\(t Step2: Calculate each individuals fitness in the population G\(t 1 individual. If each genome in the third segment of some chromosome is invalid or all 0, we assign such chromosome a smaller fitness Step3: Filter individual according to the fitness value. If the fitness is greater than 1, keep the individual into the next generation G*\(t number M of individuals retained Step4: If M<N, randomly generate \(N-M put them into G*\(t Step5: Genetic operation 


Calculate the concentration di of each individual in population  G*\(t 3 Calculate the selection probabilities in population G*\(t 2 individuals to get population G'\(t Carry out crossover and mutation on G'\(t next generation of population G\(t+1 Step6: Compare to the termination conditions, if it meets the termination conditions, jump to Step7, otherwise t=t+1 jump back to Step2 Step7: Rules extraction. Restore each chromosome in the final population to the rule, and calculate the confidence of each rule. If confidence ? minconf , output the rule 1449 V. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS A. Descriptions of Experimental Data Sets and the Environment The experiment uses Abalone dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository. The data set has 4177 samples It is composed of a discrete attribute and 8 continuous attributes. In this paper, we only mined such association rules X Y?  that Y was age. The setting of parameters: The size of evolutionary population N=40, crossover rate=0.95 mutation rate=0.01, minsup=0.15, minconf=0.6. The ratio of training data and test data was 1:2. The experiment was executed on Celeron\(R was VC B. Results of the Experiments In order to test the validity of the algorithm MAR_IGA we compared MAR_IGA with the classical genetic algorithm SGA and Apriori. The process of using SGA is: firstly we extracted rules from the discrete data by SGA. Secondly we searched the optimal cut-points set of the continuous data by SGA, and then used SGA to extract rules from the continuous data based on cut-points. And finally we combined the above results of rule extraction as the final optimal population. The process of using Apriori is: firstly we discretized continuous attributes using the discretization method based on the importance of cut-points[11], and then extracted the rules by Apriori. These three methods were run on the above data set. The results are shown in Table I TABLE I.  COMPARISON OF THESE THREE METHODS 


 Number of cut-points Number of rules Number of reduction attributes Execution times\(s MAR_IGA 28 13 5 48 SGA 37 10 6 56 Apriori 30 13 8 70 It can be seen from Table I that the number of reduction attributes got from MAR_IGA is almost the same as SGA but in other areas obvious advantages can be seen compared with SGA. It indicates that MAR_IGA using the immune system is closer to the optimal solution of the problem than the simple genetic algorithm. In addition, the number of the cut-points got from MAR_IGA is almost the same as the number got from Apriori which uses discretization method based on the importance of cut-points. But the Apriori has almost not reduced attributes. It is shown that MAR_IGA has a good effect of the attributes reduction and can get the simple, effective rules while ensuring the importance of the cut-points. To sum up, MAR_IGA get less cut-points of the continuous attributes, take shorter experimental time and get more effective rules VI. CONCLUSION Data can be divided into discrete attributes data and continuous attributes data. A new immune genetic algorithm MAR_IGA is presented in this paper. This algorithm has the following characteristics It uses the chromosomes with three segments simultaneously searching the best cut-points sets of the continuous attributes and extracting association rules, and implying the attributes reduction The immune mechanism is introduced in. It improves the local optimization of genetic algorithm effectively, and ensures the population diversity Simple and effective association rules can be obtained, while not reducing the importance of cutpoints and maintaining the original indistinguishable

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
