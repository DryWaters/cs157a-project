of compute memory and storage which requires a very high bandwidth network Recently proposed direct connect networks like HyperX and Flattened Butterîy 20 of fer lar ge capacity through paths of varying lengths between servers and are highly cost effective for common data center workloads However data center deployments are constrained to multi-rooted tree topologies like Fat-tree and VL2 16 due to shortest path routing and the limitations of commodity data center switch silicon In this work we present Dahu 1  simple enhancements to commodity Ethernet switches to support direct connect networks in data centers Dahu avoids congestion hot-spots by dynamically spreading trafìc uniformly across links and forwarding trafìc over 
non-minimal paths where possible By performing load balancing primarily using local information Dahu can act more quickly than centralized approaches and responds to failure gracefully Our evaluation shows that Dahu delivers up to 500 improvement in throughput over ECMP in large scale HyperX networks with over 130,000 servers and up to 50 higher throughput in an 8,192 server Fat-tree network Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.1  Network Architecture and Design  Netw ork Communications General Terms Design Performance Keywords Data center network Direct connect network 1 INTRODUCTION 
Historically high-speed networks have fallen into two main design spaces High performance computing HPC and supercomputing networks have typically adopted direct network topologies  conìgured so that every switch has some servers connected to it The remaining ports in each switch are used to connect to other switches in the topology eg mesh torus hypercube This type of network is highly resource efìcient and offers high capacity through the presence of many variable-length paths between a source and destination However the choice of which path to forward trafìc over is ultimately controlled by proprietary protocols  1 
Dahu is a legendary creature well known in France with legs of differing lengths in switches NICs and by the end-host application logic This increases the burden on the developer and creates a tight coupling between applications and the network On the other hand scale-out data centers have adopted indirect network topologies  such as folded Clos and Fat-trees in which servers are restricted to the edges of the network fabric There are dedicated switches that are not connected to any servers but simply route trafìc within the network fabric Data centers have a much looser coupling between applications and network topology placing the burden of path selection on network switches themselves 
Given the limited resources and memory available in commodity switches data center networks have historically relied on relatively simple mechanisms for choosing paths e.g Equal-Cost Multi-Path Routing ECMP ECMP relies on static hashing of ows across a xed set of shortest paths to a destination For hierarchical topologies like Fattrees shortest path routing has been lar gely suf cient when there are no failures However recently proposed direct network topologies like HyperX BCube and Flattened Butterîy 1 17 which employ paths of different lengths have not seen adoption in data centers due to the limitations imposed by commodity data center switches and shortest path routing ECMP leaves lot of network capacity untapped when there is localized congestion or hot-spots 
as it ignores uncongested longer paths while forwarding Further even in hierarchical networks ECMP makes it hard to route efìciently under failures when the network is no longer completely symmetric and some non-shortest paths can be utilized to improve network utilization Commodity switches and shortest path routing have led to hierarchical networks in data centers These restrictions on topology and routing also mean that higher level adaptive protocols like MPTCP are unable to tak e adv antage of the full capacity of direct networks because all paths are not exposed to them through routing/forwarding tables The goal of this paper is to bridge the beneìts of direct connect networksÑhigher capacity with fewer switches lower cost 
for common communication patternsÑwith the lower complexity commoditization and decoupled application logic of data center networks To that aim we present Dahu a lightweight switch mechanism that enables us to leverage non-shortest paths with loop-free forwarding while operating locally with small switch state requirements and minimal additional latency Dahu seeks to obtain the beneìts of non-shortest path routing without coupling the application to the underlying topology Dahu supports dynamic ow-level hashing across links resulting in higher network utilization Dahu addresses the local hash imbalance that occurs with ECMP using only local information in the switches 59 978-1-4799-1640-5/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


Dahu makes the following contributions 1 Novel hardware primitives to efìciently utilize non-minimal paths in different topologies with a modest increase in switch state while preventing persistent forwarding loops 2 A virtual port abstraction that enables dynamic multipath trafìc engineering 3 A decentralized load balancing algorithm and heuristic 4 Minimal hardware modiìcations for easy deployability and 5 Large scale simulations on networks with over 130K servers to evaluate Dahuês performance Our evaluation shows that Dahu delivers up to 50 higher throughput relative to ECMP in an 8,192 server Fat-tree network and up to 500 throughput improvement in large HyperX networks with over 130,000 servers We are encouraged by these results and believe that they are a concrete step toward our goal of combining the beneìts of HPC and data center network topologies 2 MOTIVATION AND REQUIREMENTS Fully-provisioned multi-rooted tree topologies are ideal for targeting worst case communication patternsÑwhere all hosts in the network simultaneously try to communicate at access link speeds However common communication patterns have only few network hot-spots and overprovisioning the topology for worst-case trafìc results in high CAPEX Oversubscribing the multi-rooted tree topology would reduce CAPEX but network performance would also suffer in the common case since the oversubscribed layers of the tree have even lower capacity to tolerate hot-spots Direct networks provide an interesting point in the design space of network topologies since they provide good performance for most realistic trafìc patterns at much lower cost than fullyprovisioned Clos networks 1  There are tw o deìning characteristics of direct networks which distinguish them from tree based topologies 1 Hosts are embedded throughout the structure of the network Each switch has some hosts connected to it 2 There are many network paths between any pair of servers but they are of varying length These properties of direct networks allow more exible use of overall network capacity with slack bandwidth in one portion of the network available to be leveraged by other congested parts of the network by forwarding trafìc along longer less congested paths In a sense the oversubscription is spread throughout the network rather than at speciìc stages or points in the topology Direct networks are very popular in HPCÑTitan the worldês fastest supercomputer uses a 3D torus a direct connect topology Ho we v e r  data centers ha v e been lar gely constrained to multi-rooted trees due to commodity switch silicon and shortest path based routing protocols Direct networks have signiìcant potential in meeting the bandwidth requirements for data centers Dahu presents simple enhancements to commodity Ethernet switches both hardware and software to support direct connect topologies in data centers 2.1 Challenges In order to deploy direct connect networks in data centers we need to address the following challenges 1 Non-shortest path routing Current data center switches and routing protocols only support routing over shortest paths Direct networks offer large path diversity between servers but the paths are of varying lengths typically with only a small number of shortest paths Shortest path routing artiìcially constrains bandwidth utilization during periods of localized congestion and trafìc to a destination could potentially achieve higher throughput if alternate longer paths are also used Consider a simple mesh network of four switches as shown in Figure 1 In a the shortest path connecting the sources and destinations is congested by a factor of 3 with a resulting total bandwidth of 1Gbps However by sending some trafìc ows over non-shortest path links as shown in b the total throughput can be increased to 3Gbps H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 S1 S2 S3 S4 H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 S1 S3 S4 S2 1G link a b Figure 1 a Shortest and b Non-shortest path routing 2 Cost-effective commodity switch hardware Direct networks in supercomputers rely on custom designed silicon that is expensive and topology dependent Routing is typically integrated with proprietary protocols in NICs and switches Data center networks on the other hand are built using low cost commodity offthe-shelf switches 2 So commodity Ethernet switch silicon must be enhanced to provide the necessary features to support direct connect topologies in the data center while keeping costs low 3 Dynamic trafìc management Although shortest path routing is the main roadblock to deploying direct networks the static nature of ECMP style forwarding in switches presents a challengeÑeven for indirect networks Hashing ows on to paths oblivious to current link demands or ow rates can result in imbalance signiìcantly reducing achieved throughput compared to innate network capacity There have been several recent proposals for dynamic trafìc engineering in data centers Centralized approaches like Hedera and MicroTE adv ocate a central f abric scheduler that periodically measures trafìc demands and computes good paths for bandwidth intensive ows to maximize bandwidth utilization However they have long control loops that only react to changes in trafìc at timescales on the order of hundreds of milliseconds at best i.e they are only effective for long lived ows Further scaling such centralized approaches to very large numbers of ows in large scale data centers presents challenges in terms of switch state requirements MPTCP is a transport layer solution that splits o ws into subîows that take different paths through the network and modulates the rates of subîows based on congestion However in direct networks MPTCP requires many subîows to probe the different paths making it impractical for short ows We illustrate this in Section 6.4 4 Decouple applications and routing Direct connect networks in supercomputers tightly couple application development and routing which requires application developers to be concerned with workloads routing for certain expected application behaviors etc Data center workloads are much more dynamic and developers often cannot predict the composed behavior of many co-located applications Handling routing functionality entirely in the network signiìcantly simpliìes application development as is done in data centers today 2.2 Dahu Requirements and Design Decisions 1 On-demand non-shortest path routing Dahu should only enable non-minimal paths on demand when shortest paths do not have sufìcient capacity Using shorter paths by default results in fewer switch hops and likely lower end-to-end latency for trafìc 60 


Dahu must achieve this while ensuring there are no persistent forwarding loops 2 Dynamic trafìc engineering Dahu chooses to load balance trafìc primarily using local decisions in each switch which helps react quickly to changing trafìc demands and temporary hot-spots In addition it inter-operates with other routing and trafìc engineering schemes 3 Readily deployable Any proposed changes to switch hardware should be simple enough to be realizable with current technology with minimal required switch state Switches should still make ow-level forwarding decisionsÑi.e packets of a particular ow should follow the same path through the network to the extent possible This avoids excessive packet reordering which can have undesirable consequences for TCP Moving ows to alternate paths periodically at coarse time scales e.g of several RTTs is acceptable 4 Generic/Topology Independent The switch hardware should be topology independent and deployable in a variety of networks including indirect networks Non-shortest path routing is also beneìcial in the case of Clos topologies which are left asymmetric and imbalanced under failures 5 Fault tolerant Failures must be handled gracefully and rerouting of ows upon failure should only affect a small subset of ows so that the effect of failures is proportional to the region of the network that has failed To prevent trafìc herds Dahu should not move many ows in the network around when a single path fails or is congested Rather it should be possible to make ner-grained decisions and migrate a smaller subset of ows to alternate paths Dahu achieves these targets through a combination of switch hardware and software enhancements which we describe in Sections 3 and 4 respectively 3 SWITCH HARDWARE PRIMITIVES Dahu proposes new hardware primitives which enable better ways of utilizing the path diversity in direct connect topologies and addresses some of the limitations of ECMP 3.1 Port Groups With Virtual Ports ECMP spreads trafìc over multiple equal-cost paths to a destination Internally the switch must store state to track which set of ports can be used to reach the destination preìx A common mechanism is storing a list of egress ports in the routing table represented as a bitmap Dahu augments this with a layer of indirection each router preìx points to a set of virtual ports  and each virtual port is mapped to a physical port In fact the number of virtual ports can be much larger than the number of physical ports We deìne a port group as a collection of virtual ports mapped to their corresponding physical ports a many-to-one mapping The routing table is modiìed to allow a pointer to a port group for any destination preìx instead of a physical egress port When multiple egress choices are available for a particular destination preìx the routing table entry points to a port group When the switch receives a packet it looks up the port group for the destination preìx from the routing table It computes a hash based on the packet headers similar to ECMP and uses this to index into the port group to choose a virtual port Finally it forwards the packet on the egress port to which the virtual port is mapped This port group mechanism adds one level of indirection in the switch output port lookup pipeline which we use to achieve better load balancing and support for non-shortest network paths In hardware a port group is simply an array of integers The integer at index i is the egress port number to which virtual port i in that port group is mapped Each port group has a xed number of virtual ports Multiple destination preìxes in the routing table may point to the same port group For the rest of this paper the term member port of a port group is used to refer to a physical port which has some virtual port in the port group mapped to it The virtual port to egress port mapping provides an abstraction for dynamically migrating trafìc from one egress port to another within any port group Each virtual port is mapped to exactly one egress port at any time but this mapping can be changed dynamically A key advantage of the indirection layer is that when a virtual port is remapped only the ows which hash to that virtual port are migrated to other egress ports Other ows remain on their existing paths and their packets donêt get re-ordered All ows that map to a virtual port can only be remapped as a group to another egress port Thus virtual ports dictate the granularity of trafìc engineering with more virtual ports providing ner grained control over trafìc We propose that each port group have a relatively large number of virtual portsÑon the order of 1,000 for high-radix switches with 64-128 physical ports That means each virtual port is responsible for an average of 0.1 or less of the total trafìc to the port group If required the routing table can be augmented with more ne grained forwarding entries Each port group keeps a set of counters corresponding to each member port indicating how much trafìc the port group has forwarded to that port While having a trafìc counter for each virtual port provides ne grained state it comes at a higher cost for two reasons 1 The memory required to store the counters is fairly large For example a switch with 64 port groups 1,024 virtual ports per port group and 64 bit trafìc counters needs 512KB of on-chip memory just for these port group counters 2 Reading all 65,536 counters from hardware to switch software would take a long time increasing the reaction time of trafìc engineering schemes that use all these counters for computations Dahu uses the port group mechanism and associated counters to implement a novel load balancing scheme described in Section 4 3.2 Allowed Port Bitmaps Port groups enable the use of multiple egress port choices for any destination preìx However it is sometimes useful to have many egress ports in a port group but use only a subset of them for forwarding trafìc to a particular preìx One reason to do this is to avoid forwarding on failed egress ports Consider two preìxes in the routing table F 1 and F 2 both of which point to port group G 1 which has member egress ports P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4  Suppose a link fails and egress port P 4 cannot be used to reach preìx F 1  whereas all member ports can still be used to reach F 2 Now,one option is to create another port group G 2 with member ports P 1 P 2 and P 3 only for preìx F 1  This can quickly result in the creation of many port groups for a large network which might experience many failures at once We propose a more scalable approach where we continue to use the existing port group but restrict the subset of member ports which are used for forwarding trafìc to a particular destination For each destination preìx in the routing table we store an allowed port bitmap  which indicates the set of egress ports that are allowed to be used to reach the preìx The bitmap is as wide as the number of egress ports and only the bits corresponding to the allowed egress ports for the preìx are set One way to restrict forwarding to the allowed egress ports is to compute a hash for the packet and check if the corresponding port group virtual port maps to an allowed egress port If not we compute another hash for the packet and repeat until we nd an allowed egress port To pick an allowed port efìciently we propose a parallel scheme where the switch computes 16 different hash functions for the 61

HyperCube each switchês position can be denoted by a vector of L coordinates each coordinate being 0 or 1 Any two switches that differ in their coordinate vectors in exactly one dimension are connected by a bidirectional link Each switch has some xed number T of servers attached to it Eg a regular cube is a 3-dimensional HyperCube with 8 switches and 12 edges 1 2 3 4 1 Shortest path 2 4 3 Non-shortest paths deroute count = 1 Ingress Switch Egress Switch Dimension 1 Dimension 2 0,0 1,0 2,0 2,1 2,2 1,1 0,1 0,2 1,2 Figure 3 HyperX topology  L 2 S 3 Only switches and the links between them are shown for clarity The T servers connected to each switch are not shown in the gure The position of the switches is shown on a 2-dimensional lattice The paths between switches 0 0 and 2 0 with at most 1 derouting are shown Ingress switch 0 0 and the egress switch 2 0 are offset along dimension 1 and aligned along dimension 2 A regular  L  S  T  HyperX is a generalization of the HyperCube where the switch coordinates in each dimension are integers in the range 0 S  rather than just 0 o r 1  A gain an y t w o switches whose coordinate vectors differ in only one dimension are directly connected Figure 3 shows an example of a 2-dimensional HyperX network with the switches overlaid on a 2-D lattice An offset dimension for a pair of switches is one in which their coordinates differ Similarly an aligned dimension for a pair of switches is one in which their coordinates are the same Some examples of HyperX topologies are 1 A HyperCube is a regular HyperX with S 2 and 2 An L 1 HyperX is just a fully connected graph 4.2 Non-Minimal Routing As described earlier ECMP constrains trafìc routes to the set of shortest paths between any pair of switches While this keeps path lengths low it can also impose artiìcial constraints on available bandwidth Direct connect networks like HyperX have many paths of differing length between any pair of nodes In a HyperX switch S s  there are three classes of egress port choices to reach any destination switch S d  1 Set of shortest path egress ports to reach S d  The size of the set is equal to the number of offset dimensions i.e dimensions in which the switch coordinates of S s and S d differ In Figure 3 the egress port on switch 0 0 along path 1 is a short path egress port 2 Set of egress ports connected to neighbors along offset dimensions excluding the shortest path egress ports Each of these neighbors is at the same distance from S d  equal to the shortest path distance from S s to S d  In Figure 3 the egress port on switch 0 0 along path 2 is in this set 3 All the remaining ports that are connected to other switches The egress ports which connect to neighbors along dimensions already aligned with S d are members of this class Each of these neighbors is one additional hop away from S d as compared to the shortest path distance from S s to S d  In Figure 3 the egress ports on switch 0,0 along paths 3 and 4 are in this set Dahuês port group mechanism and allowed port bitmaps enable switches to efìciently route along non-minimal paths The number of shortest and non-minimal path egress ports for a single destination preìx is not limited artiìcially unlike n-way ECMP We now look in more detail at how to enable non-minimal routing in direct connect networks 4.2.1 Space saving techniques A strawman solution for non-minimal routing is to create one port group for each destination preìx For each preìxês port group we make all appropriate physical ports both along shortest paths and non-minimal paths to the destination members of the port group When a switch receives a packet it looks up the port group for the destination preìx and hashes the packet onto one of the virtual ports in the port group Use of some of the corresponding egress ports results in non-minimal forwarding One characteristic of the HyperX topology is that in any source switch the set of shortest path egress ports is different for each destination switch These ports must be stored separately for each destination switch thereby requiring a separate destination preìx and a separate port group in case of the strawman solution For a large HyperX network the corresponding switch memory overhead would be impractical For example a network with 2,048 128-port switches and 1,024 virtual ports per port group would need 2 MB of on-chip SRAM just to store the port group mapping excluding counters Thus we seek to aggregate more preìxes to share port groups We now describe some techniques to use a small number of port groups to enable the use of non-minimal paths while using only shortest paths whenever possible In a HyperX switch any egress port that is connected to another switch can be used to reach any destination However not all egress ports would result in paths of equal length Let us assume that we only use a single port group PG all  say with 1,024 virtual ports All physical ports in the switch connected to other switches are members of the port group PG all  If we simply used this port group for all preìxes in the routing table that would enable non-minimal forwarding for all destinations Dahu uses the allowed port bitmap hardware primitive to restrict forwarding to shorter paths when possible If Dahu determines that only shortest paths need to be used for a particular destination preìx the B short allowed port bitmap for the preìx is used for forwarding even when the derouting count has not reached the maximum threshold Otherwise the allowed port bitmap is expanded to also include egress ports that would result in one extra hop being used and so on for longer paths For HyperX there are only three classes of egress port choices by distance to destination as described earlier in our basic non-minimal routing scheme we either restrict forwarding to the shortest path ports or allow all paths to the destination all member ports of PG all  We now look at the question of how Dahu determines when additional longer paths have to be enabled for a destination preìx to meet trafìc demands Switches already have port counters for the total trafìc transmitted by each physical port Periodically e.g 63 


1  Compute aggregate utilization \(Agg Cap short bitmap 2  If Agg / Cap < Threshold Set allowed ports to B short there is sufficient capacity along shortest paths for this prefix Else, set allowed ports to B all  Figure 4 Restricting non-minimal forwarding every 10ms the switch software reads all egress port counters iterates over each destination preìx and performs the steps shown in Figure 4 to enable non-minimal paths based on current utilization It is straightforward to extend this technique to progressively enable paths of increasing lengths instead of all non-minimal paths at once In summary we have a complete mechanism for forwarding trafìc along shorter paths whenever possible using just a single port group and enabling non-minimal routing whenever required for capacity reasons 4.2.2 Constrained non-minimal routing As described earlier in a HyperX network each switch has three classes of egress port choices to reach any destination Based on this Dahu deìnes a constrained routing scheme as followsÑa switch can forward a packet only to neighbors along offset dimensions If a packet is allowed to use non-minimal routing at a switch it can only be derouted along already offset dimensions Once a dimension is aligned we do not further deroute the packet along that dimension After each forwarding choice along the path taken by a packet it either moves closer to the destination or stays at the same distance from the destination We call this scheme Dahu constrained routing  For this technique we create one port group for each possible set of dimensions in which the switch is offset from the destination switch This uses 2 L port groups where L  the number of dimensions is usually small e.g 3Ö5 This allows migrating groups of ows between physical ports at an even smaller granularity than with a single port group This technique is largely inspired by Dimensionally Adaptive Load balanced DAL routing Ho we v e r  there are some k e y differences DAL uses per-packet load balancing whereas Dahu uses ow level hashing to reduce TCP reordering DAL allows at most one derouting in each offset dimension but Dahu allows any number of deroutings along offset dimensions until the derouting threshold is reached 4.3 Trafìc Load Balancing Per-packet uniform distribution of trafìc across available paths from a source to destination can theoretically lead to very good network utilization in some symmetric topologies such as Fat-trees But this is not used in practice due to the effects of packet reordering and faults on the transport protocol ECMP tries to spread trafìc uniformly across shortest length paths at the ow level instead But due to its static nature there can be local hash imbalances Dahu presents a simple load balancing scheme using local information at each switch to spread trafìc more uniformly Each Dahu switch performs load balancing with the objective of balancing or equalizing the aggregate load on each egress port This also balances bandwidth headroom on each egress port so TCP ow rates can grow This simpliìes our design and enables us to avoid more complex demand estimation approaches When multiple egress port choices are available we can remap virtual ports between physical ports thus getting ne grained control over trafìc Intuitively in any port group the number of virtual ports that map to any member port is a measure of the fraction of trafìc from the port group that gets forwarded through that member port We now describe the constraints and assumptions under which we load balance trafìc at each switch in the network 4.3.1 Design Considerations Periodically each switch uses local information to rebalance trafìc This allows the switch to react quickly to changes in trafìc demand and rebalance port groups more frequently than a centralized approach or one that requires information from peers Note that this design decision is not fundamentalÖcertainly virtual port mappings can be updated through other approaches For different topologies more advanced schemes may be required to achieve global optimality such as through centralized schemes We assume that each physical port might also have some trafìc that is not re-routable  So Dahuês local load balancing scheme is limited to moving the remainder of trafìc within port groups Dahuês techniques can inter-operate with other trafìc engineering approaches For example a centralized controller can make globally optimal decisions for placing elephant ows on efìcient paths in the network or higher layer adapti v e schemes lik e MPTCP can direct more trafìc onto uncongested paths Dahuês heuristic corrects local hashing inefìciencies and can make quick local decisions within a few milliseconds to avoid temporary congestion This can be complemented by a centralized or alternate approach that achieves global optimality over longer time scales of few hundreds of milliseconds 4.3.2 Control Loop Overview Every Dahu switch periodically rebalances the aggregate trafìc on its port groups once each epoch e.g every 10ms At the end of each rebalancing epoch the switch performs the following 3 step process Step 1  Measure current load  The switch collects the following local information from hardware counters 1 a  for each port group the amount of trafìc that the port group sends to each of the member ports and 1 b  for each egress port the aggregate bandwidth used on the port Step 2  Compute balanced allocation  The switch computes a balanced trafìc allocation for port groups i.e the amount of trafìc each port group should send in a balanced setup to each of its member ports We describe two ways of computing this in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 Step 3  Remap port groups  The switch then determines which virtual ports in each port group must be remapped to other member ports in order to achieve a balanced trafìc allocation and changes the mapping accordingly We have the current port group trafìc matrix measured and the computed balanced trafìc allocation matrix for each port group to it member egress ports As mentioned in Section 3.1 a switch only maintains counters for the total trafìc from a port group to each of its member ports We treat all virtual ports that map to a particular member port as equals and use port group counters to compute the average trafìc that each of the virtual ports is responsible for Then we remap an appropriate number of virtual ports to other member ports depending on the intended trafìc allocation matrix using a rst-ìt heuristic In general this remapping problem is similar to bin packing 4.4 Load Balancing Algorithm We now describe an algorithm for computing a balanced trafìc allocation on egress ports Based on the measured trafìc the 64

matrix row then the respective matrix element is zeroed Additionally the Aggregate utilization row of elements stores the total bandwidth utilization on each egress port This is the bandwidth based on the egress port counter and accounts for trafìc forwarded by any of the port groups as well as background trafìc on the port that is not re-routable using port groups such as elephant ows pinned to the path by Hedera We rst pick a port group in the matrix and try to balance the aggregate trafìc for each of the member ports by moving trafìc from this port group to different member ports where possible To do this Dahu computes the average aggregate utilization of all member ports of the port group Then it reassigns the trafìc for that port group to equalize the aggregate trafìc for the member ports to the extent possible If a member portês aggregate trafìc exceeds the average across all members and the member port receives some trafìc from this port group then we reassign the trafìc to other member ports as appropriate Dahu performs this operation for all port groups and repeats until convergence To ensure convergence we terminate the algorithm when subsequent iterations ofîoad less than a small constant threshold   Figure 5 shows the steps in the algorithm Host facing ports in the switch can be ignored when executing this algorithm 4.5 Load Balancing Heuristic The load balancing algorithm considers all physical ports and port groups in the switch and aims to balance the aggregate load on all of them to the extent possible However the algorithm may take many steps to converge for a large switch with many ports and port groups We now describe a quick and practical heuristic to compute the balanced trafìc allocation The key idea behind the heuristic is to ofîoad trafìc from the highest loaded port to the least loaded port with which it shares membership in any of the port group instead of trying to balance the aggregate load on all ports By running the heuristic quickly the switch can balance the port groups at time scales on the order of a few milliseconds The heuristic as described in Figure 6 is repeated for some xed number R say 16 of highest loaded switch ports and has a low runtime of around 1ms The runtime depends on the number of physical ports and port groups in the switch and is independent of the number of ows in the system Our research grade implementation of the heuristic for our simulator running on a general purpose x86 CPU showed average runtimes of few 10ês of microsec1  Sort the physical ports by their aggregate utilization 2  Offload traffic from the highest loaded port H1 to the least loaded port with which it shares membership in any port group 3  Continue offloading traffic from H1 to the least loaded ports in order until they are completely balanced or H1 runs out of lesser loaded ports to offload to Figure 6 Load Balancing Heuristic onds to 0.5 milliseconds even for large networks with over 130,000 servers We believe an optimized version targeted at a switch ARM or PPC processor can run within 1ms with a small DRAM requirement of under 10 MB In the rest of this paper we employ this heuristic for load balancing 4.6 Fault Tolerance Dahu relies on link-level techniques for fault detection and uses existing protocols to propagate fault updates through the network If a particular egress link or physical port P f on the switch is down the virtual ports in each port group which map to P f are remapped to other member ports of the respective port groups The remapping is performed by switch software and the actual policy could be as simple as redistributing the virtual ports uniformly to other egress ports or something more complicated On the other hand when the switch receives fault notiìcations from the rest of the network a speciìc egress port P f may have to be disabled for only some destination preìxes because of downstream faults We use the allowed port bitmaps technique described in Section 3.2 to just disable P f for speciìc preìxes The virtual port to physical port mappings in the port groups are left unchanged In both scenarios the only ows migrated to other egress ports are ones that were earlier mapped to the failed egress port P f  When a physical port comes up some virtual ports automatically get mapped to it the next time port groups are balanced 5 DEPLOYABILITY Deployability has been an important goal during the design of Dahu In this section we look at two primary requirements for 65 


adding Dahu support to switches the logic to implement the functionality and the memory requirements of the data structures To our knowledge existing switch chips do not provide Dahulike explicit hardware support for non-minimal routing in conjunction with dynamic trafìc engineering However there are some similar efforts including Broadcomês resilient hashing feature in their modern switch chips which is targeted at handling link failure and live topology updates and the Group Table feature in the recent OpenFlow 1.1 Speciìcation which uses a layer of indirection in the switch datapath for multipath support The increasing popularity of OpenFlow software deìned networks and custom computing in the control plane via embedded ARM style processors in modern switch silicon indicates a new trend that we can leverage where large data centers operators are adopting the idea of a programmable control plane for the switches The need for switch hardware modiìcation to support customizable control plane for switches is no longer a barrier to innovation as indicated by the deployment of switches with custom hardware by companies like Google To implement the hardware logic we also need sufìcient memory in the chip to support the state requirements for Dahu functionality We now brieîy estimate this overhead Consider a large Dahu switch with 128 physical ports 64 port groups with 1,024 virtual ports each 16,384 preìxes in the routing table and support for up to two different allowed port bitmaps for each preìx The extra state required for all of Dahuês features is a modest 640 KB Of this 64 KB each are required for storing the virtual to physical port mappings for all the port groups and the port group counters per egress port 512 KB is required for storing two bitmaps for each destination preìx A smaller 64 port switch would only need a total of 352 KB for a similar number of port groups and virtual ports This memory may come at the expense of additional packet buffers typically around 10 MB however recent trends in data center congestion management 4 indicate that trading a small amount of buffer memory for more adaptive routing may be worthwhile 6 EVALUATION We evaluated Dahu through ow-level simulations on both HyperX and Fat-tree topologies Overall our results show 1 10-50 throughput improvement in Fat-tree networks and 250-500 improvement in HyperX networks compared to ECMP 2 With an increase of only a single network hop Dahu achieves signiìcant improvements in throughput 3 Dahu scales to large networks of over 130,000 nodes 4 Dahu enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve higher throughput with fewer subîows The evaluation seeks to provide an understanding of Dahuês effect on throughput and hop count in different network topologies HyperX and Fat-tree under different trafìc patterns We rst present a description of the simulator that we used for our experiments and the methodology for validating its accuracy We simulate HyperX networks large and small and measure throughput as well as expected hop count for different workloads We then move on to evaluate Dahu on an 8,192 host Fat-tree network using two communication patterns We conclude this section by evaluating how MPTCP beneìts from Dahu through the use of non-shortest paths 6.1 Simulator We evaluated Dahu using a ow level network simulator that models the performance of TCP ows We used the ow level simulator from Hedera and added support for decentralized routing in each switch port groups allowed port bitmaps and the load balancing heuristic The Dahu-augmented Hedera simulator evaluates the AIMD behavior of TCP ow bandwidths to calculate the total throughput achieved by ows in the network We built a workload generator that generates open-loop input trafìc proìles for the simulator It creates trafìc proìles with different distributions of ow inter-arrival times and ow sizes This allows us to evaluate Dahuês performance over a wide range of trafìc patterns including those based on existing literature 6 Modeling the AIMD behavior of TCP ow bandwidth instead of per-packet behavior means that the simulator does not model TCP timeouts retransmits switch buffer occupancies and queuing delay in the network The simulator only models unidirectional TCP data ows but not the reverse ow for ACKs We believe this is justiìed since the bandwidth consumed by ACKs is quite negligible compared to data We chose to make these trade-offs in the simulator to evaluate at a large scaleÑover 130K servers which would not have been possible otherwise We simulated ve seconds of trafìc in each experiment and each switch rebalanced port groups 16 highest loaded ports and recomputed preìx bitmaps every 10ms For non-shortest path forwarding switches used 80 of available capacity along shortest paths to the destination as the threshold utilization to dynamically enable nonshortest paths These values were chosen based on empirical measurements  Figure 7 Simulator throughput vs theoretical maximum Simulator Validation To validate the throughput numbers reported by the simulator we generated a range of trafìc proìles with a large number of long-lived ows between random hosts in a L 3 S 8 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links  L  S  T deìned in Section 4.1 We computed the theoretical maximum bandwidth achievable for the trafìc patterns by formulating maximum multi-commodity network ow problems and solving them using the CPLEX linear program solv er both for shortest path routing and non-minimal routing We also ran our simulator on the same trafìc proìle As shown in Figure 7 the aggregate throughput reported by the simulator was within the theoretical maximum for all the trafìc patterns that we validated In case of shortest path forwarding the theoretical and simulator numbers matched almost perfectly indicating that the ECMP implementation was valid With non-minimal forwarding the simulatorês performance is reasonably close to the theoretical limit Note that the multi-commodity ow problem simply optimizes for the total network utilization whereas the simulator and TCP in general also take fairness into account 66 


In addition we also explicitly computed the max-min fair ow bandwidths for these trafìc proìles using the water-ìlling algorithm W e compared the resulting aggre gate throughput to those reported by the simulator For all evaluated trafìc patterns the simulator throughput was within 10 of those reported by the maxmin validator This small difference is because the TCPês AIMD congestion control mechanism only yields approximate max-min fairness in ow bandwidths whereas the validator computes a perfectly max-min fair distribution 6.2 HyperX Networks We rst evaluate Dahu with HyperX networks which have many paths of differing lengths between any source and destination We simulate a  L 3 S 14 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links as described in This models a lar ge data center with 131,712 servers interconnected by 2,744 switches and an oversubscription ratio of 1:8 We seek to measure how Dahuês non-minimal routing and load balancing affect performance as we vary trafìc patterns the maximum derouting threshold and non-minimal routing scheme constrained or not We run simulations with Clique and Mixed trafìc patterns described next and compare the throughput average hop count and link utilizations for Dahu and ECMP In the graphs Dahun refers to Dahu routing with at most n deroutings C-Dahun refers to the similar Constrained Dahu routing variant 6.2.1 Clique Trafìc Pattern A Clique is a subset of switches and associated hosts that communicate among themselves each host communicates with every other host in its clique over time This represents distributed jobs in a data center which are usually run on a subset of the server pool A typical job runs on a few racks of servers There could be multiple cliques or jobs running in different parts of the network We parameterize this trafìc pattern by i clique size the number of switches in the clique and ii total number of cliques in the network In this experiment we vary the total number of cliques from 64 to 768 keeping the clique size xed at 2 switches 96 servers Each source switch in a clique generates 18Gbps of trafìc with 1.5 MB average ow size  Figure 8 Throughput gain with Clique trafìc pattern Bandwidth Figure 8 shows the bandwidth gains with Dahu relative to ECMP as we vary the number of communicating cliques Dahu offers substantial gains of 400-500 over ECMP The performance gain is highest with a smaller number of cliques showing that indeed derouting and non-shortest path forwarding can effectively take advantage of excess bandwidth in HyperX networks a Average hop count         b Link utilization number of cliques  512 Figure 9 Average hop count and link utilization for Clique trafìc pattern with different routing schemes This validates a major goal of this work which is improving the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth in direct network topologies As the number of cliques increases the bandwidth slack in the network decreases and the relative beneìt of non-minimal routing comes down to around 250 Dahu and constrained Dahu have similar performance for the same derouting threshold We further nd that a large derouting threshold provides larger beneìt with less load since there are many unused links in the network As load increases links are more utilized on average bandwidth slack reduces and a derouting threshold of one starts performing better Hop count Beyond raw throughput latency in an important performance metric that is related to network hop count Figure 9a shows the average hop count for each routing scheme Dahu delivers signiìcantly higher bandwidth with a small increase in average hop count Average hop count increases with increase in derouting threshold For smaller derouting threshold the hop count is similar to that of ECMP while still achieving most of the bandwidth improvements of non-minimal routing Note that the small error bars indicate that the average hop count is similar while varying the number of cliques Link utilization Figure 9b shows the CDF of inter-switch link utilizations for ECMP and Dahu for the experiment with 512 cliques With shortest path routing 90 of the links have zero utilization whereas Dahu achieves its bandwidth gains by utilizing available capacity on additional links in the network Also we see that a single derouting can achieve most of the overall bandwidth gains while consuming bandwidth on signiìcantly fewer links in the network thereby sparing network capacity for more trafìc 67

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
