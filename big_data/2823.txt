But for larger N, the number of sample po ints, is selected, not only windows effect is reduced and f requency resolution is improved but also export that the frequency domain signal to noise ratio is N times increase of time-domain. So when N is a greater value using DFT measuring frequency algorithm can detect small signal submerged in the noise A realization scheme is given based on the big point DFT radar reconnaissance digital receiver, and export the quantitative relationship about sense pulse modulation radar signals. With the development of component technology and improvement of algorithm long-data DFT has sufficient computing speed now, which provides the probability of its application in digital receiver Long FFT use generally 2-dimension algorithm and its implementation method on FPGA are also talked about  Key words digital receiver, DFT, windows effect, signal to noise ratio, FFT  I I NTRODUCTION Radar reconnaissance digital receiver is a embranchment of modern electron warfare reconnaissance receiver, which used to obtain the enemy's rad ar information, and it is a important component of electronic intelligen ce  safeguard system 1 In order to detect complex unknown signal in a modern high-density, highly com plex environment of the electronic signals to demand the receiver to transmit high bandwidth, high sensitivity an d resolution, large dynamic information, signal can long-term storage for later analysis and the application of flexib le signal processing methods capable of handling si gnals arrived at the same time, other information is not lost as fast-Transform targets etc. The scheme commonly used about radar reconnaissance digital receiver are: direct DFT transform digital receiver, lack of sampling multi-channel pa rallel digital receiv ers, frequency channel digital receiver and booting digital receivers 2  DFT is the most commonly used signal processing technology, has got considerable attention sin ce long period The application of DFT technology in the receiver can overcome single-bit receivers can not handle multiple signals get simultaneously, nor the broa dband signal cross-channel issues in the frequency channel receiver. More important is the distribution of time-frequency signal which bases on the STFT \(short-time Fourier transf orm\given and can have a more profound cognition to the signal structur e when the data processing subsection. Limited by devices computational capabilities, receiver us ed to adopt short data DFT measuring-frequency methods. When the reconnaissance target is locked for the pulse radar signals because of this signal mostly is the unknown parameters of the cycle signals, the time-frequency analysis function of short data DFT isn’t role play. On the contrary, the use of the big points DFT measuring-frequency methods, on the one hand can reduce the effect of window domino effect to DFT and increase measuring-frequency accuracy of the signals, on the other hand through th e accumulation of DFT, will be able to detection the weak Radar signal hide the noise. With the level progress of de vice and improvement of the algorithm the constraint of the big points DFT is broke through in computational capabilities, it have practical application in radar reconnaissance digital receiver II C HARACTERISTICS OF DFT A  DFT definition Fourier transform is a tran sformation tools between the time domain and frequency domain, Fourier transform, in essence, is constituted of many different frequency sine or cosine waves which time-domain signal will be broken down into , and this could be transform the Research of signal  xn into the study of th eir weights. But the spectrum by the Fourier is the de mographic characteristics of the signal, it is the integral about whole time-domain, any moment of time-domain waveform signals are included all the information in the frequency-domain Signals. So continuous Fourier transform is limited by time-domain function must be able to form that can be closed and difficulties in the calculation of con tinuous functions integral Therefore, in engineering applications, the real Fourier transform translate into the Discrete Fourier Transform to approximate calculation 3  Discrete Fourier Transform com putational formula is 1 0     0 1 N nk N n Xk DFTxn xnW k N         1 ______________________________________ 978-1-4244-2193-0/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 


Direct calculate to complete full point DFT, the total amount of computation to the plural multiplication and the plural addition. The Fast Fourier Transform FFT\use of symmetry character and periodicity character the long sequence of DFT divided into short sequences DFT can great extent improve the computing speed. At present there are many fast algorithm for calculating the DFT, including ba se-2 FFT algorithm, base-4 FFT algorithm, split-base algorith m, the main factor decomposition algorithm, Winograd "small N" algorithm etc For FPGA Implementation, base-2 and base-4 algorithm is conformable big points FFT algorithm 4-5  2 N nk N W 1 NN   B  DFT windows effect In digital signal processi ng, the actual physical signals which need detect or process usually non-time limit, but as the restrictions such as computi ng speed and handle the workload and computer storage capacity, we can only select limited time-long data sample to be handled. This means that in the digital signal processing the original non-time limit signal must be cut off, which is equivalent to the original infinite raw data sequence data through a window Hypothesis enter sequence  x n  which length is N, its Fourier transform is  j X e  the choice of spectrum of window function is  wn  j We   well then the Fourier transform results Ye  j  of the sequence which comes from  yn  x n addition window is   1   DTFT      2 jj Ye xnwn Xe We d    j          2  By the theory of DFT, it is kn own that the DFT results of  is a uniform N discrete sampling points on the circle in fact. The effect of addition window on the DFT performs in reducing the frequ ency spectrum resolution and producing energy leakage. DFT resolution refers to the capacity of the two neighboring peak which can be distinguished in the real spectrum of the signal. The size of the resolution after addition window depends on the main valve width BW of the spectrum window, only the di stance of two frequency spectrum more than the width of the main valve about the spectrum window, the two peaks can be resolved out leakage of the spectrum is power or energy which concentrated in a narrow-band frequency Domain spreads to the nearby bands, this is th e result which true signal spectrum  yn  j X e   and the Side lobe of the spectrum window  j We   convolves.  As the existence of leakage domino effects, in the larger side lobe of spectrum window  j We   sometimes can cover up the smaller peaks of true spectrum  j  X e  or produce spectrum peaks does not exist in the real spectrum peaks at all. In order to reduce leakage domino effects, you can choose other smaller Side window function than the rectangular window. the main lobe of Window function spectrum is elected should try to narrow as much as possible so that energy can concentrated in the main lobe, so in spectrum analysis there has a higher frequency resolution, the height of the window spectrum side lobe as little as possible and with the frequen cy as soon as possible attenuation, accordingly reduce th e leakage distortion in the estimated spectrum When the sequence length N is larger, it equivalent the time-breadth of the window function which multiplied is longer, this can reduce the truncation function of the window signals contained in the se quence. From the frequency domain perspective, the frequency spectrum of window function becomes narrow and the frequency resolution is improved C  DFT signal Signal-to-No ise ratio on the increase For the plural Sine-sequence of Gaussian white noise expressed as 0 jn xAe     0,1 1 nvnn   N  3 0  is the signal’s digital frequency, then when 0 2 k 0  N   signal frequency matching the output spectrum of one DFT. Assumed that the noise in time-domain is not relevant, and in time-domain the noise power can be written as 2 012 Then corresponding noise power 2 f 012  in the frequency-domain is expressed as  11 2 2/2 00 2  2         NN jmkN jnkN fm mn jnnkN kE ve ve eNEvnvnN   012 012      n 1 0  N nn n EV kV Evv    015\015              4 This shows that in the frequency domain, the noise has the same distribution, but the variance increases N times Therefore there is 2 m f X  22 22 2  22 2 f SNAAS NN NN N 012\012\012 015 015      5 At 00 2 kN   time, the frequency signals do not match the output spectrum lines of a certain DFT and will reduce.

Especially when N is a greater value, reconnaissance receiver using DFT measuring frequency algorithm can detect small signal submerged in the noise. From another perspective, N point 


DFT equivalent of a coherent direction for accumulation. For the signal it has accumulation function, and the noise with stochastic range and phase is not accumulated III DFT BIG POINTS IN THE APPLICATION OF RECONNAISSANCE RECEIVER Despite the method of measuring the frequency based on DFT has disadvantage effect of the window domino effect, it also have the merits to overcome measured signals’ low signal to noise ratio and can detect signals at the same time reach.. Particularly with the development of FPGA devices the time which the big points FFT required substantially decline, so measuring frequency surveillance system based on the big points FFT, can greatly increase the detection probability of space weak signals and solve the problem about signal arrived at the same time A  application algorithm and quantitative analysis A big point DFT radar reconnaissance receiver designs as shown in Figure 1 Broadband analog sign al is converted by the A / D, at the first pass time-domain multiply window module, a re-N-point FFT computing \(N ranged from 256 K 1M\s to the frequency domain. After completion the frequency spectrum detection module searches whether radar signal is there. If the signal is detected there, then the more the signal separation, after the completion of separation using M point IFFT computing \(M adopt 64 K\the time-domain signal reconstruction. The signal is the narrow-band signal after the separation in general, so it can only take effective bandwidth of the frequency domain data M needs to fill zero to M point\nally give a complete pulse description of the word \(PDW\gnal separation through the time-domain detection module Fig 1  Operating flowchart of system Below is derived detection radar signal pulse modulation of the quantitative relationship, Assuming a sampling frequency S f FFT points N, IFFT points M, sampling interval and with the resolution frequency, respectively is 1 S t  f  6  S f fN   7 In FFT spectrum, the corresponding frequency value of the location point k is  s f f kf k N    8 After signal separation, to the FFT spectrum data which contains effectively bandwidth do M point I FFT transform transform it to the time domain and its resolution time is 1 s NN tt Mf Mf M       t  9 The sampling time of each swatch \(or detection time 0 TMtN    10 In IFFT results, the corresponding time value of the location point n is tnt    11 B  The rapid algorithm of DFT big points In order to improve the degree of parallel of the system and reduce the ne eds of memory capacity of the system, can change one-dimensional FFT points into the two-dimensional L M  treatment, that is, at first row transform then to line transform. Select rows transform L 1024 as a fixed point FFT, adopt base-4 algorithm to realize in order to reduce the demand of chip ping-pong memory line transform is 2 n M  variable points to transform FFT use base-2 algorithm to realize, to meet Requirements of the system points changing. In the system, the transformation between line and rows can be realized by two FPGA chip Data matrix between the two FPGA chip need to re-order, so the data need to go through cache, after multiplied by the rotating factor ,the transformation from rows FPGA transmit to line transform FPGA 7-8 Two-dimensional FFT / IFFT process Data rearrangement, N point data arrange L M  point format, including fixed L 1024 Each row of the matrix do fast Fourier transform, that is, do the M-L, one-dimensional FFT computing; Output of row Transform multiplied by the rotating factor keep into the middle of a data matrix \(L line M row\Each of the middle of the matrix will do Fast Fourier transform, that is, do L-M one-dimensional FFT computing; The whole sequence output For each level of transformation, since the array structure size too large, difficult to achieve, and the processing speed of recursive structure is slower, it will be difficult to achieve system requirements. Although parallel structure can achieve faster processing speed, too much demand about the butterfly computing unit and the wider memory bandwidth. It not only easy to structure the cascade of a pipeline handle mode enables the processor to achieve 100 percent efficiency, but also when the points need to changed the system easily reconstruct, so it becomes principal choice for structure of a high-speed real time variable-point FFT processor Based on the abov e analysis, FFT / IFFT subsystem major consists of two parts, shown in Fi gure 2. The main functions of the two modules are one-dimensional FFT processor, also including reading data circulation cascade structure control FFT processor modules accomplish line transform or row transform; Reading data cycle control module for the completion of the data generated address, read, reverse order and output variable operation and the realization of the control changing points function. Line transform FPGA holds the output of the first-class FFT \(intermediate data 


Reading data circulation control, and deliver to line transform FPGA. Data temporary memory for storing intermediate data, the rotation factor of memory for storing rotation factor, as the largest processing point for 1024 1024, the number of data and rotating factor is larger therefore, need to storage intermediate data by using the RAM chip, The ROM chip storage rotation factor. According to the real-time data processing speed of the external circuit decide whether need the import and export memory, if the processing speed of a applications system and processor FFT correspond, you can not use the input and output memory but need system to input FFT processor according to sequence the length of the system based on data in with the reverse requirements, and in time process the output of FFT processor Fig 2  Composing of FFT/IFFT module IV C ONCLUSIONS The realization of big points FFT in system-level FPGA for the radar detection receiver application the big points DFT provides a core guarantee. DFT using the big point of the channel could reduce the total number of channels, and can also bring into full play the advantages of the DFT points Based on the foregoing scheme, FFT transform points to 256 K, IFFT transform points to 64 K  the pulse radar signals reconnaissance receiver of 1 GHz bandwidth has been successfully applied R EFERENCES  Jam es Tsui, translate by  Yang Xiao niu Wideband digital receiver  Beijing China: Electronics Industry Publishing House, 2006  FU Yongqing, Li Yu B ased on the m u lti-phase filter channel receiver and its application research”,Signal processing,China, pp.517 520,May,2004  W a ng Shiy i Digital signal processin Beijing China: Beijing Institute of Technology press, 2001  Lu C, Cooley J W  Tollim ier i R, “FFT algor ith m s for prim e tr ansform  sizes and their implementations on VAX”, IBM3090VF, and IBM RS/6000.

transmitter and receiver This table would include entries such as the bandwidth modulation coding carrier frequency etc The next 16 bits of the R3 field define the number of frames remaining before the new format is to take effect This count field serves multiple purposes but in each case it allows adequate time for the receiver to prepare for the reconfiguration In a typical scenario the transmitter will determine that a format change is necessary at some point in the near future It announces the format change by beginning a countdown in the count field For example if each frame has a duration of 100 microseconds a format change 5 milliseconds in the future begins in 50 frames The count field in each subsequent frame would read 50 49 48 and so on The receiver tracks this countdown but also knows the duration of each frame and decrements its internal counter at the appropriate time whether it receives a frame or not As long as the receiver successfully receives even one frame during the countdown it will reach zero at the intended time If the transmitter does not wish to schedule a reconfiguration it can repeatedly transmit a large constant value in the count field Each received frame will reset the countdown timer and no reconfiguration will occur This practice doubles as a watchdog timer in the case where synchronization is lost if the receiver loses reception for an extended period of time it will automatically switch to the format specified in the last received frame In a cognitive radio for example this allows the transmitter to specify a backup format in the event of some unexpected interference Note that the receiver strips the R3 header both the format and count fields and only passes the frame data to downstream blocks 4 N bits 0--16 bits 16 bits Figure 8 Frame format for rapid runtime reconfig Configuration interface for R3 The host may not be fast enough to reconfigure the transmitter and/or receiver quickly enough to avoid loosing a significant amount of data A nontrivial amount of computation is required to determine the appropriate values for all the configuration registers On the other hand putting sufficient intelligence for reconfiguration into the FPGA firmware would be prohibitively complex A compromise is reached by having the host pre-compute all the register values and load them into a buffer The buffer contains a sequence of reconfiguration instructions consisting of an address and a data The FPGA firmware then generates a trigger to quickly execute all the instructions in the buffer The trigger is based on the R3 count field Once R3 reaches zero both the transmitter and receiver start the reconfiguration simultaneously A block diagram showing the host and the buffer is shown in Figure 9 Note that the host interface always has priority over the bus since there's no mechanism for reporting a pre-empted transfer The command buffer monitors the bus and injects commands only when the host is idle Host I Commad Transceiver Buffer start trigger Figure 9 Command buffer interface for R3 R3 Locking Behavior The rapid reconfiguration described above can take thousands of clock cycles and will typically cause the receiver to lose lock The transition from one format to the next cannot be easily scheduled to occur over just one sample The datapath in both transmitter and receiver is highly pipelined i.e the downstream blocks are processing older samples while the upstream blocks have already started processing new samples A seamless transition between the formats would require each of the blocks to be configured instantaneously and in a very precise sequence The sequencing would have to be precise to within a clock cycle This precision would be very difficult to achieve in general and especially since the configuration logic runs at a lower clock frequency than the signal processing logic Therefore at least one frame will be lost during the reconfiguration Typically a loss of lock is declared after missing unlock after consecutive frame headers and a lock is declared after seeing lock after consecutive frame headers Since the reconfiguration is known to cause a loss of lock the lock status should be reset at the start of the reconfiguration sequence This will allow the synchronization logic to immediately start looking for a new synch pattern and save the loss of unlock after frames In addition the timing tracking will unlock if the data rate in the new format differs from the previous format However the phase tracking should remain valid Invalid timing tracking output can cause the phase tracking to unlock if the decision directed phase error detector is used Therefore the phase tracking loop should be frozen at the beginning of the reconfiguration process and released at the end 5 


5 MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM The VLC media player provides the video codec subsystem 7 This highly flexible open-source player integrates the video encoding streaming and decoding interfaces The player can be controlled via a Telnet connection providing the necessary automation interface to the DBRA controller The encoder captures raw data from a high-end webcam and encodes it into one of the supported formats The format selected for this research effort is H.264 a standard for video conferencing 8 This format can be configured for a wide range of data rates from a few dozen kbps to few Mbps The encoded data is streamed over the RTP/UDP 9 interface on the local computer A UDP client captures the packets and passes them to the transmitter If the UDP data rate exceeds the throughput of the waveform selected at the transceiver UDP packets are dropped After passing through the transmitter channel and the receiver the UDP packets are reconstructed by a UDP server The UDP server then streams the UDP packets on the receiver computer The UDP packets generated by the VLC include sufficient information about the video codec for the receiver to process them without any side-channel input Therefore the DBRA controller communicates video compression changes only to the transmitter-side VLC application TCP/IP Hardware Testbed Software defined radio opens a wide range of exciting opportunities No longer is a wireless link designed for the worst-case conditions only Instead the available bandwidth is optimally utilized over a range of conditions The average throughput and therefore average user experience is significantly improved This improvement comes at a cost of additional complexity at multiple layers of the communications protocol stack A designer must be aware of the ramifications of physical layer changes on the network and even application layers The design of the adaptive physical layer and video codec infrastructure is rather involved Initial results with usercontrolled DBRA events have been obtained A high data rate 4 Mbps physical link is first established and high quality low compression video stream is sent The high quality video frame grab is shown in Figure 11 The physical link bandwidth is then reduced to 64kbps Video data packets are now necessarily dropped resulting in very dramatic degradation in video quality Large portions of the image have been corrupted as shown in Figure 12 The video compression is then adjusted to match the physical layer throughput The resulting video stream is now less sharp but clearly superior to the previous case as can be seen in Figure 13 Adjusting the data rate at the application layer is therefore an important aspect of the DBRA system Without this link real-time applications cannot take advantage of conditions better than the worst case satellite link worst case terminal mobility and worst case traffic demand dynamics Taking advantage of the dynamic allocation of satellite resources requires coordination between all network layers including mechanisms for physical layer mode change link layer bandwidth allocation network layer QoS capabilities and application layer changes to data rate Figure 10 Video subsystem block diagram 6 6 CONCLUSION

The comparison results are \nshown in Table 5.   \n \n \nTable 5: Comparison of “Straight-Forward Leveling \nScheme with MACHETE Simulation for ISE Option-1 \n \nThe above comparison indicates that the straight-forward” \nleveling scheme is a close approximation to the Qualnet \ndirect simulation in the case when the bulk science latency \nrequirement is relatively small \(one hour estimation results generated by the analytical \nleveling approach can be used in costing of the architecture noptions11.    \n \nThe end-to-end traffic flow simulations reveal the following \ninteresting facts:   \n1. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the GSS-INOC links are real-\ntime bit streams and the link sizes are driven by the ninstantaneous aggregated data rates.   \n\t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
