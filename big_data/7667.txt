Using BP neural network theory, select the actual production data as training samples and the main elements of 
alloy additions as input data. There are 4 layers in this model namely input layer, hidden layer and output layer 
 VC  language is adopted to develop program which is tried on in production site, the prediction accuracy of established network model hits more than 95%. The result shows that the predition method has good accuracy and effectivly solved the big problem of relationship between product composition and alloy addition and can automaticly choose the request of alloy addition for a given product ingredients Keywords-modeling; ne ural network; converter smelting; alloy addition I   
I NTRODUCTION  As there are many factors influence the converter steelmaking ingredients,and the smelting process is difficult to describe by a precise mathematical model, also the choose of smelting parameters largely depend on operator's experience and knowledge that greatly influence the stability of finished steel composition. It is difficult to fit the current demand of wide variety of steel smelting and shortened production cycle In this case, the steel plant developed the process rules for general processess according to its own condition, which could facilitate the parameters choosen for the operators. But these rules are discrete data that can only reflect part of the 
relationship between the process parameters and the effects, not combined relationship. The parameter list and curve can not meet the product requirements in a timely manner. Thus many scholars and engineers at home or abroad have done a substantial amount of research on the steel-making process and achieved some results 1. In this paper, a silicon, Si-Mn alloy weight neural networks \(NN\ model is established to solve the problems of alloy addition in smelting.The model can draw hidden knowledge that is difficult to describe by language from the production data, and automaticly select alloy accession volume. The data of smelting HRB400 steel is taken 
as calculation example for ditail discuss II  D ECISION MAKING PROCESS  As many factors in converter steel-making process are difficult to quantify, and it\222s hard to obtain accurate real-time detection information, this determines the process can not adjust the volume continuous.Under the maturity of end point temperature control, the control of alloy addition is big problem that directly impact the quality, productivity and economic efficiency of steel. Alloy addition is the prediction amount of silicon alloys and Si-Mn alloys in a static model under determined blowing conditions and product composition and according to the result to adjust the addition of raw 
materials in time. The accurate prediction of alloy addition before smelting plays a guiding role in decision-making, and effectively raises the hit rate of steel composition 5  III  N EURAL N ETWORKS MODEL  Neural Networks \(NN\ technology is modelling method that does not rely on strict mathematical model. Neural network model is a large-scale distributed parallel processing system with strong self-organizing, self-learning abilities and high degree of non-linear dynamics mapping function, suitable for those with high uncertainty or non-linear control object.The data are highly nonlinear in smelting process as there are many 
parameters, and the relationships between parameter itself and the effect are complex. It is difficult to establish a rigorous mathematical model to describe the laws of smelting process However, using actual production data to establish NN model for alloy addition can effectively solve the problem A  Modeling for Alloy Addition The model-building process for alloy addition including the establishment of samples database, learning module, choosing technical parameters module etc.. Figure 1 is the flow chart for each module and their relationships 1  sample database In order for the model can be used in 
actual manufacturing, sample database is developed from production data collected in smelting of different types of steel Besides,with the smelting conditions change, the sample may not reflect the current state of production accurately, the database also need to redeveloped. So this is an open database it can be continuously enriched, improved and stored in manufacturing in the future Supported by GuiZhou science and technology foundation project: [2008  2040 1

               Figure 1  Flow chart of NN model 2  expert knowledge acquisition module The learning of smelting is a process of obtaining structural parameters for the model that reflect the relationships of process parameters product composition and alloy addition from technical data and smelting samples by expert knowledge acquisition module. The module is based on Levenberg - Marquardt optimization theory, reflect the non-linear relationships which are externalized by weight and threshold of neural network. Then the knowledge is modeled. This model of knowledge is not fixed, it can re-learning and obtaining corresponding model parameters with the condition changes or the content of knowledge updating in the process  3  Process parameters selecting moduleor According to confirmation of parameters that impact silicon and Si-Mn alloys addition in the actual process, the alloys parameters selecting module is established to calculate the actual amount The module has the ability to think as skilled operators and can simulate the decision-making process through expert knowledge acquisition module\222s learning. Of course, the choice depends on the parameters selecting module, but the decision-making ability constrainted by knowledge acquisition module and process database. As a result, a comprehensive database of process and high-performance knowledge acquisition module are needed to support a good parameters selecting module B  The Structure of NN Model There are many factors that affect the addition of ferrosilicon and Si-Mn alloy, according to the survey and testing in the plant, also taking the converter smelting conditions and the actual needs into account, 16 main factors are determined, such as liquid iron, steel scrap, pig iron, Si-Mn and the composition of C, Si, Mn of end point etc Ferrosilicon, Si-Mn alloys selecting module is established by using neural network technology with the topology structure 16-3-4-2, as it is shown in Figure 2  Figure 2  Structure of NN model C  The Learning Algorithm The learning algorithm of neural network determines the ease of knowledge acquisition and its performance. The conventional learning rule of BP network is Delta rule which is using the negative gradient value of error to adjust the threshold. that can adopt BP algorithm to compute 6  Though BP neural network is the most widely used artificial method, there are still some flaws: \(1\ the convergence is too slow; \(2\es not guarantee the global minimum point of convergence. We improved the BP algorithm to overcome its inherent defects, so as to enhance the speed and accuracy of the calculation when using gradient descent method, the error surface is narrow, this influences convergence rate and easy to gain minimum point partly 7-8 In order to speed up the pace of training and avoid local minimum point, the role error gradient and the trends of the error surface are considered, we add the momentum item in the algorithm 9, 10 to smooth the dramatic changes in gradient direction when the network modified the weight value    1  n X n ji j ji 2 002 003 004\005 002 006    006  Where: Xj -the input value from weights learning rate  momentum factor\(0 ~ l\.From the formula we can see that once j X 004\005 0, the value of weight still changed, which is equivalent to momentum multiplied by the changing of original weight. In other words, the vector of weight value continues to move along the direction of the last step, that avoid local minimum point In the gradient algorithm, the learning rate is a fixed constant, its value will have a direct impact on network training performance. If it is too large , it will reduce the stability of network, too small, it will lead to long training time. If the learning rate changes properly, it will speed up the training and ensure the stability. The algorithm is that, firstly to calculate output error, and then calculate the weight and threshold value after training to gain the real time output error If the ratio of the output error and the previous one is greater than pre-defined parameters, reducing the learning rate.

  4.2. Testing Research Issue 2 Adoption Lifecycle Phases  The interviewees were asked to comment and illustrate the importance of the aforesaid adoption lifecycle phases based on the EAI project. Initially all the interviewees agreed that these phases are very important. For example SDE reported that  yes these phases are very important with a perfect breakdown and we faced these phases in EAI project   Whereas, HIT reported that  proposal and adoption decision phases are vital and are the physical aspects whereas motivation and conception are not inevitably physical aspects unless you got a fairly refined strategic approach to what you want to do   SDM stated that before the motivation phase they also faced external driver phase in the project LGA_A was driven by some external influences e.g pressure from central government to improve their service delivery. Due to such influences, LGA_A was motivated to run a pilot project. In addition, the senior development support engineer and the HIT stated that they faced another phase before the proposal phase such as the discussion phase and the research phase respectively. After discussing on these phases with the interviewees, it appears that both have the same underlying meaning i.e  before adoption decision phase we may have research phase by research this we mean that we do some sort of discussions to run a pilot case study and this could be before the proposal phase. The reason to bring this phase before proposal is that if we need resources that actually enable us to do the pilot study, then we might need to take the decision to get the money to do it   After analysing all the interviews, the authors noted that external driver phase can be same as motivation phase. The reason is that an organisation may be motivated to take a step when it is either influenced internally due to some problem or externally through some stakeholders influence Whereas, the discussion or research phase may also be the same as proposal phase. The rationale is that in proposal phase e.g. the departments making decisions to adopt technology need to some sort of research and provide substantiated reasons for approval from the organisation based on the research, besides this the departments need to analyse their requirements and assess their capabilities for acquiring a technology Thus, the interviewees were asked to illustrate the importance of the adoption lifecycle phases. The importance of each phase is presented in Table 2  Table 2: Importance of Adoption Lifecycle Phases  Adoption Lifecycle Phases HIT SDE SDM Motivation  Conception  Proposal    Adoption Decision   4.3. Testing Research Issue 3 Mapping EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases  Before commencing on the mapping of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases, the interviewees were explained how to perform the mapping Thereafter, the interviewees were asked to map the factors influencing EAI adoption on different phases of the adoption lifecycle. The interviewees went through a rigorous thinking process and mapped the factors \(based on its influence\ each phase of the adoption lifecycle. Table 3 illustrates the results of the mapping of factors for motivation phase only The factors with less \(i.e. one interviewee supporting and other two not\ and no \(i.e. none of the interviewees supporting\ support are discarded. The reason is that these factors had less influence or did not influence on a specific phase. On the other hand factors with full \(i.e. all three interviewees supporting\ and moderate \(i.e. two interviewees supporting and third not supporting\ support are utilised for further empirical research  Table 3: Summarising the Factors with Full or Moderate Support on the Motivation Phase  Motivation Phase  Factors HIT SDE SDM PF Project Champion    Citizen s Satisfaction    Critical Mass    TF IT Sophistication    Data Security and Privacy    SP Top Management Support    Higher Administrative Authority    FF Return on Investment    OF Benefits    Size    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 4.4. Testing Research Issue 4 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 1 validates the factors using Miles and Huberman w h erea s, T a ble 3 illustrates th e  mapping of factors on the motivation phase of the adoption lifecycle. However, these tables do not illustrate the important of each factor on the adoption lifecycle phases. This section introduces AHP technique to prioritise the importance of factor influencing EAI adoption. Table 4 illustrates the global weights-based prioritisation of factors for example on only motivation phase \(due to the constraints on length of the paper, the authors did not include the prioritisation results of other three adoption lifecycle phases\ These weights are obtained by using the Expert Choice \(EC\ software and the conclusions drawn from them are the final results of the analysis of collective judgements provided by the panel of interviewees selected for LGA_A. The results presented in these tables do not mean that any factor is unimportant. It merely exhibits interviewees perceptions on the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases  Table 4: Prioritising the Importance of Factors on the Motivation Phase  Prioritising Factors on the Motivation Phase Factor Categories Factors Prioritisation Result TF IT Sophistication 1\ 0.5963 SF Top Management Support 1\ 0.5963 PF Project Champion 2\ 0.5146 OF Benefits 3\ 0.4583 PF Citizen s Satisfaction 4\ 0.3568 OF Size 5\ 0.2083 PF Critical Mass 6\ 0.1293 TF Data Security and Privacy 7\ 0.0704 SF Higher Administrative Authority 7\ 0.0704 FF Return on Investment 8\ 0.0000  5. Discussions and Revision of the Model  According to the empirical findings, only two factors were not validated i.e. formalisation and evaluation framework. The reasons are: \(a\GA_A did not follow any formal procedure to assess EAI technological solution and \(b\ no evaluation framework was used to assess EAI technological solution but relied on the software vendor. Other factors have either directly or indirectly influenced the decision making process for EAI technological solution adoption. On the other hand, six new factors were identified such as \(a data consistence and project delivery timescale as internal pressure factors b stakeholder s pressure and competition as external pressure factors, \(c stakeholder s support as a support factors, and \(d central government grants  as a financial factor. Four new adoption lifecycle phases were also identified from the empirical findings from LGA_A: [\(a external driver and/or \(b driving force c discussion and/or \(d research phase  tern al driv e r or d r iv ing  f o rce ph a s e are prior to the motivation phase, discussion and or research phases are prior to the proposal phase whereas, adoption decision phase was also reported with a different term i.e investment phase. The findings illustrate that the role of factors, adoption lifecycle phases, mapping of factors and prioritising the importance EAI adoption factors on the adoption lifecycle phases had high importance during EAI adoption process in LGA_A Thus, the authors propose that while exploring EAI adoption in LGAs a\actors, \(b\ lifecycle phases, \(c\mapping of factors and \(d\oritising the importance of factors on the adoption lifecycle phases provides a deeper understanding of interrelationships within LGAs. In doing so, the revised proposed EAI adoption model may: \(a\ercome IT infrastructure limitations within LGAs, \(b\mprove the level of analysis and \(c\upport LGAs when adopting EAI  6. Conclusions  LGAs are complex organisations and are managed by the consent and rules set by the central government. They are influenced by other government authorities and ministries, and their IS adoption involve distributed decision-making based on a division of control and powers [17, 39   Conversely, private organisations have direct and undivided power over decisions and flexible management style with inter-departmental teams working in central coordination T h is  distinction illustrates that LGAs have a bureaucratic nature and are committed to outdated cultural values Such characteristics emphasize risk aversion and insist that structures enhance control rather than connected thinking with silos in LGAs, let alone between them reov er, each L G A dis p la y s  differences in the way: \(a\eir business processes are implemented to provide citizen services, and \(b makes its decisions that differs a lot from other private organisations h es e th eoris e d conceptions distinguish LGAs from other sectors EAI represents an attractive proposition to LGAs, since EAI offers the opportunity to leverage the systems into a seamless chain of processes and present a unified view of their information [12, 28  When such leveraging and presentation occurs, LGAs Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


  may capitalise on their opportunities offered by LGA initiatives \(e.g. e-Government\se then they may efficiently interact with their citizens and other stakeholders on a consistent basis w e v e r EAI is an emerging area within LGAs, thus, there remains an absence of theoretical models, which means there is still a case for the identification of factors that affect the decision making process for EAI adoption and identification of adoption lifecycle phases, with the development of empirically validated underpinnings argued, justified and presented in this paper. The authors sought to address the established voids by proposing a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The model takes into consideration the parame ters that were identified in the normative literature as influencing factors and adoption lifecycle phases. The proposed conceptual model is novel as it includes: \(a\e model consists of a set of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A and incorporates factors identified separately in previous studies. These factors are used for the developing an EAI adoption model in LGAs, \(b\e model incorporates adoption lifecycle phases Empirical findings illustrate that LGA_A passed through these phases while adopting EAI, \(c\e model assimilates the mapping of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases, and \(d\e model incorporates the prioritisation \(importance\ EAI adoption factors in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases The model can be used as a tool for decisionmaking to support LGAs and allow decision makers and researchers to understand and analyse EAI adoption. The concepts of the proposed model can be used for the adoption of inter-organisational IS since such systems should focus on integrated technologies and infrastructures. An interpretive, qualitative case study approach was selected to conduct this research It is not the intention of this paper to offer prescriptive guidelines to EAI adoption but rather describe case study perspectives that allow other researchers to relate their experiences to those reported. Hence, offering a broader understanding of the phenomenon of EAI adoption in LGAs Therefore, the lessons learnt are a result of the description provided and do not seek to be prescriptive. These lessons are summarised below Lesson 1 The practical implications of the mapping of factors on adoption lifecycle phases are  this process can support in better understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs. This is vital as it can also support the managements  decision-making process while introducing EAI Lesson 2 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases can further enhance the decision making process in LGAs. During the mapping of factors, the importance of factors was not recognised Prioritising the factors can assist LGA officials in realising and understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs Lesson 3 Findings on the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases reflect that each interviewee from LGA_A has relatively different conception while mapping the factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases. This may also illustrate that within different LGAs interviewees understanding, knowledge and ability to comprehend the importance of factors may differ Lesson 4 Findings related to the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors cannot be generalised as they may also differ from one LGA to the other Hitherto, the authors highlighted the individual elements of the contributions and research novelty presented in this paper. However, at the wider context this research aimed to enhance the technical decision making process while adopting EAI technologies in LGAs. This was achieved by proposing and validating a novel model \(Figure 1 for EAI adoption in the practical arena \(LGA_A The key beneficiaries are the decision makers and practitioners within LGAs, and researchers within the academic community. All of these benefit from the research in this paper as a guideline to analyse and understand EAI adoption in LGAs. In doing so this research work significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in the areas of EAI and the local government domain by providing sufficient support to the decision makers in speeding up the EAI adoption process in LGAs   7.
