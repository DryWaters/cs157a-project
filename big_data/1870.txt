 Index Terms- Radio frequency identification, RFID Middleware, Data filtration, Data security, Data compression 
 RFID is a generic technology concept that refers to the use of radio waves to identify objects. RFID is a non-contact interrogation method for identification of objects. An RFID system essentially consists of three parts 
I INTRODUCTION 
the RFID tag itself, the RFID reader device, and a backend information management system. The RFID tag consists of a silicon chip that can hold a certain amount of data \(such as a unique identification number\, and an antenna that is used to communicate with the remote reader device. The reader device communicates with the RFID tag by means of sending and receiving radio frequency waves    Many of us are unaware of the fact that we are surrounded with applications of radio frequency identification \(RFID\. It has affected our daily lives in many different aspects. RFID developed and improved fast during 1970s and 80s. More applications took place in the 1980s 
Most common implementations during decade were tracking of animals and vehicles. RFID was also used in factory automation F ID c a n  be used in supply chain to improve inventory control. The use of RFID should greatly reduce the level of shrinkage that occurs in the supply chain by providing increased visibility of individual cases of product. [14   These applications provide security, safety and convenience. We can use RFID in preventing auto and merchandise theft, collecting tolls without stopping managing traffic, controlling access to buildings, gates and more. So RFID technology has been widely adopted for supply chain management purposes. Its inherent 
identification capabilities provide the opportunity to trace products from the producer to the retailer, offering insight to the various levels of the supply chai    I n a w o r d  t h e  introduction of RFID changed the data gathering mode rather than the Application Business 
B Introduction of  RFID Middleware 
 With the development of RFID applications, the rapidly increasing number of companies actively participated in the RFID system development and the increasing sales record of RFID systems and the RFID devices which adopt the different communications protocol. Facing the various applications of RFID, the enterprises meet the first question 
that is how to make the existing information system to connect the RFID reader.  The essence of the question is the interface between the application system and hardware of RFID. So, the key is how to get the accurate data and ensure the reliability of the data. The traditional method of Application to Application is to use middleware. In a similar way, the solution of middleware architecture is the core technology RFID Middleware is a new breed of software system which facilitates data communication between automatic identification equipments like RFID readers and enterprise applications. Recently, the development of RFID Middleware technology has become very active in various 
fields such as manufacturing companies and material flow systems. Also, the researches for RFID Middleware systems have been performed continuously and the related software packages have appeared in the market. The rapidly increasing number of companies actively participated in the RFID system develop and the increasing sales record of RFID systems show the importance of RFID middleware systems.[4 Fi g  1 s h o w s R FI D Mi d d l e w a r e Sy st e m  Architecture 2565 


 Fig .1  RFID middleware System Architecture  RFID Middleware systems receive tag data from variable RFID readers that identify and read RFID tag and collect, filter, and a group of tag data to transmit the processed tag data to application program such as WMS ERP. The responsibility of RFID Middleware systems is to collect and filter the r eceived tag data, and deliver the filtered tag data to applications programs. In RFID system the middleware is a sort of software that resides between the RFID readers and enterprise applications. The middleware takes the raw data from the reader, filter it and passes on the useful event data to back-end systems. Tag data that middleware handles can be information that is involved in individual's privacy, or has important value of corporations  T h e s e c o n d f i n g e r s h o w t h e f u n c t i o n s o f R F ID  Middleware    Fig. 2 the functions of RFID Middleware  The heart of the utility is that RFID makes gathering information about physical objects easy. Middleware plays a key role to deliver tag data in real time, which resides between readers and enterprise applications in RFID Systems. Therefore, the data management of RFID Middleware is very important. This paper emphasized this model which is shown in Fig. 3      Fig.3  RFID Middle Data management model  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the background of the RFID Middleware Section 3 introduces the improvement of transposition cipher adopted by RFID Middleware to increase the data security. Section 4 introduces RFID Middleware using the compression algorithm in order that RFID tag can store more data. Section 5 tests the performance of RFID middleware Finally, In Section 6   concludes s this paper   II THE BACKGROUND OF RFID MIDDLEWARE  Sun, IBM, BEA, SAP, Oracle, i-Konect, etc. introduced their RFID Middleware products. And some research groups also propose their solutions, such as the E-Business Technology Institute \(ETI\ of the University of Hong Kong Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, etc. SUN-MEE PARK proposed that the RFID Middleware system supporting priority service with the Buffer Management Component consists of the Reader Interface Component, the Buffer Management Component the ALE Component and the EPCIS Component. Buffer management component consists of the buffers that buffer the received tag data and the buffer manager that gives the different priorities to the buffers in processing the tag data in the buffers. Also, the buffer manager provides the time managing, priority managing and data size managing functions. [6   Each RFID Middleware has respective characteristics But they donêt deal the RFID tag data in terms of data security and compression to increase the quantity of storing data III THE RESEARCH OF RFID MIDDLEWAREêS DATA SECURITY  Although many methods were introduced to guarantee to data security of RFID tag, most of them come down to the hardware.[7 F r o m th e v i ew o f s o f t w a r e  w e u s e t h e authentication of RFID reader and the method of data encryption. The authentication of RFID reader which is the first security safeguard is to defend the RFID data which canêt be identified by the wrongful reader ,that can be achieved by giving the reader a label of çright:é item, which write the right of RFID reader. When the RFID reader send the request of reading the RFID tag, the RFID Middleware firstly verify the right of reader, if the çrighté item is  one the reader can read the RFID tag, or the reader is rejected and closed. The data encryption protects the RFID data which can be identified by the unlawful reader. The mechanism of data encryption can be described as follows 8       D E K C P S   1  P  expresses the space of plaintext   C  expresses the space of ciphertext  K  is the key or the space of key E  is Encryption Algorithm D  is Decryption Algorithm If the key is K, the Encryption and Decryption Algorithm can be used by E k and D k then  Cryptosystem can be described as follows        K K K D E K C P S  2   P E C K  3 2566 


     P E D C D P K K K   4 1  K E is  the Inverse Function of K E 1 1 and     K K K K D E E D 5 Equation 3 shows that P is encrypted by the E k to equal ciphertext C Equation 4 show C is decrypted by the D k to equal plaintext P The classical encryption Algorithm has two type replacement encryption and transposition encryption. The replacement encryption is to replace the char of plaintext by the other char, number and so on, but the position of each char is not changed. The transposition encryption is to disorder the plaintext and the chars are not changed. In other words, the plaintext can be input a picture and the other order chars are output shown in Fig. 4  Fig. 4  the description of Encryption Algorithm Because the capacity of tag is limited, the store space of the ciphertext is must be considered and it is possible that the key table is very big in order to reduce the query speed So this system adopted improved the transposition encryption and used two step encryption. The first step is the transposed transposition encryption. The string can be encrypted by the transposition and one M X 4 matrix is built in which M based on the capacity of tag, for example the capacity of tag is 256 chars, then M=256/4=64 according the transposition encryption, the ciphertext C 1 can be accepted. The second step is binary transpos ition encryption that makes each binary char of C 1 invert order transposition encryption. For example the ASCII of çré is 114, the binary of r is ç01110010é, then inversed 01110010é and the other binary ç01001110é can be obtained. The decimal number is 78, which is the char of Né. Repeated the procedure, the full string can be encrypted as shown in Fig. 5 Fig.5 the encrypted string process IV THE RESEARCH OF RFID MIDDLEWAREêS DATA COMPRESSION The data compression can be mainly divided loseless compression and losssy compression. To ensure the security of data, we must adopt the loseless compression which wipes off the redundancy information and doesnêt influence the information entropy, at the same time ,the compressed information can be recovered. The target is to wipe off the maximum of removing redundancy information[9  T h e r e  are many data compression algorithm. In RFID Middleware software, on account of efficiency\( both space and time there is a need to keep the data in compressed form for as much as possible, even when it is being searched. So we selected the Lzw compression algorithm. A string table must be built to store the data. If the other data matches the data stored string table, the index of string table can be output. Because of the index bytes less than the bytes of fact data that increases the compression rate. The string table neednêt transport with the data and is dynamic generation   The compression algorithm can be described as follows step1 initialization build a string table step2  read the first input char set the prefix    string f  step3   read the next char  if\( no char output f char, exit if f x exist in string table f x  f repeat Step3 Else  if f x not exist in string table  output f char   f x can be added to S string table x  f repeat Step3 LZW compression algorithm data flow can be described as follows  Fig.6  LZW compression algorithm data flow VT HE PERFORMANCE TEST OF RFID  MIDDLEWARE 2567 


 After we finished the RFID Middleware software we built a simple testing environment  The hardware environment as follows  TABLE I T HE HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT RFID device IF4 and IF5 of internec XCRF-500 of Yuanwanggu  host CPU>=1.0G memory>=256M hard disk>=20G os Windows XP Professional N et  10  100M application WMS  The WMS using the DLL of RFID Middleware had finished the input and output of whole pallet and the testing performance has The Stability testing of system  The control test of system The reading and accurate rate of RFID tag The security testing of RFID tag The data compression testing The result of testing  Run two hours, the system worked properly and use few CPU and memory The number of input and output whole pallet is 50 The reading accurate rate is 100% and this system can update the right data  The data compression function is proper VI C ONCLUSION RFID is the hottest spot of current research. It can be used in wide area, including logistics, guard system ticket management, airline express, mobile business automatization etc. Many industries are absorbed in the RFID product and application, the RFID Middleware becomes very important. But the data security and compression is a problem. This paper used two two-double method to protect the data in tag-labels One is the verification of the reader and the other is data encryption. Because of the capacity of tag, this paper used two-step encryption and improved the data security. We proposed the method of data compression for some special areas. We can use tagês memory more sufficient and save the cost for applications  R EFERENCE 1  G a r y M  G a u k l e r  R F ID  in s u p p l y c h a i n  A d is s e r t a t io n s u b m it te d  to the department of management science and engineering and the committee on graduate studies of Stanford university .

In this scenario, H 1 uses NMAP to detect whether FTP service is running on target hosts  Result  During the experiment, we observe that in scenario 1 \(figure 6 snort generates an alert with 193.95.66.10  as IP address of attacker and 2356 as port source; but this address corresponds to a router\222s extern interface. Whereas our IPS/IDS architecture does the correspondence between the two address 193.95.66.10 and 10.0.1.2 the two port numbers \(assigned port 2356 and 5987 nd formulates an alert with the appropriate value   Figure 6.

In this scenario, we emulate a DoS attack using an snort is incapable to determine the victim since its alert specifies 193.95.66.11  as victim\222s identifier. However, our identification module successfully determines that the attack is directed to the host 10.0.1.9 running the web server   Scenario 3 Attack using worm launched against different private hosts  Result In scenario 3 \(figure 8\e remark that not only snort but also our IPS/IDS architecture failed to identify the victims. In fact, this failure is not due to the identification module\222s performance decrease but due to the absence of the connections\222 characteristic in the NAT table. When a remote host launches connections containing worm, the NAT router cannot determine the target host since the port/address and their assigned values are undefined in the NAT table and the destination address in packet header corresponds to its interface address. In this case, the object graph update cannot be constructed. This scenario underlines the need to use not only IPS/IDS system but different security devices as antivirus and firewall in order to form a global security layer   Figure 8. Experimental result of scenario 3 VI  C ONCLUSION  NAT provide a way to handle IP address depletion incrementally. However, IDS/IPS must be re-examined to function correctly within NAT. In this paper, we have fully integrated the NAT\222s modification done on packets headers within the IDS/IPS analysis process in order to correctly identify the entities implicated in security issues. Our experiments have shown that utilizing a NAT-aware IDS/IPS system permits to identify the real attacker/victim, launch the adequate response actions with respect to the attacker/victim characteristics and improve the protection of the network Future work will include more interest at finding relationships among alerts generated by IDS/IPS systems deployed below and above the NAT device R EFERENCES  1  Shiuh-Pyng Shieh, Fu-Shen Ho, Yu-Lun Huang, And Jia-Ning Luo 223Network Address Translators: Effects on Security Protocols and Applications in the TCP/IP Stack\224.

  9 corrections. With several concurrent development processes, ops personnel could be members of more than one virtual team simultaneously. Various strategies such as sequence specific email aliases and automated software configuration were devel oped to ease confusion from sequence to sequence Aftermarket and SOP Update 227Since the initial round of integration and implementation was begun two years before reaching Saturn, a two-step update phase was included to incorporate new discoveries, respond to instrument performance changes, and design to the latest navigation ephemerides. The record of planned activities from SOP was retained in the CIMS database. During Aftermarket, the previous integration was revisited and revised. SOP Update during which the commanding for pointing and for management of shared resources such as power and data volume was reworked and revalidated, followed Aftermarket Sequencing 227 The final sequence development phase Science and Sequence Update Process \(SSUP began 10 weeks before start of execu tion. The commanding carried forward from SOPU received its final refinements and validation. Instrument internal commanding was added during this stage of development, expanding the roster of participants as the focus shifted from science design to instrument operation. The vector commands for attitude control were also generated and merged into the sequence providing the first realistic estimate of sequence size Since the sequence contains tens of thousands of commands, ensuring its validity was laborious. Because the command sequence represents merged commanding from each of the instruments a nd from each of the spacecraft subsystems, configuration ma nagement was required to insure that all parties were aware of changes potentially impacting them and that no changes were made without appropriate validation. Late in this stage of development changes were restricted to those related to maintaining flight assets health and safety. Novel or particularly complex activities were simulated in one or more of the available testbeds. The highest fide lity modeling was accomplished with a hardware-in-the-loop simulator, the Integrated Test Laboratory \(ITL\with engineering versions of the flight processors and flight software the same as on-board the spacecraft Over the lengthy time to plan the activities and develop the commands, the precise timing of geometric opportunities sometimes shifted. Several constructs to accommodate those shifts were introduced. In the one employed during SSUP called a ground movable block, a cluster of observations was shifted together within a window to reflect a timing change in a key event such as closest approach to a body Execution 227Uplink of the background sequence and the loads of instrument expanded blocks required several DSN passes since the files were large and had to be verified once on board. Days that included other Earth-pointed activity such as OTMs were avoided. This expanded the overlap of the old and new background sequences over enough days that careful memory management was required to fit both in onboard memory. In some cases, the new sequence was too large and needed to be split in to two pieces with the second uplinked as the first piece neared completion Once the sequence was executi ng, additional real-time commands and mini-sequences were uplinked for timing adjustments, OTMs, and other engineering activities requiring state verification be fore issuance. Instrument internal commands could be also be uplinked directly without involvement of the sequence team at JPL using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP During execution, there were two ways of accommodating late changes to timing or geometry. One, a live moveable block, was similar to the ground version except that the size of the timing shift was not determined until after the sequence had begun executing. The other, called a live vector update, redirected the pointing in inertial space by redefining the vectors that control attitude. Although this was a straightforward mechanism for altering pointing in response to later, better knowledge of spacecraft position the process took several days and considerable effort. So extensive analysis was require d to carefully place potential updates where they could be most effective 6  L ESSONS L EARNED  Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed in overcoming those challenges should be of value to other deep space science missions, including the next Outer Planets flagship mission. Some of the lessons cover design decisions, both those that facilitated operations and should be carried forward for future consideration and those that complicated operations and should be avoided Others reflect ways in which flight experience differed from expectations. The discussion with resulting recommendations for future missions is divided into three categories: flight system, ground system, and programmatic Flight System Operational modes 227 Spacecraft operational modes were used to define a limited number of power mode states for the instruments and engineering subsystems. The states were developed in conjunction with project science and the engineering office to enable synergistic and cooperative science data collection. The use of operational modes eliminated the need to perform unique thermal modeling on a sequence-by-sequence basis. The thermal and power configurations for each of th e limited number of operational modes were fully tested only once for operational use. As such, there was no need to va lidate and check the power and 


  10 thermal state of the spacecraft during sequence development. However, on a very limited number of occasions, unique power m odes were necessary to accomplish the science data acquisition plan. In these situations, thermal modeling was necessary during sequence development. The a priori restriction on the use of unique power modes was limited to 5% of the total power modes used throughout the mission. In reality, the operational experience was about 1 Telemetry Modes 227 The volume of science data from the instrument is a function of the science data pickup rates specified for each instrument The science instruments can easily exceed the total bandwid th capabilities for the flight system, so the maximum data pickup rates need to be limited depending on the acquisition of the science plan The Cassini mission restricted th e instrument data rates by developing a limited number of telemetry modes where the maximum data pickup rate for each instrument is specified Project science worked with the science teams to develop the data pickup rate for each telemetry mode based on the synergistic science data collection Memory Management 227 The on-board memory management for Cassini significantly simplifies the managing of backgrounds seque nces and mini-sequences The flight software has the capability to run 64 different programs \(sequence, delayed action commands, etc once. This significantly simplifies the development and coordination required for the live updates and OTM processes. Also, the on-board memory management allows for sequences that are too large to fit in the on-board memory to be split into pieces Guidance and Control 227 The AACS subsystem uses an Internal Vector Propagation \(IVP\for pointing the spacecraft at the science targets of interest. The ephemerides for the spacecraft and the various science targets are stored as polynomial vectors and propagated on board the spacecraft for easy retrieval a nd updating. This approach significantly simplifies the ability to perform live pointing vector updates during sequence execution when the spacecraft knowledge to better known. An update to a single vector, or a couple of vectors is all that is needed to correctly target upcoming science observations Command and Data Handling 227 The Command and Data Subsystem \(CDS features that simplified operations. Among these were onboard science instrument data policing, ability to remove bad solid-state recorder \(SSR\odules, and a variety of onboard science modules that control science pointing commands \(e.g., limb scans, ring tracking, mosaics\and their corresponding instrument triggers. One of the more powerful capabilities on-board th e spacecraft was the data policing, which controls the amount of science instrument data that can be recorded on-board the solid state \(SSR recorder. Once data volume wa s allocated to the science instrument teams on a daily basis in the planning process data policing prevented any team from using more data than allocated if compression or instrument internal commanding goes awry. This eliminates any need for ground intervention to prevent SSR overruns during sequence execution High-priority science playback 227 Insuring receipt of highpriority science data in the event of a DSN station problem requires a priori commanding in the background sequence for dual, playbacks of this data. This requires a considerable amount of planning and SSR pointer management and commanding to achieve the protection of this data. A filebased SSR, and/or a CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP capability would have simplifie d the redundant playback of high-priority science data No Scan Platform 227 The lack of a scan platform significantly increased the operations complexity of the mission. Without a scan platform the pointing of the optical remote sensing instruments was coupled with the pointing of the fields and particles instruments. This more than doubled the competition for th e spacecraft pointing. In addition, the total number of pointing constraints \(radiators and boresights\ncreased, dramatically reducing the amount of the 4 002 steradians of the celestial sphere that is available for spacecraft pointing. Th is required significant negotiations of the spacecraft attitude, both primary and secondary, during the science integration and implementation process Navigation 227 The Cassini spacecraft is navigated to a specific B\267T and B\267R for each targeted flyby Fixing the targeted flyby tie points increased the overall delta-V required to fly the mission but significantly simplified the science operations involved with planning the science observations taken with 261 30 minutes from closest approach. The trajectory was allowed to deviate between the targeted flyby tie-points, which required pointing vector updates for science observations outside of the targeted flyby \(see Guidance and Control above for a discussion of live pointing vector updates Another simplified operational approach used by Cassini is the just-in-time development of the Orbit Trim Maneuvers OTMs\e OTMs are built using mini-sequences that are overlaid and executed during the earth-pointed downlink periods planned in the background sequence Ground System  Science Operations System 227 A critical planning tool used to enable distributed operations was the Cassini Information Management System \(CIMS\This tool uses a web-based interface to the Cassini database that contains the current state of the integrated scien ce and engineering plan. CIMS is used throughout the sequencing life cycle on the mission from initial planning through execution. This system allowed the science instrument teams from around the world 


  11 to request, review, and propose changes to the current state of the science plan Distributed Operations 227 Cassini distributed all aspects of the instrument operations to the science teams. Science Teams were required to develop the spacecraft commanding for pointing the spacecraft. Th is significantly complicated the interfaces and coordination required by the JPL science and sequencing teams. The distribution of internal instrument commanding and monitoring instrument health and safety worked well. Dedicated full-time operations personnel were required at all instrument sites. The liaison between the distributed sites and JPL required definition of a strong JPL Investigation Scientist \(i.e., Experiment Representative\le Distributed operations is a two-edged sword. Scientists personally worked operations and were better able to optimize for their science objectives. Their insight provided the feedback necessary to quickly respond to science discoveries in the science selection and uplink processes This allowed the operations team to capitalize on truly extraordinary opportunities to a degree not thought possible However, this was at the cost of doing science analysis and publishing science results Software Development 227 The Cassini mission deferred most of its ground software development until post launch. In fact, considerable effort was spent accelerating the development of the tools required to plan the Jupiter flyby observations in 2001. For the start of the science integration for Cassini\222s prime mission, many of the ground software planning tools were immature or unavailable. To compensate, homegrown tool development occurred at the instrument sites and within science planning. System engineering of these types of ground software tools was lacking. A better paradigm would have been to develop the operations and ground system\222s architecture, requirements models, and software to a level sufficient to support operations pre-launch. Sufficient project resources needed to be applied to Phase B/C/D development. The science planning tools should be developed to a sufficient level during these phases such that th ey can be used as part of evaluating the ground and flight system requirements and capabilities. Based on this evaluation, refinements could be made during cruise and throughout the mission to the unified ground and flight system architecture and software requirements Programmatic  Project Science 227The orbiter consists of 8 Principal Investigator \(PI\struments and 4 Facility Instrument with corresponding Team Leads. In a ddition, there are 5 different science discipline teams: Rings, Saturn, Titan, Icy Satellites and Magnetosphere. The Project Science leader ship needed to be highly involved in the tactical and strategic science planning activities. The consensus building culture used on Cassini was time consuming. The Project Science support staff should be funded adequately to allow the Project Scientist to participate in the integration process. Clear Project Science guidelines are very helpful Instruments 227 Instrument Flight Rule development must be mature pre-launch. Instruments should be designed to minimize impacts on the operations of the other instruments, e.g., radiator placement. Data compression internal to instruments is vital. For Cassini, the science instruments had internal sequencing memory for storing instrument commanding for upcoming sequence. This allowed the science teams th e ability to send real-time noninteractive instrument commands that bypass the sequencing process by using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP  In-flight Testing 227 The targeted gravity assist flybys provided a unique opportunity to exercise the ground system on realistic science data acquisition scenarios that simulates the operational environment during the Tour phase of the prime mission. This also had the advantage of providing the science instrument teams an opportunity to acquire useful science data for the purposes of instrument checkout and science data analysis. The in-flight exercises should use the processes, procedures, software, and ground system capabilities in the same manner, to the extent possible, as will be used during Tour and Orbital operations The entire flight team \(mission planning, science planning sequencing, spacecraft, naviga tion, and science teams should be fully engaged to provide the maximum benefit to the Project 7  C ONCLUSION  Even though Cassini was a NASA flagship mission maximizing the science return was a challenge to science planning operations. Decisions aimed at saving both prelaunch and operations costs added considerable complexity to both the spacecraft and the ground system. Among the key ones were removing the scan platform, opting for distributed operations rather than co-location, and delaying development of some flight software and most of the ground system until after launch Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed to overcome those challenges as presented in this paper should be of value to other deep space science missions.  Future missions should carefully consider the following advice 200  Pay careful attention to operational scenarios in development cost saving decisions, both spacecraft and ground. Additional, more sophisticated commanding constructs may be required in operations to compensate for lack of spacecraft capabilities. Ground management of stressed or

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
