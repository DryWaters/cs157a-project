The Optimized Design of Rijndael Algorithm Based on SOPC  Shunwen Xiao, Yajun Chen, Peng Luo College of Physics and Electronic information China West Normal University Nanchong, China rejoice222@126.com     Abstract  Based on the analysis of the round transformation and key expansion, the Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES algorithm is optimized through the Look-up Table. And then the optimized Rijndael algorithm based on SOPC \(System on a programmable Chip\is design ed and implemented through software and hardware. According to the software design flow chart of the optimized Rijndael algorithm, the program design of the corresponding B table and key generator are completed The testing results are: the hi ghest working frequency is 147 MHz; the biggest data flow is 2382 Mbps. The design of the 
Rijndael algorithm based on "NIOS FPGA" can achieve a higher data processing speed while it occupies relatively low resources. The design has a big breakthrough compared to the traditional FPGA realization Keywords-optimized design; Ri jndael algorithm; SOPC I   I NTRODUCTION  As the new generation AES  cipher algorithm, the Rijndael algorithm has the adva ntages of high efficiency in implementation, low demand for storage, and high speed of encryption and decryption 1 The algorithm can be implemented through software as well as hardware. The software implementation is too slow although it is flexible. It 
is even more so with the block encryption algorithms getting more and more complex. Besides, the security system is difficult to avoid the appearance of the key plaintext in the computer during the implementation through software which may result in the plaintext being stolen or modified On the contrary, the hardware implementation has the advantages of high speed, high reliability and much higher security, so that an increasing number of applications require the implementation through hardware 2]-[4 The key of hardware implementation operates in the interior of module and the algorithm solidifies in the hardware, which can 
guarantee that the key of plaintext doesn  t flow outside and can achieve the true sense of confidentiality. The design based on "NIOS FPGA" project, on the one hand, can configure CPU flexibly according to the application; on the other hand, it can realize the configuration of hardware logic directly in the FPGA interior. The software realization can be used for the peripheral device that has not so high demand for data transmission speed. While for the configuration that requires high speed, it can use the hardware interface to realize directly and then use the software to control it. In this 
paper, the Rijndael algorithm is optimized comprehensively using Look-up Table, and then the algorithm is designed systematically using "NIOS FPGA" project  II  T HE DESIGN OF R IJNDAEL ALGORITHM BASED ON L OOK UP T ABLE  A  The design of round transformation based on Look-up Table In SubBytes, the input high order 4 bits is used as the row value of the S-box, the low order 4 bits is used as the column value of the S-box, then the corresponding row and column

The SubBytes in which each column is 32 bits can use matrix to express as  Eq. \(1      0 0  1 1  2 2  3 3     ii ii ii ii bSb bSb bSb bSb        1 Where b 0,i is the 4-bytes element of the first row in the matrix, S[b 0,i  is the S-bo x Look u p Ta ble o p e r ation on the  
byte element of the matrix In ShiftRows, row 0 is not shif ted; row 1 is shifted to the left by 1 byte cyclically; row 2 by 2 bytes and row 3 by 3 bytes. The ShiftRows transformation can use matrix to express as Eq. \(2   0 0 0  1 1 1  2 2 2  3 3 3     i i i i i i i i b Sb Sb b Sb b Sb b

The standard Altera 32 bits NIOS  embedded CPU provides guarantee for the large and systematic data processing. The system is composed of FPGA, memory and the external interface three parts. In the system, the peripheral circuit and NIOS CPU Soft-Core are integrated to realize the control functions. As the control core of the system, the NIOS CPU Soft-Core needs a 
385 


balance between its resource occupation and function when it is created. The demand of system resources is greatly reduced by the SOPC Builder customization for NIOS  CPU. The FPGA part is built in the FPGA chip, the core is NIOS processor CORE. A lot of data need to be processed in algorithm, so the algorithm round transformation is completed by using NIOS processor CORE and the key generation is conducted by the key generator in FPGA. The external interface of FPGA is a part including some interface devices and circuit modules, which is used for data input / output and display and so on  NIOS II CORE AVALON  Figure 1  The scheme of SOPC system IV  T HE DESIGN OF OPTIMIZED ALGORITHM  The design of optimized algorithm is shown in Fig.2 Initialization 4  4 bytes matrix XOR with the initial key and shift Look up B 0 B 1 B 2 B 3 and shift XOR with round key and shift Last round Look up B 0 B 1 B 2 B 3 and XOR XOR with the final round key The ciphertext YES NO  Figure 2  The design of optimized algorithm A  Table B generation The rapid optimization of Rijndael algorithm is the Lookup Table operation. At first, the Look-up Table should be created. As has been discussed from Eqs. \(5\and \(6\the calculation of each round needs four Look-up Tables, four XORs and three shifts operation. As can be seen from Table B, only Table B 0 needs to be created, the other three Look-up Tables B 1 B 2 and B 3 can be obtained by cyclical shift of the bytes. While the round function Table B 0 can be realized using the S-box and byte multiplication. Table B 0 can be expressed as Eq. \(10\ which each element is one byte 0  03 24  16  8 02 B x S x OR S x OR S x OR S x   10 The algorithm of creation of the round function table B O  is as follows 10  Round \(unsigned long int *b, unsigned long int *k, unsigned long int *e  for\(int i=0 j<4 j  unsigned long int B 0 0,B 1 0,B 2 0,B 3 0 B 0 B[b[4*i B 1 B[b[1+4*\(\(j+l 8 B [b 1+4*\(\(j+l 24   B 2 B[b[2+4*\(\(j+2  6 B [b 2+4*\(\(j+2 1 6   B 3 B[b[3+4*\(\(j+3 4 B[b[3+4*\(\(j+3\%4   8  E[j  B O B 1 B 2 B 3 k   Where *b is the head address of the State matrix, *k points to the head address of the round key of each round. *e returns to the head address of the State matrix after a round transformation, B is the cr eated Ta b l e  B 0  As there is no mix-column for the final round in the round operation in the Rijndael algorithm, it simply needs to change Table B 0 to the S-box B  Key generation According to the initial key \(w \(0\\(1\\(2\and w 3\he key generator ge nerates w \(4\\(43 automatically and stores them in the memory \(complete the memory initialization\ the period of round transformation the quadruple frequency of the round clock is conducted by the frequency multiplier and the counting value is taken as the Look-up Table circuit address. Four Look-up tables are implemented in a round clock period and w 4i+0 w 4i+3 are sent out. At the same time, the 128 bits round key is exported through the serial-in parallel-out shift register. The function description for the key generation circuit is conducted by VHDL and the generated module symbols are shown in Fig.3

The hardware design of the Rijndael algorithm is achieved mainly from the hardware and software implementation. The overall design of the Rijndael algorithm based on SOPC is performed and then the creation of NIOS CPU is completed to form an integrated SOPC system. The testing results show that the design of the Rijndael algorithm based on "NIOS FPGA" can achieve a higher data processing speed while it occupies relatively low resources.

  5 Based on David Keirsey\222s work on Temperament\256, the MBTI\256 results can be broken down into one of four temperaments: Intuitive-Thinking \(NT\Sensing-Judging SJ\sing-Perceiving \(SP\d Intuitive-Feeling \(NF\as shown in Table 11.  The study population had twice as 26%\lowed by SJs \(15%\and one NF \(3%\BTI\256 results for NASA agency-wide SEs in graphic form.  While these findings are interesting, a sample size of 34 is too small to draw any definitive conclusions.  Continued work in this area is being considered Table 5 NASA SE Competency Model \226 Themes and Competencies Top Level Themes Middle Competencies Leadership  Appreciates/Recognizes Others  Builds Team Cohesion  Understands the Human Dynamics of a Team  Creates Vision and Direction  Ensures System Integrity  Possesses Influencing Skills  Sees Situations Objectively  Coaches and Mentors  Delegates  Ensures Resources are Available Attitudes Attributes  Remains Inquisitive and Curious  Seeks Information and Uses the Art of Questioning  Advances Ideas  Gains Respect Credibility, and Trust  Possesses Self-Confidence  Has a Comprehensive View  Possesses a Positive Attitude and Dedication to Mission Success  Is Aware of Personal Limitations  Adapts to Change and Uncertainty  Uses Intuition/ Sensing  Is Able to Deal  with Politics, Financial Issues, and Customer Needs Communication  Listens Effectively and Translates Information  Communicates Effectively Through Personal Interaction  Facilitates an Environment of Open and Honest Communication  Uses Visuals to Communicate Complex Interactions  Communicates Through Story Telling and Analogies  Is Comfortable with Making Decisions Problem Identifies the Real Problem Solving Systems Thinking   Assimilates, Analyzes, and Synthesizes Data  Thinks Systemically  Has the Ability to Find Connections and Patterns Across the System  Sets Priorities  Keeps the Focus on Mission Requirements  Possesses Creativity and Problem Solving Abilities  Validates Facts, Information and Assumptions  Remains Open Minded and Objective  Draws on Past Experiences  Manages Risk Technical Acumen  Possesses Technical Competence and Has Comprehensive Previous Experience  Learns from Successes and Failures  5  S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS   Good systems engineers typically view the system or subsystem as a non-linear web of \223connects\224 or 223disconnects\224 to be solved.  They have a high degree of curiosity mixed with self-confidence and persistence and are achievement-oriented.  They are drawn to the challenge of solving complex problems by possessing an approach that is comprehensive and intentionally does not favor any particular sub-element of a system.  They look across the entire system and facilitate trades and compromises to get a balance, optimized design.  They exhibit excellent human relations skills and understand how to create a vision for the team by keeping the team on track by holding a big picture view of what needs to be accomplished in order to reach mission requirements  They are not afraid to admit what they don\222t know, and are willing to seek experts who do have the knowledge.  They clearly demonstrate the growth mindset in all its many facets.  These findings are consistent with the literature on highly successful and effective people   2  11 12 13   According to John Maxwell in his leadership books The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership  and The 360 Degree Leader  u st posse ss certain leadership qualities in order to be successful.  They must be able to influence others above, below and across the organization build trust, and help others be successful.  They must be willing to admit what they don\222t know and be willing to learn.  They must be willing to both lead and follow Lastly, when they speak, others want to listen and are eager to follow.  It is noteworthy and fortunate that these are the very qualities exhibited by NASA SEs.  Interestingly, most 


  6 NASA SEs do not see themselves as leaders per se, but rather as competent engineers  Most NASA systems engineers stated that good systems engineering does not come from a degree in systems engineering, but from hands-on learning and doing working closely with other successful SEs. They felt strongly that in ten years, the art of systems engineering and the needed SE behaviors would be the same, but that some processes and tools might be different and that certainly the systems themselves would be larger and more complex  While SEs need training in all three axes of the SE competency model \226 process knowledge, technical knowledge, and personal behavior s \226 the personal behaviors component is where the maximum leverage is gained.  That is what separates the merely good SEs from the highly regarded and successful SE s.  The typical NASA SE training program largely ignores the behavior component to the detriment of SEs.  Hence, the results of this study show the need for a major paradigm shift in training SEs NASA recently initiated the Systems Engineering Leadership Development Program \(SELDP\12-month program that provides for technical development in systems engineering in the form of assignments outside the home Center, technical and leadersh ip training, and leadership development, including coaching and mentoring. The SELDP includes many of the hands-on elements needed to truly inculcate the SE behaviors, e.g., developmental assignments, leadership development, mentoring, coaching and job shadowi  While the NASA SELDP is a start in developing the next generation of SEs, it is by no means the end, but rather only a beginning.  The agency would gain value by taking this information and seriously considering inculcating these behaviors into all training for the SE Community  The results of the initial JPL SE Behavioral Study and the Agency-wide study are similar The results of the Agencywide study indicate that while there are many separate Center cultures at NASA, ther e are also shared Systems Engineering behaviors that provide NASA great opportunities on which to build.  Identifying and making these similarities explicit through the use of studies such as this creates a common language and a way to build on the strengths of one of the largest brain trusts in the world.  The similarities in the findings across NASA were unmistakable in proving this point.  Further work in this area could include benchmarking non-governmental agencies to see if SEs in industry exhibit the same behaviors as those at the NASA Centers In conclusion, there are clearly identifiable behaviors that highly successful systems engineers exhibit.  It is not only possible, but highly desirable to openly communicate what those behaviors are, and to encourage members of the systems engineering community to develop them through training, coaching and mentoring.  Knowing how successful systems engineers behave and sharing that information with the SE community establishes a standard for hiring evaluation and personnel development 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   Many people have contributed to the success of NASA\222s Systems Engineering Behavior Study 200  Wiley Larson \226 Director, Sp ace Systems Engineering Stevens Institute of Technology 200  SE Interviewees \226   M.
