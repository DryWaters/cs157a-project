It is one of essential theme in document mining. Based on vector space model \(VSM presents a new document cluster algorithm based on assoelation rule, and dimL98es the ettidency, the sealability and h e  complexity of the algorithm Keywordtx Rule; Document Feature Vector Document Mining; Document Clustering; Assodation 1. Intrnduction Clustering is the process of grouping the data into classes or clusters so that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another, but are very dissimilar to objects in other clusters. The dissimilarities are assessed based on the amibute values describing the objects. Distance measures are often used. Unlike in classification, the class label of each object is not known The clustering analysis came from many research fields such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition and so on. Owing to the huge amounts of data collected in databases, and for it can find the hidden relations and pattems in data without any prior knowledge of application fields, cluster analysis has recently become a highly active topic in data mining. Generally the clustering techniques include partitioning methods, hierarchical methods density-based methods, and model-based methods   Text databases are rapidly growing due to the increasing amount of information available in electronic forms, such as electronic publications, e-mail, and the World Wide Web. Traditional information retrieval techniques become inadequate for the increasingly vast amount of text data. Typically, only a small fraction of the many available documents will be relevant to a user Without knowing what could be in the documents, it is difficult to formulate effective queries for analysiing and exbacting useful information from the data. We need useful tools to compare different documents, rank the importance and relevance of the documents, and find patterns and trends among documents. Thus, text mining has become an increasingly popular and essential theme of data mining Most researches of data mining have focused on structured data, such as relational, transactional, and data warehouses. But data store in most text databases are semistructured or even unstructured, thus, the modeling and implementation of semistructured or unstructured data have becqme an essential part of document miningt2   There mainly existed two ways in document clustering One is based on the probabilitymd the other on the distance. The methods based on the Bayesian probability theory  describe the clustering result by probability distributing method and have the ability to deal with the overlaps between clusters. Meanwhile, there existid a weakness that the result couldn  t be satisfied with the clustering precision and efficiency when the higher dimensions of the feature space or higher associations between feature values. The methods based on the di~tance    include k-mean method, BIRCH method typically and so on. Both of them model document by feaNre vector, and then regard document as a point of the vector space and finally cluster by the distance between the 


vector space and finally cluster by the distance between the pair of these points. Basically, these methods could be very easy to be understand, but the weakness is the clustering quality and algorithm efficiency decreased obviously when the higher document dimensions. Paper [5] proposed a document clustering based on feature vector space of document subject In this paper, firstly, we model document based on vector space model \(VSM of document by document feature vectors, then find initial clusters of documents by using classical fast algorithm of finding frequent item sets, lastly, improve the quality of the initial clusters according to the distance between the clusters and the Link intensity of the documents to cluster We present relevant algorithms and discuss the efficiency 0-7803-8403-2104/$20.00 @ZOO4 IEEE 1310 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Shanghai  26-29 August 2004 scalability and the time complexity of the algorithm 2. Modeling of h m e n t In the Vector Space Model \(VSM be deemed to consist of a p u p  of key words/phrases k~ ,kz ,  .... k]. We put a weighted value w, according to importance of every key wodphrase in document, so the w, could be viewed as k,'s coordinate value, that is to say that a document could be viewed as a point i nn  dimensions space. From this, we transferred the document clustering into the one in the n dimension vector space. We use the value of document feature vector to represent coordinate value of document in vector space. In the following, we will defme specifically and describe the concepts that will be used in the modeling process. For points of the simplification. we consider that the numbers of key worddphrases are the same, denote n 2.1. h m e n t  Feature Vector Definition l\(associatioli intensity documents, the association intensity between document Dj and keyword ki is defined as' I, I where IIU Djll is the total number of efficient words in Dj Ih$ll is the number of occurrence of the keyword k, in document D Remark  a, could be standardized by standardization method, still denoted a,, c:=, a, = 1, 1 S i &lt; m , m is the,number of documents Definition %document feature vector of documents, Di E D ,  the 'document feature vector is defined as   2  In this paper, we use a.. to represent the coordinate l i value of document Now, we 'could construct the document transaction matrix Mnxm that the column vectors y the document feature vectors a; defined in.definitiou 2 a,, a,, ... a,j ... a a,, a, ... aZj ... azm ai, a, ... a, ... a a,, an, ... a, ... a   3 From this, we can view document as transaction and document feature vectors as transaction items, so as to be adapted to association rules 23.

Initial Clustering of Dowment In document transaction matrix, we viewed document as transaction, document feature vectors as transaction item If some document feature vectors often occur together in some documents, we could say that relevant documents are similar.

After the membership functions are derived the fwzymining method proposed in 5 is then used to mine fuzzy association rules from the quantitative database 7 Conclusion and future works In this paper we have proposed a GA-based fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions Since the fitness of each set of membership functions is evaluated by the fuzzy supports of the linguistic terms in the large I-itemsets and the suitability of the derived membership functions the derivation process can easily be done by the divide-and-conquer strategy Our approach can reduce human experts\222 intervention during the mining process thus saving much acquisition time In the future we will continuously attempt to enhance the GA-based mining framework for more complex problems Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their very constructive comments This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under contract NSC92-22 13-E-390-001 References l R Agrawal and R Srikant, \223Fast algorithm for mining association rules,\224 The International Conference on Very Large Databases 1994 pp 487-499 0 Cordbn F Herrera and P Villar, \223Generating the knowledge base of a fuzzy rule-based system by the 2 31 genetic learning of the data base,\224 IEEE Transactions on Fuzv Systems Vol 9 No 4,2001 F Herrera M Lozano and J L Verdegay 223Fuzzy connectives based crossover operators to model genetic algorithms population diversity,\224 Fuzzy Sets andSysfems Vol. 92 No 1 pp 21-30 1997 T P Hong C S Kuo and S C Chi 223Mining association rules from quantitative data\224 Intelligent Data Analysis Vol 3 No 5 1999 pp 363-376 T P Hong C S Kuo and S C Chi 223Trade-off between time complexity and number of rules for fuzzy mining from quantitative data,\224 International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge based Systems Vol 9 No 5,2001 pp 587-604 M Kaya, and R Alhajj 223A clustering algorithm with genetically optimized membership functions for fuzzy association rules mining,\224 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2003 pp 881 886 R Srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables,\224 The 1996 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Monreal, Canada, June 1996 pp 1-12 C H Wang T P Hong and S S Tseng, \223Integrating fuzzy knowledge by genetic algorithms,\224 ZEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Vol 2 C H Wang, T P Hong and S S Tseng, \223Integrating membership functions and fuzzy rule sets from multiple knowledge sources,\222\222 Fuzzy Sets and Sysfems W Wang and S M Bridges 223Genetic algorithm optimization of membership functions for mining fuzzy association rules,\224 The International Joint Conference on Information Systems Fuzzy Theory and Technology, 2000 pp 13 1-1 34 NO.4 pp 138-149 1998 Vol 112 pp 141-154,2000 121 


some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
