IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY VOL 12 NO 8 AUGUST 2017 1931 Strong Key-Exposure Resilient Auditing for Secure Cloud Storage Jia Yu and Huaqun Wang Abstract  Key exposure is one serious security problem for cloud storage auditing In order to deal with this problem cloud storage auditing scheme with key-exposure resilience has been proposed However in such a scheme the malicious cloud might still forge valid authenticators later than the key-exposure time period if it obtains the current secret key of data owner In this paper we innovatively propose a paradigm named strong key-exposure resilient auditing for secure cloud storage in which the security of cloud storage auditing not only earlier 
than but also later than the key exposure can be preserved We formalize the denition and the security model of this new kind of cloud storage auditing and design a concrete scheme In our proposed scheme the key exposure in one time period doesnít affect the security of cloud storage auditing in other time periods The rigorous security proof and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves desirable security and efciency Index Terms  Cloud computing cloud storage auditing data integrity key exposure I I NTRODUCTION N OWADAYS cloud storage is becoming one of the most attractive choices for individuals and enterprises to store their large scale of data It can avoid committing large capital 
of users for purchasing and managing hardware and software Although the beneﬁts of cloud storage are tremendous security concerns become signiﬁcant challenges for cloud storage One major concern on cloud storage security is about the integrity of the data stored in cloud Becau se clients lose the control of their data stored in cloud and data loss might happen in cloud storage it is natural for clients to doubt whether their data are correctly stored in cloud or not Cloud storage auditing as one effective security technique is proposed to ensure the integrity of the data stored in cloud Many cloud storage auditing schemes have been proposed up to now   T hes e s c hemes c ons i d er s e v e ral d i f ferent aspects of cloud storage auditing such as the data dynamic Manuscript received September 14 2016 revised January 17 2017 and March 18 2017 accepted April 12 2017 Date of publication April 18 2017

storage auditing scheme in 13  t o s o m e e x t en t can d eal with the key exposure problem However in some cases the key exposure problem is not fully solved in the scheme 13 d u e to th e f o llo win g r easo n  When the key exposure happens it often cannot be found out at once The key exposure might be difﬁcult to be found out because the attacker might stop intrusion at once when it gets the client’s secret key So it is common that there is a long time span crossing multiple time periods between key exposure and its detection The key exposure might be detected only when the user nds the valid authenticators are not generated by himself At that time the user has to revoke the old pair of public key and secret key and regenerate a new pair We give an example to show this problem in Fig 1 
Suppose the hacker has appropriated the client’s secret key during session t e but the key exposure has not been detected at that time The attacker can update the exposed secret key as same as the client does to generate the secret keys for time periods t e  t d until key exposure is found out during time period t d  This means that the malicious cloud trading with this hacker can modify even delete the client’s data uploaded during time periods t e  t d without worrying about being found out It can generate the authenticators for fake data to pass the cloud storage auditing using the updated secret keys It is a natural problem of how to protect the security of the 
cloud storage auditing during the time periods not only earlier than but also later than the key exposure A Contribution The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 We investigate how to preserve the security of cloud storage auditing scheme in any time period other than the key-exposure time period when the key exposure happens 1556-6013  2017 I EEE Personal u se is perm itted but republication/redistri bution requires IEEE permission See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information 


1932 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY VOL 12 NO 8 AUGUST 2017 Fig 1 The security problem between key exposure and its intrusion We propose a paradigm named strong key-exposure resilient auditing as a practical solution for this problem in this paper 2 We design a concrete strong key-exposure resilient auditing scheme for secure cloud storage A novel and efﬁcient key update technique is used in the designed scheme In our detailed construction the Third Party Auditor TPA generates an update message from his secret key in each time period and then sends it to the client The client updates his signing secret key based on his private key and the update message from the TPA This method makes the malicious cloud unable to obtain the signing secret keys in unexposed time periods Different from  t he l i f et i m e o f t he  l e s t o red i n c l oud does not need to be xed initially So it can support key updates for unlimited time periods 3 We formalize the deﬁnition and the security model of this new paradigm In the security model we consider the most powerful adversary who can query the secret keys of the client in all except one unexposed time period We also prove the security of our scheme in the formalized security model and justify its performance by concrete implementation B Related Work In recent years a lot of studies on cloud security such as

auditing have been considered in and  32 r es pect i v el y  In 13 t he cl i e nt  s secret keys are updated in different time periods The key exposure cannot affect the security of authenticators generated before the key-exposure time period However as we have analyzed it cannot fully solve the key exposure problem in some cases i.e the security of au thenticators generated later than the key-exposure time period is still unable to preserve Therefore the contributions of this paper can be viewed as the further research on the key exposure problem in cloud storage auditing C Organization The rest paper is organized as follows In Section II we introduce system model deﬁnition security model and preliminaries Then we give a detailed description of the proposed scheme in Section III The security analysis and the efﬁciency evaluation are given in Section IV At last we conclude the paper in Section V II F ORMULATION AND PRELIMINARIES A System Model The system comprises three parties the cloud the client and the third party auditor TPA The cloud offers storage services to the client The client uploads his les along with the corresponding authenticators to the cloud and then deletes these data from his storage sp ace The client can retrieve them from the cloud when he needs them.The TPA is a powerful party and is in charge of two important tasks The rst is to 


YU AND WANG STRONG KEY-EXPOSURE RESILIENT AUDITING FOR SECURE CLOUD STORAGE 1933 Fig 2 The proposed system model provide auditing service i.e periodically check the integrity of the les stored in cloud for the client The second is to help the client update his secret keys by providing update messages to the client in different time periods As same as most of public integrity auditin g schemes the TPA is honest for integrity auditing on behalf of cloud users However it is not fully trustworthy for key update in our system model The system model is shown in Fig 2 Assume that one le F stored in cloud is divided into n blocks m i  i  1  n   Different from the system model in  t he l i f et i m e o f  l e F in our system model does not need to be xed initially It means the total number of time periods in unbounded which is more close to the reality B Deﬁnition and Security Model Deﬁnition 1 A strong key-exposure resilient auditing scheme for secure cloud storage consists of six algorithms such that 1 System setup algorithm SysSetup  This algorithm is run by the client It takes as input a security parameter k  and generates a system public key PK  the TPA’s secret key SK TPA and the client’s private key SK c  2 Update message generation algorithm UMGen This algorithm is run by the TPA at the beginning of each time period It takes as input the public key PK thecurrent time period t and the TPA’s secret key SK TPA and generates an update message  t  3 Client key update algorithm CKeyUpdate  This algorithm is run by the client at the beginning of each time period It takes as input the public key PK  the current time period t  the update message  t and the client’s private key SK c  and generates the signing secret key SK t for time period t  4 Authenticator generation algorithm AuthGen This algorithm is run by the client It takes as input the public key PK  the current time period t  the client’s signing secret key SK t and a le F  and generates a set of authenticators  for F in time period t  5 Proof generation algorithm ProofGen  This algorithm is run by the cloud It takes as input the public key PK  a time period t  a challenge Chal aﬁle F and a set of authenticators   and generates a proof P that is used to prove the cloud stores F correctly In this algorithm the  t  Chal  pair is issued by the TPA and then used by the cloud as input 6 Proof verifying algorithm ProofVerify  This algorithm is run by the TPA It takes as input the public key PK  a time period t  a challenge Chal and a proof P  and returns true if the veriﬁcation passed or false otherwise Note that the client’s secret information includes two parts One is the signing secret key SK t  which is used to generate authenticators i n time period t  The other is the private key SK c  which is used to generate the signing key SK t in time period t  In order to formalize the security we deﬁne a game between an adversary A and a challenger C to show how the adversary attacks the security of a strong key-exposure resilient auditing scheme In this game we consider the most powerful adversary who can query the secret keys of the client in all except one unexposed time period This game comprises the following four phases 1 Setup phase  Initially set time period t 0 C runs SysSetup algorithm to generate the public key PK  the TPA’s secret key SK TPA and the client’s secret key SK c  C sends PK to A and holds SK c himself at this phase 2 Query phase  C runs key update algorithm to generate the client’s signing key SK t in time period t  I Authenticator queries A adaptively selects a series of blocks m 1  m n  and submits them to C to query the corresponding authenticators in time period t  The challenger computes and returns the corresponding authenticators for m i  i  1  n  in this time period II Secret key queries A can select to query the secret key of the client in time period t  If he does C sends the client’s ptivate key SK c and signing key SK t in time period t to A  At the end of each time period A can select to stay in this phase or go to the Challenge phase 3 Challenge phase  C selects a time period t  in which A does not make the secret key queries C sends A a challenge Chal   i v i  i  I where I  s 1  s 2  s c   1  s l  n 1  l  c 1  c  n  It also requests A to provide a proof of possession P for le F   m 1  m n  under Chal for the blocks m s 1  m s c in time period t   4 Forgery phase  A outputs a proof of possession P for the blocks indicated by Chal in the time period t  and returns P  If ProofVerify  PK  t  Chal  P  then A wins in above game The above security model captures that an adversary cannot provide a valid proof for a time period in which the secret key is not exposed without owning all the blocks corresponding to a given challenge if it cannot guess all the missing blocks In each time period the adversary can query the authenticators of all the blocks The adversary can also query the secret keys in all except the challenged time period The goal of the adversary is to construct a valid proof of possession P for the blocks indicated by Chal in the time period t   The following 


1934 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY VOL 12 NO 8 AUGUST 2017 deﬁnition shows that there exists a knowledge extractor that can extract the challenged le blocks whenever the adversary can produce valid proof of possession P in the time period t   Deﬁnition 2 We say a cloud storage auditing scheme is strong key-exposure resilient if the following condition satisﬁes whenever an adversary in above described game can cause the challenger to accept its proof with non-negligible probability there is a knowledge extractor that can extract all the challenged le blocks except possibly with negligible probability The following deﬁnition describes the detectability for the auditing scheme which shows the cloud shoul d maintain the blocks that are not challenged with high probability Deﬁnition 3 We say a cloud storage auditing scheme is   detectable if given a fraction  of corrupted blocks the probability that the corrupted blocks are detected is at least   In above system model the TPA generates an update message to help the client update his secret key in each time period Another security requirement is that the TPA is not able to forge any authenticator through his secret key and the generated update messages We give the following security deﬁnition to capture this requirement Deﬁnition 4 We say the authenticator generation is secure if the TPA cannot forge the authenticator for any block through his secret key and the update messages he generates The TPA might incorrectly execute the update key generation algorithm That is the TPA might provides the client wrong update key due to some reason In this case the client should be able to verify the correctness of the update key provided by the TPA Deﬁnition 5 We say a strong key-exposure resilient auditing for secure cloud storage is v eriﬁable if the TPA provides the wrong update key in UMGen algorithm he cannot pass the veriﬁcation of our proposed scheme C Preliminaries 1 Bilinear Map There are two multiplicative cyclic groups G 1 and G 2  which have the same prime order q  We say a map  e  G 1  G 1  G 2 is a bilinear map if it satisﬁes 1 Bilinearity For  g 1  g 2  G 1 and  a  b  Z  q   e  g a 1  g b 2   e  g 1  g 2  ab  2 Non-degeneracy  e  g 1  g 2    1 where g 1  g 2 are the generators of G 1  3 Computability There is an efﬁcient algorithm to compute  e  g 1  g 2  for g 1  g 2  G 1  2 CDH Problem Given  g  g a  g b  where g is a generator of multiplicative group G 1 with order q and a  b  Z  q  compute g ab  III O UR P ROPOSED S CHEME A Technique Explanation One big challenge of designing such a scheme is that the signing secret keys change in different time periods while the public key is unchanged in all of time periods We use a new key update technique that is different from that of I n o rder to achie v e the s trong k e y-e xpos ure r es ilience we make the signing secret key in each time period be a multiplication of two parts Each part is the power of H 1  t   where H 1 is a hash function and t is the current time period One part is the update message generated by the TPA which is computed through the secret key of the TPA and the current time period The other part is computed from the secret key of the client and the current time period The signing secret key in any time period must be jointly generated by the client and the TPA This technique can support both the provable security and the efﬁcient key update As a result if the attacker intrudes the client in one time period he cannot obtain the client’s signing secret keys in other time periods without the secret key of the TPA The designed authenticator can support the structure of signing secret keys and the property of blockless veriﬁability Because the time period as an important factor is integrated into the computation of authenticators the authenticators of the same l e blocks generated in different time periods are different The ProofVerify algorithm can verify whether the proof corresponding to the declared time period is indeed valid or not B Description of Our Scheme Let  e  G 1  G 1  G 2 be a bilinear map where G 1 and G 2 are two multiplicative groups with order q Let g and u be two generators of group G 1 and H 1  0  1    G 1  H 2  0  1    G 1  G 1 be two cryptographic hash functions Generally there is a digital signature SSig that is used to ensure the integrity of the le identiﬁer name in previous cloud storage auditing schemes 5   7    1 3   I n t h i s p ap er  w e a lso u se th e same digital signature SSig to ensure the integrity of the le identiﬁer name and the time period t  We assume  spk  ssk  is a pair of public key and secret key corresponding to signature SSig  the client has held the secret key ssk  and the public key spk has been published Such an assumption can simplify our scheme description thereafter Similar to previous cloud storage auditing schemes 2   4    7 8 13 t he cl i e nt  r s t l y di vi des one  l e F stored on the cloud into a set of n ordered blocks m 1  m 2  m n where m i  Z  q in our scheme In time period t  the signing secret key of the client is SK t  G 1  The authenticator for each block m i in time period t is generated as follows The client selects a random r  Z  q and computes R  g r  He computes the authenticator for each block m i in time period t as  i  H 2  t  i  name  R  r  u rm i  SK t where name is the name of the le F  1 SysSetup algorithm a The client randomly selects SK c  Z  q as his private key The client’s public key is PK c  g SK c  b The client randomly selects SK TPA

If the adversary succeeds but R in its proof P is different from the real R in the list of authenticators C can solve the CDH problem in G 1 with no-negligible probability Game 3 Game 3 is the same as Game 2 with only one difference The challenger C keeps a list of his responses to authenticator queries from the adversary The challenger C observes each instance in this list If in any instance the adversary succeeds but the adversa ry’s aggregate authenticator  is not equal to    i  I  i v i  then the challenger will abort Analysis Suppose the le that makes the challenger abort in time period t is composed by m 1  m n  The name of this le is name and that the set of authenticators for this le is   t  R  1  n   Let the query making the challenger abort be  i v i  i  I and the proof of the adversary be P   t  R  012  012   Let the expected response from the honest prover be P   t  R   Therefore the validity of the proof can be veriﬁed by the following equation  e  g   e  R   i  I H 2  t  i  name  R  v i  u    e  PK c  PK TPA  H 1  t   i  I v i  Because the challenger aborts we can know that  012    and  012 can pass the following veriﬁcation equation i.e that  e  g  012   e  R   i  I H 2  t  i  name  R  v i  u  012   e  PK c  PK TPA  H 1  t   i  I v i   Denote    012    Obviously    0 otherwise it means  012    which contradicts the assumption Now we construct a simulator to solve the CDH problem 


YU AND WANG STRONG KEY-EXPOSURE RESILIENT AUDITING FOR SECURE CLOUD STORAGE 1937 Input a tuple  g  g a 012 v to the simulator the simulator nally outputs v a 012  The simulator plays the role of the challenger in Game 2 with the following differences In Setup phase the simulator sets u  g  v 012 for some  012  R Z  q  The simulator generates the secret keys of all the time periods like the real circumstance H 2 is viewed as a random oracle controlled and stored by the simulator When the adversary queries H 2 oracle at a point  t  i  name  R   the simulator checks whether  t  i  name  R  has appeared in one tuple  t  i  name  R  h   of H 2 table If it has the challenger returns h to the adversary Otherwise the simulator selects   R Z  q  computes h  g   and adds tuple  t  i  name  R  h    to H 2 table Finally the simulator returns h to the adversary as the reply When the adversary queries the authenticator of one block m i with name name in time period t  the simulator selects 015 r i  R Z  q  computes R   g a 012  015 andsets h  g r i  g  v 012  m i  The probability that H 2  t  i  name  R  has been deﬁned is negligible The simulator can compute authenticator  i  H 2  t  i  name  R  a 012 015  u a 012 015 m i  SK t   g r i  g  v 012  m i  a 012 015   g  v 012  a 012 015 m i  SK t  g r i a 012 015  SK t Note that the simulator knows SK t because he generates the secret keys of all the time periods at the beginning The simulator adds  t  i  name  R  h  r i 015  to H 2 table If the adversary succeeds in the game by replying a proof P   t  R  012  012  in which  012 is different from the expected   we can extract a tuple  t  i  name  R  h  r i 015  from H 2 table By dividing the veriﬁcation equation for the forged  012 by the veriﬁcation equation for the expected   we can get  e  g  012    e  R  u    e  R  g  v 012     So  e  g  012    1  R     e  g a 012  015 v 012   We can solve the CDH problem v a 012   012    1  R    015 012  1  Therefore if there is a non-negligible difference between the probabilities that the adversary succeeds in Game 2 and Game 3 the constructed simulator can solve the CDH problem From now on we know  must be true in any successful proof Game 4 Game 4 is the same as Game 3 with only one difference The challenger keeps and observes each instance of its responses to authenticator queries with the adversary If in any instance the adversary is successful but there exists one adversary’s aggregate message  is not equal to    i  I m i v i  then the challenger will abort Analysis Suppose Chal  i v i  i  I is the query that makes the challenger abort and P 012   t  R 012  012  012  is the proof from the adversary Let the expected response from the honest prover be P   t  R   From Game 2 and Game 3 we know R  R 012 and    012  So it can be at most the value  012 is different from  in P and P 012 Deﬁne    012    again    0 If the adversary can cause the challenger in Game 4 abort then we can construct a simulator to solve the discrete logarithm problem The simulator is given two values g v  G 1 hisgoalis to compute x satisfying v  g x  The simulator acts like the challenger in Game 3 with th e following differences In Setup phase the simulator sets u  g  v 012 for some  012  R Z  q  The simulator interacts with the adversary until the adversary successes in responding with the aggregate value  012 that is different from the expected aggregate value  Bythe veriﬁcation equations using  012 and   we can get the following equations  e  R   i  I H 2  t  i  name  R  v i  u    e  PK c  PK TPA  H 1  t   i  I v i   e  g   e  g  012   e  R   i  I H 2  t  i  name  R  v i  u  012   e  PK c  PK TPA  H 1  t   i  I v i  So we know u   u  012  u   1  g  v 012  1  v  g  012 Therefore if there exists a non-negligible difference between the adversary’s probabilities of success in Game 3 and Game 4 we can construct a simulator to solve the discrete logarithm problem As we have analyzed there is only negligible difference probability between these games Note that the hardness of the CDH problem implies the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem If the CDH problem in G 1 is hard and the signature scheme SSig used for le tags is existentially unforgeable the challenger will reject except when the prover responds with correctly computed values in proof P  Now we will construct a knowledge extractor to extract the whole challenged le blocks m s 1  m s 2  m s c  By selecting independent coefﬁcients v 1 v 2 v c to execute the challenge phase on the same blocks m s 1  m s 2  m s c for c times the extractor can collect c independent linear equations in the variables m s 1  m s 2  m s c  The extractor can extract m s 1  m s 2  m s c by solving these equations This completes the proof of Theorem 2 Theorem 3 Detectability Our proposed auditing scheme is  m n  1   n  m n  c  detectable if the cloud stores a le with n blocks including m bad deleted or modiﬁed blocks and c blocks are challenged Proof Assume that the cloud stores a le with total n blocks including m bad deleted or modiﬁed blocks The number of challenged blocks is c  Thus the bad blocks can be found out if and only if at least one of the challenged blocks chosen by the TPA matches the bad blocks We use a discrete random variable X to denote the number of blocks selected by the challenger that matches the block-tag pairs changed by the adversary We use P X to denote the probability that at least one block chosen by the challenger matches the blocks changed by the adversary So P X  P  X  1   1  P  X  0   1  n  m n n  1  m n  1  n  c  1  m n  c  1 


1938 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY VOL 12 NO 8 AUGUST 2017 We can get P X  1   n  m n  c  Thus the propos ed auditing scheme is  m n  1   n  m n  c  detectable if the cloud stores a le with n blocks including m bad deleted or modiﬁed blocks and c blocks are challenged Theorem 4 The TPA cannot forge the authenticator for any block through his secret key and the update messages he generates Proof From AuthGen algorithm we know the computation of any authenticator in time period t requires the secret key SK t  According to the key update of the client the secret key SK t is determined by two secret keys SK TPA and SK c  that is SK t  H 1  t  SK c   t  H 1  t  SK c  H 1  t  SK TPA From the view of the TPA in our scheme the TPA only knows SK TPA and can only compute the update message  t  It means the TPA can not compute SK t because it does not know the secret key SK c of the client Therefore the TPA cannot forge the authenticator for any block through his secret key and the update messages he generates Theorem 5 The proposed strong ke y-exposure resilient auditing for secure cloud storage is veriﬁable Proof From UMGen algorithm we know any incorrect update key cannot pass the equation  e  g  t    e  PK TPA  H 1  t   Therefore this Theorem follows B Performance Analysis We rstly give numerical analysis of computation and communication overhead of the proposed scheme in main phases and then evaluate the proposed scheme through several practical experiments 1 Computation and Communication Overhead In the phase of key update the client needs to compute the signing secret key SK t  which costs Exp G 1  Mul G 1 where Exp G 1 denotes the computation of one exponentiation in G 1 and Mul G 1 denotes the computation of one multiplication in G 1  In the phase of challenge generation the TPA only chooses some random values to construct a challenge message which costs little computation In the phase of proof generation the cloud needs to generate the proof P   t  R  Itcosts c  Exp G 1   c  1   Mul G 1  c  Mul Z q   c  1   Sum Z q where Mul Z q denotes the computation of one multiplication and Sum Z q denotes the computation of one addition in Z q Inthe phase of proof verifying the cloud needs to verify whether the proof P is valid or not by the veriﬁcation equation It costs  c  2   Exp G 1   c  1   Mul G 1   c  1   Sum Z q  3 Pair  Mul G 2 where Pair denotes the computation of one pairing and Mul G 2 denotes the computation of one multiplication in G 2  The communication overhead in our proposed scheme includes the challenge overhead and the proof overhead The challenge message is composed by c pairs of elements  i v i   So the challenge overhead is c    n  q   where  n  is the length of an index and  q  is the length of an element in Z q  The overhead of proof message  t  R  is about 2  G 1  q  where  G 1  is the length of an element in G 1 The size of t is negligible compared with G 1 and q  2 Experimental Results With the help of the Pairing-Based Cryptography PBC library w e e v a l u at e t he propos ed Fig 3 The key update time in our proposed scheme and the scheme  scheme in several experiments We run these experiments on a Linux server with Intel processor running at 2.70 GHz and 4 GB memory We choose a bilinear map that uses a supersingular elliptic curve to achieve the fast pairing operations The base eld of this curve is 160 bits the size of an element in Z  q is 20 bytes and the size of an element in group G 1 is 128 bytes In our experiments the data le is set to 20M which consists of 1,000,000 blocks In order to compare the efﬁciency of our proposed scheme with that of the scheme  which uses a full binary tree with depth 2 we consider the current time period varying from 0 to 14 In our proposed scheme the time for the client to update a secret key is independent of the time period because it needs one exponentiation and one multiplication in G 1 in any time period In contrast the key update time of the client is relevant to the time period in scheme  W e c ompare t h e k e y updat e time between the both schemes in Fig.3 In the scheme  the key update time is related to the depth of the node corresponding to the current time period in the full binary tree When the node is the internal node the key update time is about 12.6ms when the node is the leaf node the key update time is nearly 0ms In our proposed scheme the key update time is about 5.8ms in all time periods It means the client can update the signing secret key using the same computational resource in each time period The average update cost of our proposed scheme is the same as that in the scheme Therefore our proposed scheme achieves stronger security without decreasing the efﬁciency of key updates for the client In addition our proposed scheme supports key updates for unlimited time periods However the lifetime of the le stored in cloud must be known and xed initially in the scheme 13  Thus the scheme can onl y s upport k e y updat e s f or a xed T time periods When T time periods are over the cloud storage auditing cannot work any longer With the different number of challenged blocks we demonstrate the time of different auditing processes including the challenge generation process the proof generation process and the proof veriﬁcation process through the experiments in Fig.4 In our experiment the number of challenged blocks varies from 100 to 1,000 From Fig.4 we can know the challenge generation process spends the least time which is 0.26s at most the proof generation process spends a little more time varying from 0.18s to 1.79s the proof veriﬁcation process spends the most time varying from 0.22s to 2.05s 


YU AND WANG STRONG KEY-EXPOSURE RESILIENT AUDITING FOR SECURE CLOUD STORAGE 1939 Fig 4 The time of auditing processes with different number of challenged blocks Fig 5 The challenge overhead with different number of challenged blocks Fig 6 The proof overhead with different number of challenged blocks In our proposed scheme the communication overhead consists of the challenge overhead and the proof overhead As same as most of cloud storage auditing schemes the challenge overheads of the proposed scheme and the scheme are both Chal   i v i  i  I where i is used to determine which blocks will be checked and v i is used to mix the challenged blocks Therefore the proposed scheme and the scheme have the same challenge overhead Because the challenge overhead is c    n  q    it has a linear relationship with the number c of challenged blocks In Fig.5 when the number of checked blocks varies from 100 to 1,000 the size of the challenge message varies from 2.29KB to 22.89KB Because the size of the proof message is 2  G 1  q   it is independent of the time period From Fig.6 we can see that the size of the proof message keeps about 148B in all the time periods which is much smaller than that in the scheme V C ONCLUSION In this paper we further study on how to deal with the key exposure problem in cloud storage auditing We propose a new paradigm called strong key-exposure resilient auditing scheme for secure cloud storage In this paradigm the security of the cloud storage auditing not only earlier than but also later than the key exposure can be preserved We formalize the deﬁnition and the security model of this new kind of cloud storage auditing and design a concrete scheme The security proof and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is

1920 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING VOL 65 NO 7 APRIL 1 2017 guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the optimal solution to the xed-channel rate-constrained problem in 29 must be of rank one for any H 010V Let  V i   H i  h i h H i  003 i  003 i 002 0  h i 010 C N  005 h i   h i 005 2 2 Tr 003 i  012 013 max  C i    It is easy to see that V i 023  V i  Furthermore from the part-two proof it is immediate that 41 implies that the optimal solution to Problem 29 must be of rank one for any H 010  V 1   V K  Consequently 41 also implies the same rank-one result for any H 010V  and the proof is complete 003 B A Modi\036ed Spherically Bounded Model for FDD Consider a specialized model for limited channel feedback in the FDD system I n t his conte x t each user i is preassigned a channel direction codebook C i   v i 1  v i,L   where every codebook element v i,l satisﬁes 005 v i,l 005 2 1 and L is the codebook size The user estimates the channel h i and feeds back two quantities to the base station namely the channel norm 005 h i 005 2 and the codebook-quantized channel direction  v i  arg max v 010C i  h H i v   005 h i 005 2  Consequently the presumed channel is  h i  005 h i 005 2   v i  If we assume that the channel direction quantization is the dominant source of error then we may model the channel error e i  h i   h i as 005  h i  e i 005 2  005  h i 005 2  005 e i 005 2 005  h i 005 2 012 016 where 016 0 describes a bound on the channel direction quantization error The corresponding channel set U i is U i   h i 010 C N 005 h i   h i 005 2 012 016 005  h i 005 2  005 h i 005 2  005  h i 005 2   42 For the above model an extended form of the S lemma can be established to deal with the corresponding robust rateconstrained problem W ith the e xtended S lemma we have the same development as in Section II-B Again our interest here lies in the rank-one condition Corollary 3 Consider Problem 2 under the channel sets in 42 The rank-one result in Theorem 1 holds if 8 is replaced by 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2 016 2  1 K  021 K  1 K 022 005 k k 1 K 43 where  h i   h i  005  h i 005 2  and  002 i is the orthogonal complement projector of   h 1   h i  1   h i 1   h K   We should note that  h i in the above corollary is the channel direction and following the aforementioned system model  h i lies in the codebook viz  h i   v i 010C i  Corollary 3 suggests that if the chosen codebook elements  v i among different users are not too similar and if the codebook resolution is high so that 016 is small then the rank-one condition can be achieved Also unlike the result for the spherically bounded model the rankone condition in 43 does not depend on the channel magnitude 005  h i 005 2 2  The proof of Corollary 3 is omitted for brevity since it is similar to and in fact fundamentally no different from the proof of Theorem 1 Simply speaking we utilize the fact that the channel set U i in 42 is spherically bounded and apply the same argument as in our previous proof to obtain the rank-one result In the proof the only point that needs some attention is to show that the SDR representation of the robust constraints in Problem 22 is tight i.e max h i 010U i 012 i  W  h i   max H i 010V i 004 i  W  H i   where V i is the semideﬁnite-relaxed counterpart of U i in 42 Since U i in 42 is deﬁned by two quadratic constraints it can be veriﬁed using Fact 4 that the above equality holds C The Box Bounded Model Now let us consider the box bounded model U i   h i 010 C N 005 h i   h i 005 007 012 016 i   44 where the channel error is modeled as being elementwisebounded by some given 016 i  0  This model may be useful when the channel is scalar-quantized and fed back to the base station In this case the SDR representation of the robust constraints is no longer tight i.e we only have max h i 010U i 004 i  W  h i  012 max H i 010V i 012 i  W  H i   where V i   H i 010 H N  H i 002 h i h H i  h i 010 C N   H i  jj  2Re   h i  024 j  h i  j     h i  j  2 012 016 2 i j 1 N   in general However Problem 22 recapitulated here as min W 010S K 002 i 1 Tr W i  45a s  t  max H i 010V i 012 i  W  H i  012 0 i 1 K 45b is still useful as a safe approximation i.e any feasible solution to Problem 45 is also feasible for the original problem 2 Like the previous cases Problem 45 can be efﬁciently solved By considering the dual of the problem on the LHS of 45b and exploiting zero duality gap it can be shown that the constraints in 45b are equivalent to t i 004 0  012 Q i  Diag t i  r i r H i s i  016 2 i 1 T t i 013 002 0 i 1 K where as before we have Q i  1 005 i W i  002 j 011  i W j  r i  Q i  h i  s i   h H i Q i  h i  002 2 i  Hence Problem 45 can be rewritten as an SDP and once again its solution can be efﬁciently computed via conic optimization software The rank-one result for the box bounded model is as follows Corollary 4 Consider Problem 45 which is a safe approximation of Problem 2 under the channel sets in 44 The rank-one result in Theorem 1 holds if 8 is replaced by 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2 N\016 2  1 K  021 K  1 K 022 005 k k 1 K Again we shall omit the proof of Corollary 4 for brevity The intuitive idea

MA et al  UNRAVELING THE RANK-ONE SOLUTION MYSTERY OF ROBUST MISO DOWNLINK TRANSMIT OPTIMIZATION 1921 VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we provided a rank-one solution analysis for a robust multiuser MISO transmit optimization problem Our result suggested that under some practically reasonable condition the robust problem is guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution Our analysis is based on a novel duality framework developed in this paper The duality result reveals that the robust problem has a strong connection to another problem that takes a maximin form and through that connection we identiﬁed a sufﬁcient condition under which the robust problem must have rank-one solutions We also discussed how the duality result can be applied to several other robust problems that use different channel error models As a future direction it would be interesting to investigate how the duality result can be extended to deal with a wider class of robust transmit optimization problems such as the outage-based robust problems  and the multicell p roblems A PPENDIX A Proof of 9 Let  h i   h i  005  h i 005 2 Wehave 005  002 k  h k 005 2  005  h k 005 2 005  002 k  h k 005 2  005  h k 005 2  min x 010 C K  1 005  F  k x   h k 005 2 025\005  h k 005 2  min y 010 C K y K   1 005  Fy 005 2 004\005  h k 005 2  min 005 y 005 2 1 005  Fy 005 2  Since min 005 y 005 2 1 005  Fy 005 2  002 min   F  for tall or square  F we obtain 9 B Proof of Proposition 1 Let E k denote the event that the k th inequality of 8 is violated i.e 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2 003 2 k 012 1 K  021 K  1 K 022 005 k  Also let E  026 K k 1 E k  which is the event that the sufﬁcient rank-one condition 8 in Theorem 1 is violated Our problem is to prove an upper bound on Pr E   By the union bound we have Pr E  012 K 011 k 1 Pr E k   46 Let us focus on Pr E k   Under the Gaussian distribution assumption in Proposition 1 it can be shown that 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2  007 k 2 U 2 N  K 1  where U d denotes a standard chi-square random variable with d degrees of freedom see 56 Ch 8 Moreo v e r  it is kno wn that Pr U d 012 014d  012 034 014e 1  014 035 d 2  for any 014 010 0  1  see e.g 27 Proposition A Using t he abo v e tw o r esults we get Pr E k r 021 U 2 N  K 1 012 2 003 2 k 007 k 027 1 K  K  1 K  005 k 030 022 Pr 021 U 2 N  K 1 012 2 N  K 1 010 k CUR k 022 012 021 010 k CUR k e 1  010 k CUR k 022 N  K 1  for 010 k CUR k  1  By plugging the above inequality into 46 and using e 1  014 012 e for any 014 010 0  1  we obtain the desired result C Proof of Proposition 4 The proof is by construction Recall the notation  F    h 1   h K   Throughout the proof we shall assume that  F H  F  I N 004 K 47a 002 2 1    002 2 K 005 002 2 005 1    005 K 005 005 47b 003 1    003 K 005 003 1  47c The proof is divided into four steps In Step 1 we determine a condition on 005 003 under which Problem 2 has an optimal solution In Steps 2–3 we prove bounds on the LHS and RHS of 28 respectively In Step 4 we combine the results in the previous steps and identify a case where 28 has strict inequality for a particular setting of N K 005 003  Step 1 We show that Problem 2 has an optimal solution if 005 1 K  1 021 1 003  1 022 2  48 Suppose that Problem 2 has a feasible solution  W  Since the optimal value v 006 of Problem 2 satisﬁes v 006 012 002 i Tr  W i   007  we can write v 006 inf W 010S 002 i Tr W i  s  t  2c  002 i Tr W i  012 R where R 007 satisﬁes 002 i Tr  W i  R  Since the above problem has a continuous objective function and a compact constraint set the optimal value v 006 is attained Our next question is when Problem 2 is feasible Let W i  011  h i  h H i i 1 K
