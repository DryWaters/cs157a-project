1  Abstract  Data mining aims at extraction of previously unidentified information from large databases It can  be viewed as an automated application of algorithms to discover hidden patterns and to extract knowledge from data  Online Analytical Processing OLAP systems on the other hand allow exploring and querying huge datasets in inter active way These OLAP systems are the predominant front-end to ols used in data warehousing environments and the OLAP system’s market has developed rapidly during the la st few years. Several works in the past emphasized the int egration of OLAP and data mining More recently data mining techniques along with OLAP have been applied in dec ision support applications to analyze large data sets in an efficient manner However in order to integrate data mining results with OLAP the data has to be modeled in a particula r type of OLAP schema An OLAP schema is a collection of data base objects including tables views indexes and synon yms Schema generation process was considered a manual tas k but in the recent years research communities reported t heir work in automatic schema generation In this paper we r eviewed literature on the schema generation techniques and highlighted the limitations of the existing works The review reveals that automatic schema generation has never been integrated with data mining Hence we propose a mo del for data mining and automatic schema generation of thre e types namely star snowflake and galaxy Hierarchical clustering technique of data mining was used and schema from t he clustered data was generated We have also develope d a prototype of the proposed model and validated it vi a experiments of real-life data set The proposed mod el is significant as it supports both integration and aut omation process Index Terms Automatic schema Data Mining Hierarchical Clustering, OLAP I I NTRODUCTION LAP technology refers to a set of data analysis techniques to view the data from all of the transactional systems in an interactive way in orde r to support the decision-making process The growing complexity and volumes of the data to be analyzed i mpose new requirements on OLAP systems According to 1  a n d   2   O L A P  s y s t e m s  h a v e  r a p i d l y  gained momentum in both the academic and research communities mainly due to their quick and multidimensional analysis capabilities. It plays a vital role in data analysis to identify the key performance indicators  of business and other application domains. In addition to this it is an essential element of the decision support system and permits decision makers to visualize huge operation al data for consistent and interactive analysis Furthermor e it is becoming more accepted due to the recognition of th e business value of exploring and querying huge amoun ts of data sets in a multi-dimensional way  During the l ast few years OLAP systems are predominant front-end tools used in data warehousing environments and OLAP system’s market grew rapidly However, the growing complexity and volumes of the data to be analyzed impose new requirements on OLAP  systems 3   T h e  m a j o r  c o n t r i b u t i o n  o f  t h i s  p a p e r  i s the attempt of combining OLAP and data mining.

It doesn’t p opulate the actual data in the generated schema In this paper  we are not only generating OLAP schema of three types name ly star  snowflake  and galaxy  our automated schema builder tool provides automation in uploading the data from clustered files to relevant portions of the automat ically generated schema On the basis of these observations and limitations  we proposed a model for automatic schema generation T he proposed model, firstly, integrates OLAP with data mining technique of hierarchical clustering and secondly enables automatic schema generation. A prototype of the pro posed model is developed by using our schema generation algorithms Validation has been done by performing experiments on a real-life data set Experimental results prove th at the proposed automatic schema generation process by integrating OLAP with data mining system can be achie ved which makes significant advancement in the modern automation models The remaining portions of this paper are organized as follows: Section II presents the literature review Section III elaborates the proposed model for automatic schema generation Section IV discusses the implementation  and experimentation details of the developed prototype Finally section V provides conclusions and possible future research directions II LITRATURE REVIEW The purpose of this literature review is to introdu ce and identify the limitations of automatic schema genera tion process by the other researchers. Our focus would b e on the use of hierarchical clustering to automate the proce ss of OLAP schema generation The review is categorized o ver three major themes: \(1\ combining OLAP with data mi ning 2 use of hierarchical clustering with OLAP and  3 automation in OLAP schema generation A Combining OLAP with Data mining Several previous studies 5 6 7 and 8  e m p h a s i z e d  the possibilities and interest of coupling OLAP and Dat a Mining The authors in 24  i n d i c a t e d  t h e  e f f i c i e n c y and effectiveness of integrating data mining into OLAP and OLAM systems.

The study shows that OLAP and data mining when combined together can produce greater benefits in a number of diverse research areas Our proposed work  is similar in terms of combining OLAP and data mining techniques. Our main focus however is on a particula r data mining technique known as Hierarchical Clustering Furthermore, we are using data mining as a pre-proc essing step to get a better understanding of data before p assing it to the automatic schema builder and then generates schema for the OLAP engine In the next section our surve y confines down to the relations of data mining techn iques to hierarchal clustering, and their usages with OLAP B Use of Hierarchical Clustering with OLAP Hierarchical clustering of data is a well know mini ng technique and it has been used by a number of resea rch communities in the past Markl et al 9  s u g g e s t e d  that OLAP performance can be improved by using the Multidimensional Hierarchical Clustering MHC technique. Clustering was introduced as a way to sp eed up query aggregation without additional storage cost f or view materialization The authors identified the problem  with queries which either select a very small set of data o r perform aggregations on a fairly large data set Th e sole contribution of their work is an encoding scheme fo r hierarchical dimensions that enables clustering of data with respect to multiple and hierarchical dimensions. Th e major strength of the work lies in the comparison of thei r MHC technique with the traditional bitmap indexing appr oach on the real world data \(7GB in size\ and finding  an i ncrease in the performance up to the factor of 10 Markl et al.

[12  c l a i m e d the Heuristic Optimization of OLAP in MHC Multidimensionally Hierarchically Clustered databases They identified the problem that commercial relational database management systems use multiple one-dimensional ind exes to process OLAP queries that restrict multiple dime nsions They presented architecture for MHC databases based  on the star schema called CSB star The focus was to  facilitate the user to query the typical star schem a and to formulate the given query for CSB star schema usi ng query processor. The limitation of their work was t hat they only tested a particular class of typical OLAP queries over the CSB star schema to check efficiency Tsois et al 13   p r o p o s e d  c o s t  b a s e d  o p t i m i z a t i o n  of aggregation star queries on hierarchically clustere d data warehouses. Hierarchically clustered data warehouse s were used to apply a cost based method for the optimal application of the pre-grouping transformation Aut hors identified the most suitable algorithms for the ope rations related to pre-grouping and derived detailed cost f ormulas for them It is apparent from the review that various authors  have used hierarchical clustering technique in different  ways with OLAP to improve the functionality and to get b etter analytical results The major difference of the pro posed work with the reviewed work of this section is that the use of hierarchical clustering is to generate hierarcha l clusters to get an insight of the data before passing it fur ther for OLAP operations This mining technique has not been  applied on the cube for archiving cube data or for the optimization of OLAP queries Instead of query optimization OLAP performance has been improved in  terms of cube construction time through the use of hierarchically clustered data In the following section, the work done on the auto mation process of OLAP schema generation is discussed C Automatic OLAP schema generation Hann et al 14   p r o p o s e d  t h e  g e n e r a t i o n  o f  t o o l  s pecific schemata for OLAP from conceptual graphical models  Their work described the design and implementation of the generation component in the context of their own Bablefish data warehouse environment The principle issues of  designing and implementing such an automatic schema  generation component and the possible solutions hav e been discussed by the authors.

A pr ototype named SAMSTAR was presented which was used for the  automatic generation of star schema from an ERD Th e system takes an ERD drawn by ERwin Data Modeler as an input and generates star schemas SAMSTAR displays the resulting star schemas on a computer screen graphic ally With this automatic generation of star schema, this system helps designers reduce their efforts and time in bu ilding data warehouse schemas It is evident from the literature on automatic gene ration of schema that none of the previous works used hierarchically clustering to generate OLAP schema Previous work on automation has a number of limitat ions as well such as support for only one schema type, depe ndency of ER diagram modeling and having to design rule ba sed mechanism before the automation process The work in this paper is different as compared to existing automation works Firstly the results of hierarchical clustering are used to generate any of the three types of schemas Furthermore the work is not limi ted to designing the schema but it also populates the data from the clustered data source to the automatically generate d schema tables In addition to this the schema builder als o communicates with database server and deploys the generated schema in the server as a complete databa se To the best of our knowledge none of these works us ed hierarchically clustered data to generate OLAP sche ma Most of the work is using ER diagrams or conceptual  graphical models to produce only one type of schema which is mostly star schema. Another major limitation in the work is that the tools and techniques used for automatic  generation of schema only draws of identify the str ucture of schema and doesn’t populate the corresponding data in the generated schema. Furthermore, we are not only gene rating OLAP schema of three types namely star snowflake  and galaxy  but our automated schema builder tool provides automation in uploading the data from clustered fil e to relevant portions of the schema This feature along  with 37 


4 other specifications distinguishes the work done in  this paper from the others. Table 1 highlights a summary of the literature review III P ROPOSED M ODEL It is evident from the literature review that none of the research works in the past targeted towards the int egration of OLAP with data mining along with the automation in the schema generation process. A number of authors [5 6, 7, 8 18 and 22   i n  t h e  r e c e n t  y e a r s   h a v e  e m p h a s i z e d  o n  the concept of combination of OLAP and data mining Although this previously reported work justified th e advantages of such combination the major limitatio n in their works is the absence of automatic schema gene ration process We suggest an independent automatic schema generati on layer that fulfils both the requirements of schema generation and transformation of data. Based on the above discussion there is a strong requirement of a sign ificant model that takes the data mining results to automati cally generate schema, transforms mined data in the schem a, and overcomes the existing limitations in schema generation models. Figure 1 depicts the proposed model for aut omatic schema generation using data mining results TABLE I S UMMARY OF LITERATURE REVIEW 38 


Fig 1. Proposed model for automatic schema generati on The elaboration of the layers of the proposed model  is as follows A Data Mining: Pre-Processing Layer This layer is responsible for the data mining proce ss The three components in this layer are as follows Dataset This component represents the data set A large number of data sets exist. This component is respon sible for the selection of a particular data set on which dat a mining is to be performed Hierarchical Clustering Once the data set is selected, the data mining technique which is hierarchical cluster ing is applied in this component on the data. This component also handles clustering parameters which include linkage  method Single Complete or Average clustering directions rows columns both and similarity/dis tance measure Euclidean Manhattan Simple matching for nominal or Pearson correlation coefficient On the  given set of clustering parameters this component produce s the hierarchical clusters Clustered Data The hierarchical clusters generated by the previous component are stored and saved in the form  of clustered data This component of the layer also saves the hierarchy relationship among the data along with th e actual data in each cluster The hierarchically clustered data become the input of the next layer which is respons ible for the automation process of schema generation B Data Mining: Pre-Processing Layer The purpose of this layer is to automate the proces s of schema generation. To achieve this purpose the data mining layer feeds the mined data or clustered data to thi s layer for the generation of schema from clustered data set. T he layer has distinct components and the working of each component is explained as follows Schema Builder It is the major component of schema generation layer. The sole function of this component is to build a particular type of schema for the clustered data set As this component has to perform numerous schema generation activities therefore it has a number of  subcomponents to achieve the purpose of building the s chema The sub-components of the schema builder are as fol lows Clustered Data Reader  This sub-component of the schema builder reads the data generated by the hier archal clustering and save it temporarily for future opera tions Clustered Data Viewer It allows viewing the clustered data read by the reader in the grid view All the c luster hierarchy and the number of records present in each can be viewed through it Schema Generator After the clustered data has been read and viewed the data goes to the component called sc hema generator. The sub-components of the schema generat or are explained below 39 


6 Dimensions and Facts Identifier This is the first subcomponent of the schema generator In the generatio n process of schema the first important step is the identification of dimensions and facts from the clu stered data For this important purpose the data in the sc hema generator goes to the Dimension and facts identifie r, which identifies the dimensions and facts present in the clustered data. It also identifies the cluster hierarchy and the numeric type of data which are the facts or key performance  indicators of the data Dimensions and Facts Separator The identifier component just identifies the various dimension and facts pre sent in the clustered data But in real life the dimension and the facts are to be separated in order to build the schema F or this purpose the Dimension and facts separator splits the identified dimensions and facts to be used for diff erent types of schema generation Schema Type Selector At the stage when dimensions and facts are identified and separated the Schema type selector component handles the designing of a specific type of schema This selector allows the selection of a par ticular type of schema which can be a star, snowflake or ga laxy Warehouse Builder After determining the schema type to be generated the dimensions and facts along with th e specific schema type goes in to another major and c ore unit of schema builder which is called the warehouse bui lder The warehouse builder as its name implies builds a warehouse of a particular schema type and consists of the following main sub-components. The functionality of each of the component in the warehouse builder is descri bed below Dimensional hierarchy handler It is the first component of the warehouse builder and it serves the purpose of handling the hierarchy in the dimensions As the clustered d ata has its own hierarchy and the dimensional data identifi ed and separated previously have to be in some hierarchica l order within each dimension The dimensional hierarchy is  different for different type of schemas that is why  this handler component handles the hierarchy present wit hin each dimension Dimension and fact table creator Because the warehouse builder automatically creates a warehouse in the fo rm of a database so the creation of the dimension and fact table is a must For this reason the dimension and fact table creator takes dimensional hierarchy from the previous compo nent and the facts separated by the separator component and create the tables according to the specific schema type Within each table created for a dimension the hiera rchy structure is determined and created using the hiera rchy handler output, which is different for each type of schema Table relationship manager For each type of schema the referencing of dimension and fact table is differen t. For star schema the dimensions are connected directly In Snowflake schema there exists a normalized relation ship between the dimensions whereas for Galaxy both type s of relationships are being made. To handle this comple xity of relationship among dimension and fact tables create d by the warehouse builder for a specific schema type the t able relationship manager plays its part and manages all kind of relationships among the tables accordingly Data population unit When all the tables are created along with the hierarchy within each dimension and the relationship is being created among the dimensions and fact tables, the data population unit comes into play. T he role of this unit is to load the clustered data in the sche ma intelligently Therefore this unit picks the clust ered data and inserts it in specific columns of the dimension and fact tables so that this data can be used later for the OLAP operations Schema Viewer This component takes the generated schema from the schema generator and gives the view  of the automatically generated schema in the form of s chema diagram IV IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS In this section, based on our implementation, we di scuss in details the steps involved in the implementation of  the proposed model Some tools and technologies have be en used for the implementation of each layer of the pr oposed model. Each step of the implementation phase is dis cussed individually in the following sub sections with the  help of an experiment For the experimental purpose ForestCoverType 23 d a t a  set has been chosen. This data set has 581,012 numb ers of instances and 54 attributes. The attribute breakdow n shows that it has 12 measures or facts with 54 columns of data from which 10 are quantitative variables 4 are bin ary wilderness areas and 40 binary soil type variables  The main purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate th e ability of using the proposed model with a real life data s et A Hierarchical clustering of data The proposed model starts with the layer of data mi ning and the technique used for data mining is the hierarchi cal clustering The first step of the implementation is  the hierarchical clustering of data. To serve the purpo se of step 1, we used Hierarchal Clustering Explorer \(HCE\ too l [24  for generating the hierarchical clusters of data T his tool takes input data file and allows the hierarchical c lustering of given data based on different clustering paramet ers At this point user can select the parameters of his/h er choice to perform specific type of hierarchical clustering  on the data Upon the selection of clustering parameters the data as a result is hierarchically clustered and the hi erarchy details are shown in the HCE tool We fed the ForestCoverType data set to the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer \(HCE\ tool. Various parameters can be set at this stage A visualization map of the 40 


7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
