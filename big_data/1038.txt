Proceedinas of the 2003 IEEE lntemation\222il Symposium on Intelligent Control Houston, Texas  October 5-8.2003 GRG:An Efficient Method For Association Rules Mining on Frequent Closed Itemsets Li Li Donghai Zhai Fan Jin School of Computer and Communication Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University MO6 Chengdu 610031 P.R.CHINA Absmcr-In this paper we propose a graph based algorithm GRG Graph based method for association Rules Generation\for association rules mining using the hquent closed itemsets groundwork Association rules mining often base on kequent itemsets which often generates a large number of redundant itemsets that reduce the efficiency Frequent closed itemsets are subset of hquent itemsets 
but they contain all information of tiquent itemsets The most existing methods of tiquent closed itemsets mining are apriori-based The efficiency of those methods is limited to the repeated database xan and the candidate set generation The new algorithm constn~cts an association graph to represent the frequent relationship between items and recursively generates kequent closed itemsets based on that graph It also constructs a lanice graph of went closed itemsets and generates approximate association rules base on lattice graph It scans the database for only two times and avoids candidate set generation GRG shows good performance both in speed and scale up properties I Introduction The 
discovery of association tula was introduced in 1,2,3 This task consists in determining relationships between sets of items in large databases Let I il...im be the set of items D-={Tl Tz T be the transaction database T k[l  n be a record of transaction it consisted of items from I Let S be an itemset S={i I i 2000 The support of S recorded as supp S is the rate of the transactions that contain itemset S If the support of S is not less than the minimum support threshold S is called kquent itemset An association tule 
r x+y is an implication between two itemsets x and y where x y E I the support of the tule denoted as sup\(x+y is defined as sup\(x~y The confidence of the tule denoted as conf\(x+y is defined as sup w I sup x Association tules mining ofien based on the frequent itemsets mining Frequent itemsets mining also plays an essential roles in other data mining It is well known that frequent itemset mining often generates large number of redundent frequent itemsets which reduces the efficiency of association tules mining or other tasks Instead of mining the complete set of frequent itemsets we can mine the frequent closed 
itemsetsI6\222 The frequent closed itemsets contain all information of frequent itemsets and have the same power as frequent itemsets It will largely reduce the number of redundant itemsets and increase the efficiency of mining task 0-7803-7891-1/03/$17.00 0 2003 IEEE 854 For example, suppose a database contains only the same two transaction Tl={il i2  ilw and T2={il i2  SO The minimum support threshold is 1 2Io0-1 frequent itemsets will be generated They are 223{i ill  ilw il b i9 iloo  til il  ilw This itemsets generate tremendous number of association rules But the only two frequent closed itemsets will be generated They 
are 223{il h  i100 and 223{i1 il  ilm Only one association rule generated from the fre uent closed itemsets It is 223{il i2  i50 in  ilW 171  Definition 1 SI and S are two itemsets S1d2 SI is covered by S2 if and only if any transaction that contains SI also contains S2 It is recorded as SIS Lemmal Let SI Sl SI be itemsets if SIGland S2Gl then SIS Rational Let transaction f contains SI For SI f also contains S2 
for S2Gl so f also contains S From definition I SIGl hold Definition 2 S is a itemset if there does not exist itemset 9 SLY i.e S not covered by any itemset then S is a closed itemset if the support of S is not less than the minimum support threshold then S is a frequent closed itemset Lemma 2 S is a frequent itemset but not closed Then there exists a frequent closed itemset S Sa Rational S is not closed from definition 2 there exists an itemset SI S 5 SI If SI is a closed itemset, then from supp SI 9 SI 
is a frequent closed itemset If SI is not closed for the same reason there exists an itemset SI SISSzs Since the length of itemsets is limited we can find itemset S Sk.,SSk from lemma 1 S S S  Lemma 3 S is a frequent itemset, and then S is a frequent closed itemset if and only if S is not covered by any other frequent closed itemset Rational 1 is a frequent closed itemset and then S is not covered by any itemsets So it is not covered by any frequent closed itemsets 2 is a frequent itemset If S is not closed, from lemma 2 there must exists a frequent closed itemset that cover it 


That conflict to the condition When the concept of frequent closed itemset is introduced the mining task is substantially reduced The frequent closed itemset mining is very important to association rules mining or some other tasks This paper studies the efficient mining of association rules on frequent closed itemsets in large databases and proposes a new algorithm called GRG Nicolas Pasquier proposes an Apriori-based mining algorithm called A J.Pei proposes a FP-tree based algorithm called CL0SEen Algorithm A-close and CLOSET is taken as comparison in this paper From the performance study, the new algorithm shows good performance both in speed and scale up properly TID 100 200 300 400 500 When the bit-vectors have been initiated it is not necessary to scan the database anymore In the gmph construction phase GRG algorithm constructs an association graph to indicate the rdationships between frequent items For the association graph if the number of Is in BV,ABV  i  j according to an order L of frequent items is not less than the minimum support threshold a directed edge from item i to item j is constructed, which is recorded as i 3 j The edge between i j means the itemset i,j is a frequent 2-itemset Let the order be L={1,2,3,4,5 the association graph for the above example is shown in figure 1 and the frequent 2-items are 1,3 1,5 2,4 2,5 4,5 BV 0101 1 Itemset 245 13 245 135 145 BVJ=\(\222OI 01 0 Figure 1  The Association Grapb of Frequent Items B The generation of frequent closed itemsets When the graph has been constructed, the frequent closed itemsets can be mined recursively based on the bit-vectors and the association graph The following lemmas are proposed Lemma 4 Let  i i2    be a frequent itemset.

The purpose of using the parameter BV and nawp in function MineSamePrefixFreq is to acquire the bit-vector and the support of itemset I\222s extension conveniently Using the two parameters we can avoid generating bit-vector and support of new itemset from the beginning Theorem 2 Algorithm GRG can finds out all frequent closed itemsets and all association rules on frequent closed itemsets ProoEFrom the lemma 3 itemset I is a frequent closed itemset if and only if I not covered by any other frequent closed itemset That means I is neither covered by any frequent closed itemset in S nor covered by any frequent closed itemset in Sah Fmm lemma 8 if I is not covered by any itemset of extended itemset cluster of I we can say I is not covered by any frequent closed itemset in S.k In function MineSamePrefixFreq\222s 3th step, we set the variable \223covered\224 to FALSE. in 10th step, if I is covered by any itemset of the extended itemset cluster of I then set the variable \223covered\224 to TRUE I can\222t be frequent closed itemset S equals to the current set of frequent closed itemsets FC that have been found out If we can confirm that I not covered by any itemset of FC I is frequent closed itemset The function InsmltsmSefToGFc will retum FALSE if the itemset lis found to be covered by other frequent closed itemsets during the insert process From the discussion above GRG can fmds out all the frequent closed itemset Since all frequent closed itemset are found out according to theorem 1 we can fmd out all association rules on lattice graph 111 Experiment evaluation and performance study In this section we present a performance comparison between the GRG algorithm and the Apriori-based algorithm A-closeL6\222 and FP-tree based algorithm CLOSETI\222\222 All of the experiments are performed on 1.7GHz PC machine with 256 megabytes main memoly running on Microsoft Windows Me All the program are written in Microsow Visual Ctc6.0 The data set used for performance study include one real data set and two synthetic data sets The real data set is the Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM database which has 1378 prescription records each prescription has several drugs The synthetic data sets are generated using the procedure described in l The parameters of the synthetic data sets are described in table 1 We first test the speed property of the two algorithms on the real and synthetic data set by changing the minimum support threshold The results of the experiments are shown in figure 2 3 and 4 Then we test the scale up property of the two algorithms by fixing the minimum support threshold to specified value I and changing the size of the data set The results of the experiments are shown in figure 5 All the response time only include the period of mining frequent closed itemset From the above mentioned performance study, we can see that GRG algorithm has good performance both in speed and scale-up property The good performance of GRG comes from the following reasons Firstly GRG adopts the technique of bit vector which substantially compresses the information of the transaction database Secondly the construction of association graph makes the algorithm avoid candidate set generation The generation of new frequent closed itemset can be guided by the association graph efficiently Furthermore by the conshuction of graph the times of database scan are substantially reduced Only twice database scans are needed. Finally the concept of extended itemset cluster also reduces the search space when judge weather one frequent itemset is closed Parameter Total item 1000 1000 I OK IV Conclusion For the task of mining association rules on frequent closed itemsets this paper proposes a graph-based algorithm named GRG The new algorithm adopts the technique of bit-vector and constructs an association graph to represent the frequent relationships between frequent items The GRG generates frequent closed itemsets based on that association graph of fiequent items GRG also introduces lattices graph of frequent closed itemsets for the association rules mining The experiment evaluation and performance study on real data set and synthetic data set show that the new algorithm has good performance both in speed and scale up property Fig.7 Performancc test using TCM Dataset 858

some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
