On Ef?ciently Capturing Scienti?c Properties in\nDistributed Big Data without Moving the Data:\nA Case Study in Distributed Structural Biology using MapReduce\nBoyu Zhang?, Trilce Estrada†, Pietro Cicotti‡, Michela Taufer?\n?University of Delaware\n{bzhang, taufer}@udel.edu\n†University of New Mexico\n{estrada}@cs.unm.edu\n‡San Diego Supercomputer Center\n{pcicotti}@sdsc.edu\nAbstract—In this paper, we present two variations of a general\nanalysis algorithm for large datasets residing in distributed mem-\nory systems. Both variations avoid the need to move data among\nnodes because they extract relevant data properties locally and\nconcurrently and transform the analysis problem \(e.g., clustering\nor classi?cation test\nthe two variations using the SDSC’s supercomputer Gordon,\nthe MapReduce-MPI library, and a structural biology dataset of\n100 million protein-ligand records. We evaluate both variations\nfor their sensitivity to data distribution and load imbalance.\nOur observations indicate that the ?rst variation is sensitive to\ndata content and distribution while the second variation is not.\nMoreover, the second variation can self-heal load imbalance and\nit outperforms the ?rst in all the ?fteen cases considered.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDriven by the constant increased in “born digital” data,\ndata-driven computing provides new challenges in data man-\nagement and analysis in the life sciences and in many other\ndisciplines ranging from logistics \(traf?c analysis sociology\n\(social media because dealing with millions\nof individual records and terabytes of data. State-of-the-art\nanalysis methods based on clustering and classi?cations for tra-\nditional simulations often require the comparison of complex\ndata records in an iterative process. When very large amounts\nof data records are distributed across a large number of nodes\nof a distributed memory system, the movement and comparison\nof data can have a signi?cant impact on the speed with which\nthe system can complete an analysis [1]. New methodologies\nare needed to analyze data when it is distributed across nodes\nof large distributed memory systems.\nWe propose a methodology that allows the effective man-\nagement and analysis of large datasets composed of millions\nof individual data records in a distributed manner on large\ndistributed memory systems. Our methodology overcomes the\ndif?culties associated with two existing extremes: a centralized\ndata distribution system based on a database or central data\nstore and, at the other end of the extremes, a fully distributed\ndata management system \(such as those in used in many\nMapReduce-based data implementations exchanges of data properties or property\naggregates among the nodes of the distributed memory system,\nrather than the need to move and compare data records\nduring every step of the analysis. The key step consists\nof a data reshaping that is applied to each individual data\nrecord concurrently. This step projects relevant extracted data\nproperties into a type of metadata. We implement two different\nmethods to manage and analyze the reshaped data. In the ?rst\nvariation, called GlobalToLocal, the extracted properties are\nmoved across nodes to build a global view of the dataset; these\nproperties are iteratively and locally analyzed while searching\nfor some class or cluster convergence. In the second variation\ncalled LocalToGlobal, partial properties are analyzed locally\non each node to generate a property aggregate, which is a\nscalar number that summarizes local properties of the data.\nIn this variation, instead of exchanging extracted properties,\nLocalToGlobal only exchanges a few scalar property aggre-\ngates across the nodes. Both approaches are based on the\ngeneral theme of moving computation to the data. We integrate\nthe two variations of our algorithm into the MapReduce\nparadigm [2] and use them to study a complex structural\nbiology dataset of millions of ligand molecules. We test the two\nvariations using the Gordon SDSC \(San Diego Supercomputer\nCenter  million ligand records.\nTo sum up the key contributions of this paper are threefold:\n• We present a general methodology to encode proper-\nties of datasets with many data records in a parallel\nmanner when the records are distributed across nodes\nof a distributed memory system such that we can ef-\nfectively capture properties while pursuing scalability.\n• We present two variations of the methodology and\ntheir implementations using the MapReduce paradigm.\n• We compare the performance of the two MapReduce\nimplementations for a complex dataset of 100 million\nligand records on the SDSC Gordon Supercomputer.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II\nprovides a brief overview on how traditional data analysis is\nbeing affected by new distributed data acquisition techniques.\nIn this section we also outline the general methodology pro-\nposed in this paper and how it can bene?t a scenario where\n2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering\n978-0-7695-5096-1/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.28\n117\ndata is collected in a decentralized way. Section III shows\na case study where our methodology is applied to structural\nbiology datasets residing in large distributed memory systems.\nSection IV presents our evaluation and results. In particular\nwe thoroughly evaluate performance of two variations of our\nalgorithm. Our results show how the underlying scienti?c\nproblem can affect performance of one of these variations,\nwhile the other preserves its 


ef?cient treatment of the data\nregardless of the logical data distribution. Section V gives an\noverview of related work, and Section VI concludes the paper\nwith a brief discussion and future directions.\nII DISTRIBUTED DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING\nA. Semi-decentralized and fully-decentralized memory systems\nData considered in this paper is composed of a large\nnumber of individual data records and is distributed across\nthe nodes of a large distributed memory system. More specif-\nically, we consider semi-decentralized and fully-decentralized\ndistributed memory systems. In a semi-decentralized system,\nprocesses report to more than one node, usually to the closest\none, and take advantage of locality by reducing expensive data\ntransfer and potential storage pressure. In contrast, in a fully-\ndecentralized system, each node stores its own data which\nreduces the need of data transfers and increases the amount of\nlocally stored data. Logically, the entire dataset can converge\ntoward one or multiple scienti?c properties, or it may not\nconvey any scienti?c information. Physically, data with similar\nscienti?c properties may agglomerate in topologically close\nnodes or may be dispersed across nodes. Logical and physical\ntendencies are not known a priori when data is generated in\nsemi- or fully-decentralized systems. In general, scientists must\nmove data across nodes in order to analyze and understand it.\nThis process can be extremely costly in terms of execution\ntime. For the sake of completeness, we de?ne three scenarios\nthat resemble the challenging conditions faced by scientists\nwhen dealing with distributed systems with large amounts of\ndata. The scenarios consist of data distributed in:\n• a semi-decentralized manner in which data with sim-\nilar properties are generated by and stored in speci?c\nnodes;\n• a fully-decentralized, synchronous manner in which\ndata is gathered at regular intervals producing a uni-\nform distribution of data properties across the nodes\nin a round-robin fashion; and\n• a fully-decentralized, asynchronous manner in which\nevery node acts by itself and properties are stored\nrandomly across nodes.\nB. From data records to properties and property aggregates\nWe address the data analysis in the three aforementioned\nscenarios by moving the computation to the data. We accom-\nplish this by keeping the scienti?c data on the node where it\nwas originally generated and rede?ne the analysis algorithm\nto move the analysis to the data. When we analyze scienti?c\ndata e.g., for clustering or classi?cation, we often focus on\nspeci?c properties. For example, when dealing with structural\nbiology datasets, properties include molecular geometries or\nlocation of a molecule in a pocket. These properties can\nbe captured and encoded across the dataset concurrently by\nanalyzing each single data record independently. In this case,\nprocessing large datasets can be decoupled into a preprocessing\nto extract concise properties that can be represented as meta-\ndata, followed by the analysis of the extracted properties to\npro?le scalar property aggregates. Across scienti?c domains,\nthere is not a single way to extract properties. In this paper, we\nuse a method for capturing molecular geometries in structural\nbiology datasets based on projections and linear interpolations.\nThis method effectively reduces dimensionality of each dis-\ntributed data record in a parallel manner without any data\nmovement across nodes. Hence, we can effectively and accu-\nrately capture data properties while pursuing scalability. The\nanalysis is applied to the extracted properties rather than the\nwhole scienti?c dataset. Note that we implicitly transform the\nanalysis problem from a clustering or classi?cation problem\non scienti?c data into a search on extracted properties. Now\nthat we no longer need to move the scienti?c data, the next\nchallenge confronts ways to study the extracted properties in an\nef?cient distributed manner. The analysis operations applied\nto our dataset are associative and commutative \(e.g., sum or\nmaximum property values generate local\nscalar property aggregates \(SPAs be exchanged less frequently\nor SPAs can be exchanged more frequently across nodes to\nrebuild a global view of the data scienti?c meaning. Although\nextracted properties may be larger than SPAs, both properties\nand SPAs are smaller than the original scienti?c data.\nIII. CASE STUDY: STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY DATASETS\nA. Scienti?c datasets\nIn studies of disease processes, a common problem is to\nsearch for small molecules \(ligands interact with\na larger molecule such as a protein when the protein is\ninvolved in a disease state. More speci?cally, when ligands\ndock well in a protein, they can potentially be used as a\ndrug to stop or prevent diseases associated with the protein’s\nmalfunction. This is a common type of analysis done in\ndrug development research. In this paper, as an example\nof its applicability, we apply our methodology to structural\nbiology datasets containing large numbers of ligand conforma-\ntions from protein-ligand docking searches Computationally, a\nprotein-ligand docking search seeks to ?nd near-native ligand\nconformations in a large dataset of conformations that are\ndocked in a protein [4]. A conformation is considered near-\nnative if the Root-Mean Square Deviation \(RMSD the experimentally observed conformation.\nAlgorithmically, a docking simulation consists of a sequence of\nindependent docking trials. An independent docking trial starts\nby generating a series of random initial 


ligand conformations;\neach conformation is given multiple random orientations. The\nresulting conformations are docked into the protein-binding\nsite. Hundreds of thousands of docking attempts are performed\nconcurrently Molecular dynamics simulated annealing is used\nto search for low energy conformations of the ligand on\nthe protein pocket. Traditionally, docked conformations with\nminimum energy are assumed to be near-native However, it\nhas been shown that this is not always the case [1]. Docked\n118\nconformations with minimum energy are not necessarily near-\nnative. In previous work, we showed that compact clusters\nof docked conformations grouped by their geometry are more\nlikely to be near-native than the individual conformations with\nlowest energy [1]. Large numbers of ligand conformations\nwere sampled through Docking@Home \(D@H ve years and are used in this paper as the dataset of\ninterest. very large number of docked ligand conformations\nthat have to be compared to each other in terms of their\ngeometry.\nTraditionally, a na?¨ve approach used to group similar\nstructural biology conformations is through geometry-based\nclustering. Such technique requires that data is stored in a\ncentralized location in order to compute the Root-Mean Square\nDeviation of each ligand with all the other ligands in the\ndataset. The analysis requires the molecular dataset to be\nmoved entirety into a central server. Figure 1 shows an abstract\nrepresentation of a centralized data analysis system in which\nall the ligands have to be moved to a local storage where\nthey can be compared and clustered. This fully centralized\napproach is not scalable and can result in serious storage and\nbandwidth pressure on the server side. Thus, the challenge\ninvolves ways to ef?ciently ?nd these dense ligand clusters of\ngeometric representations, especially when the data is acquired\nin a distributed way. While each conformation is small \(of the\norder of ten Kbytes the distributed memory system and have\nto be compared to each other is extremely large; depending on\nthe type and number of proteins, the conformation dataset can\ncomprise tens or hundreds of millions of ligands. This scenario\nis expected when thousands of processes perform individual\ndocking simulations and store their results locally. Thus, in\nthis paper we analyze the scenarios where data is generated\nand partially analyzed in a semi- and fully-decentralized way,\ntaking advantage of the large distributed compute power and\nstorage of Gordon at SDSC.\nData \nmovement \nNode 0 Node 1 \nC\nen\ntra\nliz\ned\n d\nat\na \nan\nal\nys\nis\n  \nD\nis\ntri\nbu\nte\nd nda\nta\n \nge\nne\nra\ntio\nn \nan\nd \nst\nor\nag\ne \nFig. 1: Traditional centralized comparison and clustering of\nlarge datasets generated on a distributed memory system.\nB. Capturing relevant properties\nOur preprocessing of docking simulation results requires\nus to extract the geometrical shape \(property the docking pocket of a protein. In this process\nwe perform a space reduction from the scienti?c data atom\ncoordinates of the ligand conformations compressed values representing ligand geometries\nin the docking pocket on calculations involving the\nwhole or partial dataset as do most traditional algorithms, such\nas k-means and Fuzzy c-means clustering. On the contrary,\nour space reduction is applied individually to each ligand\nconformation by transforming each molecule containing p\natomic coordinates in the three-dimensional space \(p × 3 1× 3 3-dimensional space of property-encoding points summarized as follows: Given a ligand with p atomic\ncoordinates \(xi, yi, zi, with i from 1 to p a\nprojection of the coordinates in their respective 3 planes \(x, y y, z z, x results in a set of 2D points\non the associated 2D plane. For each projection, we compute\nthe best-?t linear regression line over the projected points.\nWe use the coef?cient of each model as a coordinate of the\n3-dimensional point to encode the conformational geometry\nof its corresponding ligand. Our space reduction has the\ndesired property of projecting ligands with a similar geometry\ncloser into the newly de?ned 3-dimensional space. Thus, the\nconverged cluster is the one with the highest density of points.\nBy dealing with property-encoding points rather than raw\natom coordinates, we implicitly transform the analysis problem\nfrom a clustering or classi?cation problem into a property ag-\ngregate search. Extracted properties can be unpredictably dis-\ntributed across the 3-dimensional space of property-encoding\npoints and across the nodes of the distributed memory system.\nThus, the next challenge we face is how to ef?ciently count the\naggregates of close property-encoding points in a distributed\nway, that is, how to generate a scalar property aggregate\n\(SPA general algorithmic variations,\ni.e., GlobalToLocal and LocalToGlobal. In GlobalToLocal,\nthe extracted properties are exchanged among nodes across\nthe distributed memory system to rebuild a global view of\nthe information content in the scienti?c data so that similar\nproperties eventually reside on the same node or nodes that\nare topologically close to each other \(Figure 2.a the property-encoding\npoints are not moved from their original system nodes. Prop-\nerty densities, used as 


SPAs, are then iteratively counted locally\nwhile searching for convergence. In LocalToGlobal, instead of\nexchanging extracted properties, nodes exchange partial densi-\nties representing a scalar property aggregate \(Figure 2.b and counts its densities before shuf?ing them with\nother nodes.\nC. Counting property densities\nFor the sake of ef?ciency, in both variations we reshape the\n3-dimensional space of property-encoding points into an octree\nand search for the densest octants that contain the solution\nto our analysis problem. Our search for dense octants \(or\nproperties subdividing the 3-dimensional\nspace into octants \(the nodes of the octree n \n \n \n \nNode 0 Node 1 \nEncode  \nproperties \n---- \nCount  \ndensities \n\(SPAs nproperties \n\(a GL nCount  \ndensities \n\(SPAs SPAs b LG of exchange of properties in the GlobalToLocal variant and exchange of scalar property aggregations in the\nLocalToGlobal variant.\neach process exploring its octree, i.e., moving up or down\nalong the tree branches depending on whether a dense enough\noctant is found or not. During the search, nodes may exchange\neither extracted properties or scalar property aggregates based\non which variation of the algorithm is used. As shown in\nFigures 2.a and 2.b, in both variations, each node transforms\nits local data into the 3-dimensional space as described in the\npreprocessing step above. Since nodes work on disjointed data,\nthey can perform the space reduction locally and concurrently.\nThe local property-encoding points can populate the space\nin an unpredictable way, for example, they can reside across\nmultiple subspaces; each node has a disjointed vision of the\nwhole space. In GlobalToLocal, the extracted properties are\ncommunicated among nodes so that each one has all the\ninformation needed to analyze similar properties globally. The\nanalysis is applied to each node’s local properties iteratively. In\nLocalToGlobal, after the data preprocessing, each node applies\nthe data analysis operation to its local extracted properties and\ncomputes scalar property aggregates based on densities. The\nSPAs are communicated among nodes so that each node has all\nthe partial results that it needs to analyze the density globally.\nAn aggregate operation \(i.e., sum Communications of properties and aggregates are done\niteratively: communication in GlobalToLocal happens only\nonce and the communicated package is larger in size while\ncommunication in LocalToGlobal happens multiple times and\neach time the communicated package is smaller in size. The\nMapReduce paradigm naturally accommodates the capturing\nof properties from local data and the iterative search for\neither properties or densities in its Map and Reduce functions\nrespectively. Thus, we integrated our two variants into the\nMapReduce-MPI framework rather than implementing a new\nMPI-based framework from scratch.\nIV. TESTS AND EVALUATION\nA. Platform setup\nThe platform used in this work is Gordon, a Track 2\nsupercomputer at SDSC, which is allocated as an XSEDE\nresource. Gordon is ideal for our work because it features a\n?ash memory storage private to each compute node that can be\nused to simulate a fully distributed memory system. We use 64\nGordon compute nodes, each of which contains two 8-core 2.6\nGHz Intel EM64T Xeon E5 \(Sandy Bridge and mounts a single 300 GB SSD.\nThe nodes are connected by a 4 × 4 × 4 3-dimensional torus\nwith adjacent switches connected by three 4× QDR In?niBand\nlinks. We integrated the GL and LG algorithms in MapReduce-\nMPI 3].\nB. Data setup\nWe generate ?ve synthetic datasets from real Dock-\ning@Home data to ?t speci?c property distributions in the\n3-dimensional space \(logical distributions conclusions in terms of convergence\ntowards speci?c ligand geometries. Each of the dataset consists\nof 100 million ligands and is 250GB in size. We also distribute\nthe datasets across the nodes’ storage \(physical distribution Section II.\nC. Logical distribution\nThe information latent in data can have different contents\nand meanings For example, the collected ligands may more\nor less strongly converge toward a single similar geometry\nor may not converge at all. This is re?ected in the extracted\n120\nproperties and the distribution of property-encoding points in\nthe 3-dimensional space. We consider ?ve scenarios with ?ve\ndifferent scienti?c conclusions. In the ?rst scenario with one\ndense cluster \(1D strongly converges toward one ligand conformation; the\n3-dimensional points densely populate one small region of the\nspace while most of the remaining space is empty. We select\nligands from the D@H dataset whose geometries generate 3-\ndimensional points with normal distribution around one point\nin the 3-dimensional space with standard deviation equaling\n0.1 for this scenario. In the second scenario with one sparse\ncluster \(1S the information content in the data more loosely\nconverges toward one ligand conformation; the 3-dimensional\npoints sparsely populate one larger region of the space. The\nligand geometries generate points with normal distribution\naround one point in the 3-dimensional space with standard\ndeviation equaling one. In 


the third scenario with two dense\nclusters \(2D 2S extend the ?rst and second scenarios by presenting\nscienti?c cases in which information in the data either strongly\nor loosely converge toward two major conformations rather\nthan one. More speci?cally, in the third scenario, ligand\ngeometries are mapped onto points with normal distribution\naround two separate points with standard deviation equaling\n0.1; in the fourth scenario, we generate points with normal\ndistribution around two separate points with standard deviation\nequaling 0.5. In the ?fth and last scenario with a uniform\ndistribution of the information \(UN conclusion; no single\nligand conformation was repeatedly generated. This scenario\ncan happen, for example with insuf?cient sampling or the\ninaccurate mathematical modeling.\nD. Physical distribution\nTo simulate the distributed datasets when generated in\nsemi- or fully-decentralized systems, we consider three differ-\nent physical distributions of the data across the nodes of Gor-\ndon: Uniform, Round-Robin, and Random. \(1 uniform\nphysical distributions, property-encoding points that belong to\nthe same subspace in the logical distribution are located in the\nsame physical storage. This scenario happens most likely in a\nsemi-decentralized distribution in which points mapping close\nproperties are collected by the same node or topologically close\nnodes; hence, there is uniformity of the property-encoding\npoints inside the nodes storage. \(2 distribution are stored in separate physical storage in\na round-robin manner. This scenario happens most likely in a\nfully-decentralized, synchronous distribution in which points\nare collected at each prede?ned time interval; hence, the data\npoints for each time interval are stored in separate storage\nacross the distributed system. \(3 the system nodes. This scenario simulates the fully-\ndecentralized asynchronous manner. In each of the scenarios,\nthe whole dataset is roughly evenly distributed among the 64\nphysical storage, giving to each one of the physical storage\naround 1.6 million ligand con?rmations.\nFigure 3 shows the total time in seconds aggregated across\nall processes GL LG distributions \(i.e., one dense cluster\n1D, two dense clusters 2D, one sparse cluster 1S, and uniform\nUN one of the three physical distributions \(i.e., round-\nrobin physical distribution results are\nomitted in the ?gure for space constraints but convey the\nsame conclusions. All the results are included in the discussion\nbelow and the complete set of times is reported in Table I in the\nappendix. The total time across the 1024 Gordon’s cores is cut\ndown in four time components, i.e., Map, Shuf?e, Overhead\nand Reduce. Map includes the time a process spends extract-\ning properties during the preprocessing and searching across\nsubspaces in the tree. Shuf?e is the time spent exchanging\nproperties in GlobalToLocal or densities in LocalToGlobal.\nOverhead is the time introduced by the MapReduce-MPI\nlibrary for either synchronizing processes at the end of each\nMapReduce step or for awaiting certain processes to complete\ntheir Map or Reduce in case of load imbalance. Reduce is the\ntime to aggregate properties in GlobalToLocal or the time to\naggregate densities in LocalToGlobal. In the ?gure, we report\nthe average execution time in seconds over three runs; the time\ntraces are obtained by using TAU [5]. We instrumented the\nsource code so only a limited number of events are measured\nby TAU; thus, the overhead introduced by TAU is negligible.\nE. Results and discussion\nFor all but the uniform logical distributions \(UN distribution of properties in the dataset and a substantial\noverhead is reported compared to LocalToGlobal i.e., up to\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than LocalToGlobal when prop-\nerties \(points around one or two small\nregions of interest \(one dense cluster 1D and two dense clusters\n2D cluster 1D and two dense clusters 2D\nscenarios require relocating all the properties \(3-dimensional\npoints one or two processes respectively, on which the\niterative search is performed locally. When points are sparsely\ndistributed \(one sparse cluster 1S and two sparse cluster 2S tangible but smaller than for\none dense cluster 1D and two dense clusters 2D, i.e., up to one\norder of magnitude larger than in LocalToGlobal. Note that\nscenarios like one dense cluster 1D and two dense clusters 2D\nare scienti?cally meaningful because the information content\nof the science strongly converges toward a few conclusions; for\nGlobalToLocal this is associated to high total times due to the\nload imbalance and ultimately poor performance. On the other\nhand, LocalToGlobal performs similarly across scenarios \(one\ndense cluster 1D one sparse cluster 1S, two dense clusters\n2D, and two sparse clusters 2S magnitudes regardless of the embedded scienti?c results\nand the physical distributions. When looking at the other\ntime components, both GlobalToLocal and LocalToGlobal total\nMap times are similar in size; both variations perform similar\npreprocessing. The GlobalToLocal total Reduce times are two\norders of magnitude larger than the equivalent LocalToGlobal\ntimes; LocalToGlobal has been simpli?ed to sum single density\nvalues 


SPAs have\ndifferent Shuf?e times with dense scenarios taking longer than\nsparse scenarios. This is because shuf?ing all the properties\nto one or two processes for the global analysis, as in the\ncase of dense scenarios, takes more time than shuf?ing the\nsame properties to a larger subset of processes.

For each sub?gure, each process time in the two\nbars is normalized with respect to the longest process time\nfor both GlobalToLocal \(GL LG This\nallows us to better compare the two variations. Figure 4\nshows that overheads have two components: \(1 much larger\ncomponent that is present in GlobalToLocal only and is due\nto load imbalance and \(2 component that is present\nin both variations and is due to a collective communication\nembedded into MapReduce-MPI when synchronizing all the\nprocesses.

The\nsynchronization time for the 1024 processes is similar for the\ntwo variations, is negligible compared to the other overhead\ncomponent in GlobalToLocal, and can take up to 20% of the\ntotal time in LocalToGlobal. Both Figures 3 and 4 convey\nthe important ?ndings that LocalToGlobal is able to perform\nimplicit load balancing regardless of the logical and physical\ndata distributions.\nV. RELATED WORK\nThe MapReduce paradigm has been used in the past to\nanalyze large data. For example, the paradigm was adapted\nto analyze long MD trajectories in parallel with the tool\nHiMach [6]. Work in [6] includes the design and use of a\nMapReduce-style programming interface to exclusively ana-\nlyze statistical data of long trajectories.

A similar clustering approach\nbased on the density of single points in an N-dimensional\nspace was presented in the work of Cordeiro el al. [9]. The\nthree algorithms presented in Cordeiro’s work rely on local\nclustering of sub-regions and the merging of local results\ninto a global solution \(which can potentially suffer from\naccuracy issues considers\nthe whole dataset and performs a single-pass analysis on it.\nContrary to [9], when using the LG variation we no longer\nobserve a correlation between space density and clustering\nef?ciency. Milletti and Vulpetti [10] perform a geometry-\nbased abstraction of molecular structures. Speci?cally, they\npro?le protein-binding pockets by using a shape-context-based\nmethod. This method describes the coarse distribution of the\n123\npocket shape with respect to a given point in its geometry.\nThe shape-context method is linear in the number of atoms\nconsidered to generate a pocket descriptor and to perform the\ninhibition map prediction However, the overall methodology\npresented in [10] is not practical for the clustering of other\ndatasets. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the\n?rst to emphasize a local, single pass of data to extract global\nproperties or densities and, by doing so, to avoid major data\nmovements. In our work, scalability plays a key role and is\nparticularly well supported by the LG variant. Our approach\nexpands our previous work [1 Here we use MapReduce-\nMPI rather than Hadoop to move away from the overhead\nof the Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS operation time to move in and out data.\nWe also extend the previous algorithm into two variations for\nfully distributed environments. In the variations, data no longer\nneeds to be moved a priori with HDFS, making our approach\ncompletely scalable. These variations allow us to study the\nperformance impact of exchanging extracted properties in con-\ntrast to exchanging property densities; this was not achievable\nin Hadoop due to the coarse grain control on data placement\nof HDFS.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper focuses on avoiding data movement when\nanalyzing scienti?c datasets composed of a large number of\ncomplex data records distributed across multiple nodes of a\nlarge distributed memory system. We present two variations\nof a general algorithm for data analysis \(i.e., clustering or\nclassi?cation Both\nvariations perform a local, single preprocessing pass of the\ndata to extract relevant properties, i.e the geometry of a ligand\nconformation in a large dataset of 100 million con?rmations. In\nthe GlobalToLocal variation we exchange extracted properties\nrather than data, in the LocalToGlobal variation, we exchange\nscalar property aggregates. The latter are usually smaller than\nproperties but require a higher number of exchanges.\nWe evaluate the performance of the two variations on\n1024 cores under ?fteen different scenarios by combining ?ve\ndifferent clustering con?gurations and three different physical\ndistributions of the data. From the performance point of view,\nwe observe that GlobalToLocal is very sensitive to the infor-\nmation content of the analyzed datasets, while LocalToGlobal\nis not. We observe that when exchanging scalar property aggre-\ngate, our approach delivers scalable performance and is largely\ninsensitive to the contents of the datasets. In other words, the\ntime to perform analyses and extract the information in the\ndataset is not impacted by the number of clusters, their shapes,\nor the way the data is distributed across the local storage.\nWe also observe that by moving the computation to the data\nlocation as in LocalToGlobal any load imbalance resulting\nfrom the way the scienti?c content of datasets are randomly\ngenerated and distributed is minimized. Hence, LocalToGlobal\noverall outperforms GlobalToLocal. Our variations are appli-\ncable to diverse scienti?c datasets beyond the one considered\nin this paper and can result in scienti?c analyses that are not\nsensitive to data content and distribution.\nFuture work includes adapting our methodology to capture\na broader set of properties in large datasets from other scienti?c\ndomains such as astronomy for which we want to analyze\nspectra to classify galaxy in terms of ages. We believe that\nwhile we here demonstrated our approach for one speci?c\ndataset in structural biology and implemented in MapReduce-\nMPI, it is applicable to a many scienti?c analyses and other\ndistributed frameworks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is supported in part by NSF grants: DMS\n0800272/0800266, IIS 0968350, and CNS 1318417.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
