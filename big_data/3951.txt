Fast Solution of Load Shedding Problems via a Sequence of Linear Programs Harish S Bhat Garnet J Vaz and Juan C Meza Applied Mathematics Unit University of California Merced Merced CA USA email hbhat@ucmerced.edu Abstract Given a power network consisting of nodes generators/loads and edges lines there exist a set of constraints that must be satisìed in order for the system to be operational When one or more power lines are cut the bus phases and load/generator power values may need to be altered in order to restore the system to operation The load shedding problem is to nd the smallest adjustment to the loads that achieves this restoration In this work we show how to solve this nonlinear optimization problem by solving a sequence of linear programs On random graphs with 1500 edges we nd that our method is at least 40 times faster than competing nonlinear optimization methods We show that our method is capable of solving load shedding problems for a real graph with 19840 edges and that the method scales with an O  n 2  running time where n is the number of edges For real subgraphs with hundreds of edges we are able to rapidly solve all possible load shedding problems in which at most two lines are deleted This work takes a rst step towards a scalable load shedding algorithm capable of handling large networks that will arise in the future Keywords load shedding power network nonlinear optimization sequential linear programming I I NTRODUCTION Electric power grids are commonly modeled using graphs that may contain thousands of edges and nodes The nodes in these graphs represent generators and loads while the edges represent power lines Given such a graph one seeks algorithms to analyze the power systemês vulnerability and to improve its robustness The proliferation of smart grid technologies gives us the ability to collect data on power consumption and generation on small length scales such as individual buildings and rooms This will only increase the size of power networks that must be modeled and optimized When we examine algorithms for analyzing network vulnerability there is a large gap between the capabilities of current methods and the massive network sizes that we may expect to confront in the future Here we focus on the load shedding problem ifwe cut a set of lines from the power network what is the minimal load that must be shed from the system to restore its operation We are interested in developing an algorithm for solving this problem that scales well to large networks Viewed as an optimization problem the load shedding problem is a nonlinear program In this paper we reformulate the nonlinear program as a sequence of linear programs SLP This reformulation enables us to solve the load shedding problem more rapidly than if we apply off-the-shelf interior point or sequential quadratic programming codes to the original nonlinear program We also analyze real data obtained from the Western Electricity Coordinating Counci l WECC This data set a proposed power grid model for the year 2021 consists of a network of 17452 nodes and 19840 edges First we analyze two subgraphs with hundreds of edges for these subgraphs we exhaustively solve load shedding problems for all possible deletions of one and two edges These collections of thousands of nonlinear programs are solved on the order of minutes using a single laptop computer In this way we are able to rapidly assess the robustness of these subgraphs Second we show performance results using a Python Numpy/Scipy implementation of the SLP approach The results show that it is possible to solve one load shedding problem on the entire WECC graph in approximately 10 3 seconds on a single laptop computer By considering subgraphs of the WECC graph we also show that the load shedding running time scales as O  n 2  where n is the number of edges in the graph Note that the presence of the sine nonlinearity in our load shedding problem is due to the fact that we analzye a dynamic/active or alternating current AC formulation of the problem 2 Li near v e rs i ons of t h e p robl em t h at assume a direct current DC or static formulation have been solved by algorithms that scale well to graphs with thousands of nodes and edges More generally linear programming has been successfully applied to solve optimization problems with millions of variables and constraints We expect that the SLP formulation of the load shedding problem will enable in forthcoming work the analysis of the entire WECC graph and other large graphs that arise II M ODEL We model a power network using a directed graph with m buses nodes and n lines edges Let A be the n  m arc-incidence matrix for this graph and let B be a diagonal n  n matrix containing all line admittances For each line we deìne  i to be 0 respectively 1 fthelineisinservice 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 1

the CFE and IID subgraphs respectively this corresponds to 220 and 76 two-line cuts Together with the fact that the k 2 solutions are far to the right of the black lines this indicates that computing the k 2 solutions is important B Scalability Next we describe results for a Python implementation of SLP II We call CPLEX using its Python API in order to solve each linear program in the sequence This Python/CPLEX implementation is able to solve load shedding problems for the entire WECC network The calculations in this section were carried out using a single laptop computer This computer has a 1.6GHz Intel Core i7-Q720 chip with 4 GB of memory We used Python 2.7.3 on the Ubuntu 12.10 operating system with Numpy 1.6.2 and Scipy 0.12.0 Starting with the entire WECC graph with 19840 edges we randomly select subgraphs with 620  1240  2480  4960  and 9920 edges For each such subgraph we knock out two lines solve the load shedding problem and record the running time in seconds All results are averaged over 10 such runs In Figure 3 we plot the running time T versus the number of edges n  The axes on this plot have been scaled logarithmically with base 2  The least-squares line of best t therefore indicates log 2 T  20  2432  2  097 log 2 n  providing empirical evidence that the running time for SLP II is O  n 2   For the line of best t the adjusted R 2 value is 0  9865  V C ONCLUSION The SLP II method shows much promise for future work If the O  n 2  scaling continues for larger graphs it will be possible to apply this method in a high-performance computing context and thereby solve much more massive load shedding problems than those considered here To plot curves such as in Figure 2 for larger graphs we plan to couple the SLP II method with a method for intelligently sampling the space of all k 2 cuts 8 We have already begun the process of developing a largescale version of our code that can leverage cluster/cloud resources In this way we plan to use the SLP II algorithm to analyze the k 2 contingencies for the full WECC network A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the U.S Department of Energy Contract No DE-AC02-05CH11231 Subaward 7041635 The views and opinions of authors expressed herein do not necessarily state or reîect those of the United States Government or any agency thereof    0.798 2.498 6.974 35.454 209.862 1059.163 620 1240 2480 4960 9920 19840 Number of edges Running time Figure 3 We present a log 2 log 2 plot of running time seconds versus number of edges n for a Python implementation of the SLP II load shedding algorithm The raw data points black are averaged over 10 runs The least-squares line of best t has slope 2  097  indicating that this method has O  n 2  running time R EFERENCES  D Bi enst ock and A V erma T he N  k problem in power grids New models formulations and numerical experiments SIAM Journal on Optimization  vol 20 no 5 pp 2352Ö2380 2010  A  P i n ar  J  M eza V  Donde and B L esi eut re Opt i m i zat i o n strategies for the vulnerability analysis of the electric power grid SIAM Journal on Optimization  vol 20 no 4 pp 1786 1810 2010 3 J  S al mer on K W ood and R  B a l d i ck W or st case i n t e r d i c t i o n analysis of large-scale electric power grids IEEE Transactions on Power Systems  vol 24 no 1 pp 96Ö104 2009 4 J  J  G r a i nger and W  D  S t e v enson Power System Analysis  New York McGraw-Hill 1994  F  P al aci os-Gomez L  L a sdon and M E ngqui st   Nonl i n ear optimization by successive linear programming Management Science  vol 28 no 10 pp 1106Ö1120 1982  J  Z hang N H K i m  a nd L  L a sdon  A n i mpro v e d s uccessi v e linear programming algorithm Management Science  vol 31 no 10 pp 1312Ö1331 1985  V  D onde V  L opez B  L e si eut re A  P i nar  C  Y ang and J Meza Identiìcation of severe multiple contingencies in electric power systems IEEE Transactions on Power Systems  vol 23 pp 406Ö417 2008 8 A  K u m ar an d P  T rip ath i   Reco g n itio n o f c ritical n 2  contingencies in power system using non-linear optimization in Power India Conference 2012 IEEE Fifth  2012 pp 1Ö6 6

 speciìes type of the event its granularity in the subevent hierarchy place time and environment condition We developed an algorithm that evaluates each cue with a number in the range of 0 to 1 as follows event type wrong  0 correct  1 somehow correct  such that is the subevent-granularity level for a predicted tag and is the subevent granularity level for the true-positive tag the predicted tag is the direct or indirect superevent of the true-positive tag i.e  place includes place name category and geographical region If the place name is correct score 1 is assigned and the other attributes will not be checked Otherwise 0 is assigned for the category and/or geographical region if correct score 1 is assigned and 0 otherwise The average of these values represent the score for place for weather optical and visual constraint wrong=0 correct 1 unsure  0.5 time interval if the predicted event tag occurs anytime during the true-positive event tag 1 is the score otherwise 0 The average of the above scores represents the correctness measure for a predicted event tag We introduce of annotation that is calculated using the formula in equation 8 in which is the score for the predicted event tag 8 We also introduced the metric in equation to measure the average context provided by data sources for annotating a photo stream In this equation parameter is the average error related to the information provided by data sources used for annotating a photo stream   the following guidelines are applied automatically to measure this value if the information in a data source is related to the domain of a photo stream but it is irrelevant to the context of the photo stream assign error-score 1 For instance data source returns zero results related to for the country at which a photo stream is created Also if a photo stream for a vacation trip Fig 7 Role of context in improving the correctness of event tags does not include any picture taken in any landmark location does not provide any coverage assign errorscore 0 if the type of a source is relevant as well as its data i.e non-empty results if the data from a relevant source is insufìcient for a photo stream assign error-score 0.5 For instance only a subset of business venues in a region are listed in data source  as a result the data source returns information for less than 30 of the photo stream nally for a data source multiply the error-score by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of photos tagged using this data source and the denominator is the size of the photo stream Do this for all the sources and obtain the weighted average of the error-scores The result is the value for  The implication of our result in g 7 is as follows while the correctness of event tags for a photo stream of an event peaks with the increase in  relatively smaller percentage of photos are tagged using events and larger percentage of photos are tagged using event This means if the suitable event type for a group of photos does not exist in an event ontology the photos are not tagged with an irrelevant event instead they are tagged with event which means  The right side of the gure indicates that even though the number of miscellaneous and non-miscellaneous event tags does not change the correctness is still increasing this means that the tags get more expressive since more context cues are attached to them The quality of annotations is increased when more context information is available This shows that event ontology by itself is not as effective as augmented event ontology We demonstrate three classes of experiments in table I This table shows the average values between 0 to 1 for the measure metrics discussed earlier precision recall F1  We use the work proposed in as a baseline It is based on space and time to detect event boundaries in conjunction with using English album descriptions This baseline approach with F1-measure about 0.6 and correctness of almost 0.56 shows promising results and illustrates that time and space are important parameters to detect event boundaries On the other hand the baseline approach is limited to using only spatiotemporal containment for detecting subevent hierarchy it does not support other types of relationships among events like co-occurring events relative temporal relationships and other semantic knowledge about the structure of events In addition it requires human-induced tags which are noisy For the second set of experiments we use an event domain ontology without augmenting it with context information This approach gives worse results since the context information is disregarded during detecting event boundaries It provides the F1-measure of almost 0.32 and correctness of 0.13 Our last

improvement in the quality of tags which is a very promising result We investigate the running time for event ontology augmentation and visual concept veriìcation in g 8 through a two-stage process described below Fig 8 illustrates the results for data sets of two sources i.e lab and non-lab including Flickr and Picasaweb and three event domains In general we found smaller number of context sources for wedding data sets compared to the other two domains as a result the event ontology augmentation process exits relatively faster and the running time for the concept veriìcation process increases We observed the correctness of event tags degrades when event ontology augmentation process exists fast This observation conìrms the ndings of g 7 Within each domain we compared the cpu-performance among lab and non-lab data sets We noticed that the augmentation process exits relatively faster for non-lab data sets The justiìcation for this observation is that we could obtain user-related context like facebook events and check-ins from our lab users U3 U4 but such information was missing in the case of non-lab data sets This absence of information impacts wedding data sets the most since the context information in the scenario largely includes personal information such as guest list and wedding schedule such information is not publicly available on public photo sharing websites In scenario this impact is smaller than  and larger than  the missing personal information originates from the lack of context information related to personal meetings and conference schedules In scenario data sources are mostly public only a small portion of context information comes from the user-related context such as ight information,and facebook check-ins therefore we did not nd a signiìcant change in the cpu-time between lab and non-lab data sets in the domain Users U1 U2 U3 U4 U5 U6  prec 0.65 0.58 0.39 0.53 0.74 0.61 recall 0.89 0.4 0.61 0.64 0.8 0.43 f1 0.75 0.47

task time and b the total wall clock time for Hourglass jobs against a baseline MapReduce job for the PYMK task using a 30 day xed-length sliding window Values have been normalized against the baseline The Two Pass V1 variation stores a list of dest IDs in the intermediate state as the value The Two Pass V2 variation instead stores a list of dest,count pairs therefore performing intermediate aggregation Both variations were evaluated when previous output was reused RO and when it was not reused NR For total task time in a there was not a signiìcant difference between the two variations when reusing output RO The total task time for each variation averaged about 40 of baselineês For Two Pass V2  the job which does not reuse output NR is improved over the corresponding Two Pass V1 variation It improved so much that it was almost as good as the version which reuses output RO For the wall clock time in b the Hourglass jobs consistently have a higher wall clock time than baseline The output reuse cases RO perform better than the cases that do not reuse output NR with about a 40 higher wall clock time than baseline Figure 14a presents comparisons of the total task time for the two variations against the baseline MapReduce job The Hourglass jobs consistently perform better for both variations The job that reuses output performs best showing a clear improvement over the job that does not reuse output For the second variation the performance of the two jobs is similar This implies that considering total task time alone after the intermediate data is aggregated there is only a small beneìt in reusing the previous output Figure 14b presents comparisons of the wall clock times for the two variations against the baseline MapReduce job Unlike total task time for this metric the Hourglass jobs consistently performed worse Between the two the variation that reused output performed best This is different than the results of the Weibo benchmarks where Hourglass improved both metrics for large window sizes However the difference between the Weibo and PYMK benchmarks is that the latter ran on a cluster with hundreds of machines which allowed for better parallelism In this particular case there is a tradeoff between total task time and wall clock time It is worth considering though that reducing total task time reduces load on the cluster which in turn improves cluster throughput So although there may be a tradeoff between the two metrics for this job in isolation in a multitenancy scenario jobs might complete more quickly as a result of more compute resources being made available C Page Views Benchmark At LinkedIn page views are recorded in an event stream where for each event the member ID and page that was viewed is recorded  23  F o r this benchmark we computed several metrics from this event stream over a 30 day sliding window The goal was to generate for each member over the last 30 days the total number of pages viewed the total number of days that the member visited the site and page view counts for that member across several page categories Examples of page categories include proìle company group etc Computing aggregates such as these over xedlength sliding windows is a very common task for a largescale website such as LinkedIn As the task computes a xed-length sliding window partition-preserving and partition-collapsing Hourglass jobs were used The key used was the member ID and the value was a tuple consisting of a page view count a days visited count and a map of page category counts To evaluate the performance of Hourglass a baseline MapReduce job was also created Figure 15 compares the performance of Hourglass against the baseline job As in previous examples the rst iteration of Hourglass is the most time consuming Although total task time for the rst iteration was about the same as baselineês wall clock time was twice as much For subsequent iterations however total task time and wall clock time were substantially lower than baselineês Total task time was between 2 and 4 of baselineês wall clock time was between 56 and 80 of baselineês D Cardinality Estimation Benchmark The page views data from the previous example can also be used to determine the total number of LinkedIn members who accessed the website over a span of time Although this number can be computed exactly for this benchmark we use the HyperLogLog algorithm  7  o produce an estimate With HyperLogLog one can estimate cardinality with good accuracy for very large data sets using a relatively small amount of space For example in a test we performed using a HyperLogLog implementation  9  that includes improvements to the original HyperLogLog algorithm cardinalities in the hundreds of millions were 750

job for the page views aggregation task The window length used was 30 days Several runs were performed for each iteration The minimum values of total task time and wall clock time across all runs are plotted normalized by the baseline value of each iteration Total task time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about 5 greater than baselineês within the margin of error Subsequent iterations however have total task times which are in the range of 2 and 4 of baselineês which reîects a substantial reduction in resource usage Wall clock time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about double that of baselineês a result of having to run two MapReduce jobs sequentially However subsequent iterations have wall clock times between 56 and 80 of baselineês estimated to within 0.1 accuracy using only about 700 kB of storage HyperLogLog also parallelizes well making it suitable for a sliding window  7  F o r this benchmark an implementation based on HyperLogLog was used We estimated the total number of members visiting the LinkedIn website over the last 30 days using a sliding window which advanced one day at a time Since only a single statistic was computed the key is unimportant we used a single key with value members The value used was a tuple of the form data,count  The count here is a member count The data is a union type which can be either a long value or a byte array When the type is a long it represent a single member ID and therefore the corresponding count is 1L  When the type is byte array it represents the serialized form of the HyperLogLog estimator and the count is the cardinality estimate The advantage of this design is that the same value type can be used throughout the system It can also be used to form a monoid The implementation of the mapper and accumulator is straightforward The mapper emits a tuple memberId,1L for each page view event The accumulator utilizes an instance of a HyperLogLog estimator When the accumulator receives a member ID it offers it to the estimator When it receives a byte array it deserializes an estimator instance from the bytes and merges it with the current estimator For the output it serializes the current estimator to a byte array and includes the cardinality estimate The partition-preserving job used this mapper and in addition used the accumulator for its combiner and reducer The partition-collapsing job used an identity mapper which passed the data through unchanged It also used the accumulator for its combiner and reducer Using the accumulator in the combiner greatly reduces the amount of data which has to be sent from the mapper to the reducer A basic MapReduce   Task Time  Wall Clock Time                               0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Iteration Ratio Job

minimum values of total task time and wall clock time across all runs are plotted normalized by the baseline value of each iteration Total task time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is roughly the same as baselineês within the margin of error Subsequent iterations however have total task times which are in the range of 2 and 5 of baselineês which reîects a substantial reduction in resource usage Wall clock time for the rst iteration of Hourglass is about 25 greater than that of baselineês However subsequent iterations have wall clock times between 58 and 74 of baselineês job was also created to establish a baseline for comparison It used the same mapper and accumulator implementations The HyperLogLog estimator was conìgured with a m value of 20 bits which is intended to provide an accuracy of 0.1 Figure 16 compares the performance of Hourglass against the baseline job for a 30 day sliding window computed over a period of 14 days Similar to the previous benchmark total task time is signiìcantly reduced for subsequent iterations For this benchmark it is reduced to between 2 and 5 of baselineês This reîects a signiìcant reduction in resource usage Wall clock times for subsequent iterations is reduced as well by a signiìcant amount V C ONCLUSION In this paper we presented Hourglass a framework for efìciently processing data incrementally on Hadoop by providing an easy accumulator-based interface for the programmer We evaluated the framework using several benchmarks over xed-length sliding windows for two metrics total task time representing the cluster resources used and wall clock time which is the query latency Using real-world use cases and data from LinkedIn we show that a 50Ö98 reduction in total task time and a 25Ö50 reduction in wall clock time are possible compared to baseline non-incremental implementations Hourglass is in use at LinkedIn and is freely available under the Apache 2.0 open source license R EFERENCES 1 P Bhatotia A
