Singapore ICCSllSlTA 92 An Encoding Rule of Fuzzy Associative Memories Fan Junbo Jin Fan and Shi Yan Dept of Computer Science and Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University Chengdu Sichuan 610031 P R China Abstract In this paper a new encoding 
rule of fuzzy as sociative memories FAMs with the Max-Min composition units is presented Under some con dition the proposed rule can efficiently encode multiple fuzzy pattern pairs in a single FAM and perfect association of these pairs can be achieved The correctness of the proposed rule is proved and an illustrative example is given 1 Introduction 
In recent years several models that combine the strength of neural networks and fuzzy set the ory have been developed and widely applied to prospective fields such as fuzzy reasoning pattern recognition and fuzzy control The FAM in troduced by Kosko which involves the Max-Min composition units is one of the most useful and 
important paradigms Such a FAM is charac terized by the subset recall when trained using the fuzzy Hebbian rule The inability to reliably store more than one pair is its essential drawback This leads us to seek for some algorithm to overcome this drawback Due to the nondifferen tiability of the node functions gradient descent technique fails 
to apply Authors of this paper ev er suggested an iterative learning algorithm to en code multiple pairs in a FAM which employs a so-called hill-climbing search strategy to conduct This work is partly auppcrtd by National Natural Science Foundaticn of China connection weight adjustment However the algorithni 
is still a greedy method and possibly trapped at local minima of a defined cost function although satisfactory performence of the FAM is usually achieved We propose here an alternative encoding rule that employs a suitable fuzzy logi cal-implication operation different from the fuzzy Hebbian rule The proposed rule is capable of en coding multiple pairs 
in the weight matrix of a FAM if there exists some weight matrix that properly forms the fuzzy relation between the in put and output of the pairs 2 A FAM is designed to store p-many fuzzy u nit-interval valued  pattern pairs A B   A,,B the kth 
pair is represented by the vectors Ab a:,**-,ai Bk b:,*-bi respec tively The topology of a FAM is shown in Figure 1 FAMs and Fuzzy Hebbian Rule btlV  Figure 1 The topology of a FAM 1415 0 1992 IEEE 7 


Singapore ICCSllSlTA 92 In the FAM with Max-Min composition u nits perfect association implies that the following equations should hold A~oW  k=1,2,..*,p 1 where the symbol 0 denotes the Max-Min com position operation Intuitively the weight matrix W may be found using the equation w hwk t=l P t-1  n At+Bk 2 where the symbol denotes some implication operation and  n denotes a generalized super imposition e g maxima minima etc The in termediate matrix wk is used to record the logical conditional At  Kosko adopted a fuzzy Hebbian the mini mum implication R rule pointwise to encode the kth pair At Bt  in the Wt  then superimposed the matrices wks in a single matrix W by the maximum operation In pointwise form, that is w Ow  k=l  P Rc  V a:+bt k-1  a:A b 3 k=l where the symbols  V  and  A  stand for the maximum and minimum operations respectively 9 and wiis are components of the W when an input pattern A is presented to the FAM a pattern B is recalled using the Max-Min composition bi  V ai Awi 4 i-1 From equation 4 we notice that the re called B is always a subset of the stored pattern V wlr e V wm for arbitrary input pattern A Therefore multiple pairs can not be reliably stored in the FAM An approach to overcoming the problem is that a bank of FAMs is employed each of which seperately stores only one pair But this results in consuming space of storage I 1 i-1 5 3 The Proposed Encoding Rule As usual we wish to distributively and reli ably store multiple fuzzy pattern pairs\(Atr in a single FAM such that each Bt can be perfectly recalled when each corresponding Ab is presented Instead of using the minimum implication R we associate here Bk with Ak using the implication R and we also replace the maximum superimpo sition by the minimum one as well In this way we obtain the following encoding rule P w=I\\wt t 1 P R  h At In pointwise notation that is k 1 w 1  a'zbk 1 I if a:>b p otherwise 6 P RI wi  A a'+b 7 k=l Obviously  the complexity of the proposed encoding rule is equivalent to that of the fuzzy Hebbian rule used by Kosko As we know there doesn t always exist the weight matrix of a FAM which forms the appro priate fuzzy relation for arbitrary pairs of input and output In other words these pairs have to satisfy certain condition for the purpose of perfect association  On the other hand even if there ex ists some desired weight matrix the fuzzy Heb bian rule is not guaranteed to yield the desired matrix as shown 1,2 Based on analyzing the condition for existence of desired weight matrix we show below that the proposed encoding rule can yield the desired matrix if it indeed exists Since the m units in the outut layer of the FAM are independent one another we can con sider only one output unit So the equation 1 is simply rewritten as 1416 0 1992 IEEE

Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the

apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of

question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma

These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in
