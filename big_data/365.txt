INTRODUCTION Some problems that should be solved in hyperspectral Remote Sensing information processing include rapid processing of vast information, pre-known knowledge 
acquisition, feature extraction, robust algorithm with high reliability and low sensitivity to noises, and quantitative analysis and inversion of HRS. In order to solve those problems, multi-discipline theories and techniques should be used. Among those theories and techniques, Data Mining DM\s very important. DM has developed rapidly since 1980s got wide applications in different domains. DM can discover the knowledge that is hidden behind vast data and information and serve as knowledge capture tool of expert system. Hyperspectral RS information contains many rules and knowledge that is useful to intelligent information processing. So it is necessary to investigate the theories 
methods and applications of hyperspectral RS data mining HRSDM\n order to promote hyperspectral RS information processing and its wide applications  II.  RESEARCH BACKGROUND The difference between RS Image Data Mining \(DM\d general image analysis is that the latter pays more attention on some specific patterns and characteristics and belongs to scope of pattern recognition, but the former emphasizes on discovering those rules and knowledge by analyzing all significant and meaningful patterns in image sets without any pre-known conditions. The two operations can cooperate and promote each other. General image processing and analysis techniques can be used to process those images involved in 
DM, and RS image DM can provide image processing with rules and knowledge that are important in intelligent information processing  Nowadays studies on RS Data Mining are focused on machine learning, model of DM system, typical applications and other fields. On machine learning field, D. Charlebois discussed machine learning in RS analysis and applied it to expert system; M. Schroder analyzed the interactive learning in RS image library and applied it to content-based image retrieval; M. Datcu combined RS data interpretation and image data mining based on multi-level Bayesian learning model and applied it to processing of SAR, STRM and other RS data. On RS data mining model and framework fields 
Leen-Kiat et al proposed a common model used to RS image data mining named as DIMUS Data Investigation Model for Unsupervised Segmentation that consisted of checking tools clue generator, classifier, adjustor and mapping tools. On typical applications field, Aldridge used RS-GKDD Rough Set Based Geographic Knowledge Induction approach with support of Rough Set theory to analyze the landslide images and find relationships among elevation, rock properties and landslide; LasKaris investigated DM techniques in multi-source image analysis based on Hopfield neural 
network; G. B. Smith extracted the rules describing direction relations of entities from raster mage by fuzzy data mining methods; S. McCaslin researched knowledge discovery from multi-spectral satellite images by fuzzy neural network and extracted related classification rules; Eklund extracted knowledge about soil salinity from TM image and geographical data by C4.5 algorithm; Huang extracted knowledge about wetland classification from GIS data and  752  0-7803-9050-4/05/$20.00 \2512005 IEEE 752 


SPOT images by C4.5 algorithm; and so on. All those work has given useful tests to RS image data mining and some new theories including rough set, fuzzy theory, neural network and oths have been used. Also hyperspectral RS Data Mining has got attentions from some researchers. Wang et al proposed hyperspectral data mining towards automatic classification and target identification, and G. Camps-Valls applied SVM to knowledge discovery from hyperspectral RS image. But compared with multi-spectral RS data mining, studies on hyperspectral RS data mining are rather few and more work should be done in this field  III  THE FRAMEWORK OF HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING DATA MINING A.  Framework of HRSDM Figure 1 is the framework of HRSDM. It can be known that the theories and framework of HRSDM are similar to general DM, but in specific processing strategies and methods there are obvious differences and the characteristics of HRS should be emphasized For users, the processing flow of HRSDM can be illustrated by Figure.2. Users interacts with the graphic user interface GUI\d detail mining procedure will be guided by DM engine, finally the discovered  knowledge will be return to users for further applications                       B  The discovered knowledge  It is necessary to analyze the properties of discovered knowledge and that is very important for further information processing. We categorize it into five types as follows 1  Spectral signatures of ground objects Hyperspectral RS can record spectral information of ground object with hundreds of bands by small wavelength internal, and provide spectral curves of different ground objects and pixels \(in general, albedo is used\ Much knowledge about a certain ground object such as positions of absorption or reflection bands, spectral absorption index SAI\fractal of spectral curv e, entropy, derivative spectra and others can be discovered by analyzing and processing spectral curves. After related knowledge is discovered, further assessment, reduction and representation will be used to acquire the most effective knowledge and rules that can be used to intelligent information processing 2 Spatial characteristics, rules and relationships  Hyperspectral RS images can record information about land use and land cover from both spatial and spectral dimension. So HRSDM can discover complex spatial rules and knowledge similar to SDM such as general geometric knowledge, spatial distribution rules, spatial association rules spatial aggregation rules, spatial discrimination rules and spatial evolution trends  3 Knowledge about genesis, characterization and diagnosis Hyperspectral RS data can be used to extract information about composition, component and formation of different objects, for example, genesis of mineral, indexes of vegetation, organic content in crops, morbid change in crops and so on. In fact some methods such as statistics, induction deduction and clustering all use thoughts similar to DM. By DM those rules and knowledge about genesis characterization and diagnosis can be discovered and further used to information processing. At the same time, such knowledge plays very important roles in quantitative RS  4 Relationship among bands and spectral knowledge  Correlativity exists in different bands of hyperspectral RS image, especially strong correlativity exists in those adjacent bands, and much useful knowledge hides behind that correlativity, for example, some band combinations and quantitative relationships among different bands are useful for identifying vegetation. Spectral derivative plays important roles in information processing, and some specific multi-order  Original HRS data Object data sets Preprocessing Operation data sets Data transformation and integration DM Discovered rules and patterns Knowledge and rules Explanation Assessment  Data selection Registration Filtering, enhancement Data cleaning up Auxiliary data Data checking  Data integration Data transformation Feature extraction Data reduction Conceptual leveling Data organization  Clustering Association rules Decision tree Computation intelligence N onlinear analysis Rough set theory  Pattern extraction Knowledge interpretation Knowledge assessment Knowledge expression Knowledge reasoning Knowledge management  Figure 1 Framework of HRSDS GUI DM Primitive DM Engine DM Operations Knowledge Interpretation users Figure 2  The processing flow of HRSDM  753  0-7803-9050-4/05/$20.00 \2512005 IEEE 753 


spectral derivatives can characterize and describes related objects effectively. Those spectral relationship and rules can be acquired by DM operations 5 Dynamic change or evolution knowledge  Dynamic monitoring is an important application field of hyperspectral RS information. By compared with RS information of different times or standard reference spectra the change trends can be analyzed from spatial and spectral dimension and further diagnosis and reduction to changes can be investigated. That is very important and helpful for decision-making. Temporal mining to hyperspectral RS information can be used to dynamic evolution monitoring 6 Abnormity extraction and isolated point identification  Sometimes DM is used to abnormity extraction or isolated point identification in high-dimensional space. Abnormity identification and extraction is also an important use of hyperspectral RS information. By HRSDM those abnormal patterns can be discovered and used to further analysis  C.  Some key techniques Oriented to the characteristics of hyperspectral RS information, there are some key technical problems about DM should be solved, and that are the focus of our further studies  1 Preprocessing and feature extraction  Information redundancy and vast data amount are very difficult problems in HRSDM. For hyperspectral RS information, how to do the operations such as dimensionality reduction, indexing high-dimensional data, feature extraction and organization will affect the performance DM  2 DM algorithms  Algorithms are the core of DM. Algorithms in HRSDM can be investigated from two aspects: one is to improve and develop those algorithms for general data mining, image data mining and SDM, and the other is to design new algorithms based on the characteristics of hyperspectral RS data and modern computation intelligence, nonlinear science and knowledge engineering 3 Knowledge representation, interpretation and assessment  Many rules and patterns can be discovered by HRSDM and the further key problem is how to express, assess, manage and use them, especially how to assure reliability and quality of discovered knowledge and avoid wrong knowledge  4 Integration of RS information fusion and data mining In many cases hyperspectral RS information should be collaborated and integrated with other RS information and auxiliary data, so multi-source and multi-format information and data mining is important  5 Temporal data mining  Dynamic monitoring is also important application domain of hyperspectral RS, for example, vegetation monitoring and crop growth assessment. In those tasks, multi-temporal data mining and dynamic patterns discovery are major operations and related algorithms should be investigated  6 RS image data mining engine and primitives  In order to provide users with convenient and friendly HRSDM system, it is necessary to develop effective DM engines that are composed of a series of function modules and used to realize specific DM al gorithms. Also DM primitives used to describe DM tasks are important IV. SOME USEFUL DM ALGORITHMS Based on the characteristics of hyperspectral RS information and related DM algorithms, some algorithms can be used to HRSDM include clustering, ANN, Rough set and fuzzy theory, association rules mining and decision tree. But more algorithms should be designed according to the demands of hyperspectral RS information  A. Clustering Clustering can segment vast HRS information into different sets from spectral and spatial dimension, and then the hidden rules and knowledge can be discovered by further processing That is very effective to band selection, typical signature extraction and pure pixel identification. In general clustering should be combined with other algorithms such as inductive learning, statistics and decision tree because clustering only realizes aggregation to original data and signatures of each class should be processed further in order to discover rules  B. Artificial Neural Network  ANN  ANN including BPNN, RBF, ART and Hopfield neural network are used to DM widely. For high-dimensional information, ANN has its advantages over traditional methods Nowadays ANN is used to hyperspectral RS information classification in some cases, and ANN has wide potential to HRSDM also. In the future, ANN can be used to HRSDM effectively C Rough set and Fuzzy theory Noise exists in hyperspectra l RS information because of many uncertain factors, so DM algorithms with good robustness and capability are very important. Rough set theory fuzzy theory and gray theory are useful tools for processing uncertain information, and their applications in DM have got much attention. Rough set and fuzzy theory can be used effectively in order to reduce the uncertainties in original data D. Association rules As a widely used DM approach, association rule mining can be used to HRSDM also. Some traditional algorithms such as Aprior algorithm, Sampling algorithm DIC can be used directly or by some improvements. Some new algorithms should be designed according to characteristics of hyperspectral RS information E. Decision tree Decision tree can be used to classification, typical information extraction and object identification in hyperspectral RS information, also decision tree can be used effectively in HRSDM  F. Data Ming based on data cube In general HRS image is visualized by spectra-spatial data cube, and HRSDM can be done by some operations to data cube such as rolling, probing and slicing. Especially in DM to spectral and spatial dimension, operations based on data cube  754  0-7803-9050-4/05/$20.00 \2512005 IEEE 754 


can play important roles V. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS HRSDM will play important roles in intelligent information processing and its wide and deep applications. The following are some typical and potential application domains  A. Typical information extraction and identification By DM to standard spectral database and hyperspectral RS image, the rules and knowledge that are effective to typical ground objects or entities can be discovered, so decision tree or reasoning rules can be generated and used to information extraction and identification directly B. Quantitative RS and RS inversion Hyperspectral RS information is the basis of quantitative RS and RS inversion. DM can discover rules and knowledge useful for quantitative RS and RS inversion. For example model and rules about NDVI, leaf area index \(LAI\iomass and other graphical data like elevation, slope can be established by DM and that will be used to further analysis as reference knowledge  C. Classification and mixed pixel decomposition For hyperspectral RS information, domain knowledge acquisition is the fundamental problems of intelligent processing, and HRSDM can do this work effectively. In order to improve classification precision, mixed pixel decomposition has got more and more emphasis, and DM can be used to such tasks as pure pixel identification decomposition knowledge acquisition and model selection  D. Dimensionality reduction In order to reduce data volume to be processed dimensionality reduction is commonly used in hyperspectral RS information processing, and two approaches including feature selection and feature extraction are used. DM can be used to discover those band combinations and feature sets effective to specific domain and improve processing efficiency and application performance  VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS In this paper, some primary topics on hyperspectral RS data mining are investigated oriented to the development of hyperspectral RS technology and information processing theories and trends of Spatial Data Mining and Image Data Mining. After analysis to roles and status of HRSDM, its framework and processing flow is proposed, and the types and attributes of discovered knowledge, typical mining modes and major DM algorithms are discussed. Finally some potential application domains are proposed. HRSDM has significant potential applications and will play important roles in HRS applications, so it is necessary to give more comprehensive studies on this topic. In the future, our work will be focused on design of detail DM algorithms, development of DM system and typical application of HRSDM ACKNOWLEDGMENT This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No.40401038\ the Scientific Foundation of CUMT \(No.D200403\d Opening Foundation of Key Lab of Fundamental Geographical Information and Digitalization Techniques in Shandong Province, China \(No. 2003-03  Reference 1   Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and translated by Fan Ming and Meng Xiaofeng.

This is a simple example to show how the proposed algorithm can be used to mine membership functions and fuzzy association rules from quantitative data Assume there are four items in a transaction database: milk bread cookies and beverage. The data set includes the six transactions shown in Table 1 Figure 7 The final set of membership functions 120 


After the membership functions are derived the fwzymining method proposed in 5 is then used to mine fuzzy association rules from the quantitative database 7 Conclusion and future works In this paper we have proposed a GA-based fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions Since the fitness of each set of membership functions is evaluated by the fuzzy supports of the linguistic terms in the large I-itemsets and the suitability of the derived membership functions the derivation process can easily be done by the divide-and-conquer strategy Our approach can reduce human experts\222 intervention during the mining process thus saving much acquisition time In the future we will continuously attempt to enhance the GA-based mining framework for more complex problems Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their very constructive comments This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under contract NSC92-22 13-E-390-001 References l R Agrawal and R Srikant, \223Fast algorithm for mining association rules,\224 The International Conference on Very Large Databases 1994 pp 487-499 0 Cordbn F Herrera and P Villar, \223Generating the knowledge base of a fuzzy rule-based system by the 2 31 genetic learning of the data base,\224 IEEE Transactions on Fuzv Systems Vol 9 No 4,2001 F Herrera M Lozano and J L Verdegay 223Fuzzy connectives based crossover operators to model genetic algorithms population diversity,\224 Fuzzy Sets andSysfems Vol. 92 No 1 pp 21-30 1997 T P Hong C S Kuo and S C Chi 223Mining association rules from quantitative data\224 Intelligent Data Analysis Vol 3 No 5 1999 pp 363-376 T P Hong C S Kuo and S C Chi 223Trade-off between time complexity and number of rules for fuzzy mining from quantitative data,\224 International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge based Systems Vol 9 No 5,2001 pp 587-604 M Kaya, and R Alhajj 223A clustering algorithm with genetically optimized membership functions for fuzzy association rules mining,\224 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2003 pp 881 886 R Srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables,\224 The 1996 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Monreal, Canada, June 1996 pp 1-12 C H Wang T P Hong and S S Tseng, \223Integrating fuzzy knowledge by genetic algorithms,\224 ZEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Vol 2 C H Wang, T P Hong and S S Tseng, \223Integrating membership functions and fuzzy rule sets from multiple knowledge sources,\222\222 Fuzzy Sets and Sysfems W Wang and S M Bridges 223Genetic algorithm optimization of membership functions for mining fuzzy association rules,\224 The International Joint Conference on Information Systems Fuzzy Theory and Technology, 2000 pp 13 1-1 34 NO.4 pp 138-149 1998 Vol 112 pp 141-154,2000 121 


some are best for dense type datasets Currently there is no single algorithm exist that shows global best performance on all types of datasets The main limitation of previous algorithms is that they really upon only single strategy and do no combine the best features of multiple strategies for speedup the process of itemset mining In this paper we show that combining the best features of multiple strategies into a single hybrid is more beneficial and efficient than relying upon single strategy Our different experimental results on benchmark datasets show that mining all and maximal frequent itemsets using our hybrid approach is more efficient than existing algorithms and gives global best performance 13 T Uno M Kiyomi H Arimura LCM ver 3 Collaboration of Array Bitmap and Prefix Tree for Frequent Itemset Mining In 1st Int'l Workshop on Open Source Data Mining in conjunction with SIGKDD2005 2005 14 M J Zaki and C Hsiao Charm An efficient algorithm for closed association rule mining In Technical Report 99-10 Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1999 8 References 1 R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc ACMSIGMOD Int'l Conf Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc Int'l Conf Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 Sept 1994 3 S Bashir A Rauf Baig HybridMiner Mining Maximal Frequent Itemsets using Hybrid Database Representation Appraoch In Proc of 10th IEEE-INMIC conference Karachi Pakistan 2005 4 D Burdick M Calimlim and J Gehrke Mafia A maximal frequent itemset algorithm for transactional databases In Proc ofICDE Conf pp 443-452 2001 5 Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations B Goethals and M.J Zaki eds CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 http:HCEURWS.org/Vol-90 6 K Gouda and M J Zaki Efficiently mining maximal frequent itemsets In ICDM pp 163-170 2001 7 G Grahne and J Zhu Efficiently Using Prefix-trees in Mining Frequent Itemsets In Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2003 8 J Han J Pei and Y Yin Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation In SIGMOD pages 1-12 2000 9 J Liu Y Pan K Wang and J Han Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection In Proc of KDD Conf 2002 10 G Liu H Lu Y Xu and J X Yu Ascending frequency ordered prefix-tree Efficient mining of frequent patterns In DASFAA 2003 11 J Pei J Han H Lu S Nishio S Tang and D Yang HMine Hyper-structure mining of frequent patterns in large databases In Proc of ICDMConf pp 441.448 2001 12 A Pietracaprina and D Zandolin Mining Frequent Itemsets Using Patricia Tries Proc IEEE ICDM Workshop Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations CEUR Workshop Proc vol 80 Nov 2003 243 


The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels. Note that the manager\222s method 223browse\224 cannot read the worker\222s \223work_hour\224 and \223hour_pay\224. The rationale is described in the last paragraph of section 4.4 Requirement 3 If a worker is not assigned to a manager, the manager can only read the worker\222s general information This requirement is accomplished by the method 223browse\224 of the object \223manager\224 and the labels with the association \223not_assigned\224. To get the general information of a worker not assigned to a manager, the method \223browse\224 invokes the worker\222s method \223get_self_general_info\224 using the manager\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. The statement \223g_info self_general_info;\224 within the worker\222s method 223get_self_general_info\224 can be executed after comparing labels Requirement 4 If a worker and a manager are friends, they can read each other\222s general information This requirement is achieved by the labels with the association \223friend\224. For example, a worker can read his manager friend\222s general information through the worker\222s method 223get_others_general_info\224, which invokes the manager\222s \223get_self_general_info\224 using the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 as an argument. After comparing the label of the worker\222s attribute \223others_general_info\224 and the manager\222s attribute \223self_general_info\224, one can see that the secure flow condition is true. The statement \223g_info := self_general_info;\224 within the manager\222s method \223get_self_general_info;\224 can be executed Requirement 5 Periodically, the company invokes foreign objects to compute the salaries and taxes of workers This requirement is fulfilled by the stubs \223stub1\224 and stub2\224 in Example 1. Please refer to the description in section 4.3. Moreover, the three rules mentioned in section 3.2 prevent the foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses  7. Evaluation  We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. The system uses reusable software repository to simulate foreign object control. Moreover, it uses the language shown in Example 1 to write programs A program written in the language is first pre-processed to produce a program without labels and MLs. The program produced by the preprocessor is conceptually composed of two parts. One is the program before labeling and the other a security monitor The latter checks information flows of the former using Algorithm 1 during program execution Currently, the security monitor checks security dynamically, which contradicts the proposal of static checking [1, 12, 24  N e ve r t he l e ss d yna mi c c he c ki n g  cannot be totally avoided because objects and AGs may be dynamically instantiated or removed during program execution To evaluate the model, we used the example described in section 2 as an assignment to students of different grades and experiences. The students are required to develop a program, namely program a  without the proposed model embedded and another program, namely program b with the model embedded. We then collected and averaged the following metrics data: 1\ LOC \(lines of code\f programs a and b, 2\ecution time of programs a and b, and 3\numbers of non-secure statements found in program b. The collected data showed that the averaged LOC and execution time of program b are respectively 3.2 and 3.8 times those of program a Nevertheless, the data also showed that 2.3 non-secure information flows \(per 100 LOC\n average are identified from program b. Although the runtime overhead seems high, we still think that the model is valuable because of the ability to identify non-secure statements. Nevertheless, reducing the overhead should be an important future work  8. Related work  The simplest information flow control approach is DAC. Since DAC fails to avoid Trojan horses, the multilevel security approach was proposed [6-9  The approach is generally categorized as MAC MAC was criticized as too restricted [5 T o lo o s en  the restriction, quite a few approaches have been proposed. Below we survey some researches The model proposed in t rol s t h e  information flows in object-oriented systems. It uses ACL of objects to compute the ACL of executions. A message filter is used to filter out possibly non-secure information flows. Since the computation of an execution\222s ACL takes information propagation into consideration, no Trojan horses will result Moreover, interactions among executions are categorized into five modes including synchronized unrestricted, synchronous restricted, asynchronous deferred reply unrestricted, and deferred reply restricted. Different modes result in different ACLs Proceedings of t he 36th Ha waii International Conf erence on S y st e m Sciences \(HICSS\22203 0 76 95 18 745/0 3 1 7.00 251 20 02  I E EE 


which loosens the restriction of MAC. More flexibility is added to the model by allowing exceptions during or after method execution [10-11 The purpose-oriented model [21-22 pro pos es  that invoking a method may be allowed for some methods but disallowed for other methods, even when the invokers belong to the same object. This consideration is correct, because the security levels of methods in an object may be different Different methods can thus access information in different security levels The decentralized label approach [1-4 m a rk s t h e  security levels of variables using labels. A label is composed of one or more policies, which should be simultaneously obeyed. A policy in a label is composed of an owner and zero or more readers that are allowed to access the data. When computation are applied to data, join operation is used to compute the label of the result data. This avoids Trojan horses Another feature proposed by this approach is that declassification \(downgrading of security level provided. This allows non-sensitive data, which are in high security level, to be accessed by low security level processes. The model also takes write access control into consideration [4 rren t l y t h e m o d e l  has been used to develop a programming language Jflow [1 ad d itio n   th e m o d e l h a s b e e n  u s ed i n a  distributed system with untrusted hosts through secure program partitioning [30  Role-based access control models [19, 27, 33  define the roles a subject can play. A role is a collection of permissions \(i.e., access rights  When a subject plays a role, it possesses the rights belonging to the role. A subject can play multiple roles and even change role during a session Inheritance and other relationships can be established among roles [27 t o s t ru ct u re t h e m Moreov er  constraints, such as two specific roles should be mutually exclusive, can be attached to roles. The advantage of role-based access control is that subjects can change roles dynamically, which facilitates obeying the \223need-to-know\224 principle. It seems that the role-based models operate well in an application that protects not too many resources because roles should be defined before the application\222s execution. In case that many resources should be protected \(such as every variable in a program should be protected\ining roles becomes tedious and the access control may become imprecise From the survey, we identified many necessary features for controlling information flows in object-oriented systems such as Trojan horse prevention, declassification, purpose-oriented method invocation, and so on. In fact, our model offers those features, although we do not present them in this paper. What we present in this paper are the control of information flows among objects and foreign objects. According to our survey, no model offers the control well  9. Conclusions  This paper proposes a model to control information flows among objects. The model uses associations and method limitations \(ML\ to control information flows among objects. Information flows are controlled by attaching labels to variables. Trojan horses are avoided by join operations. Within an application, every variable and literal is associated with one or more labels. If a variable is associated with multiple labels, each label enforces the security policy of an association. To check the security of an information flow, labels are compared. An information flow is secure if the comparison causes the secure flow condition true In addition to controlling objects developed by programmers, the model also controls foreign objects which are pre-existing objects for reused. Since the details of a foreign object are unknown, our model only prevents foreign objects from becoming Trojan horses. We use the \223Suppression rule\224, \223No ML rule\224 and \223Stuck to rules\224 to control foreign objects We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the model. From the data collected, we found that the model does facilitate identifying non-secure information flows. We thus believe that the model is useful in spite of runtime overhead  Acknowledgement  This research is sponsored by the National Science Council in Taiwan under Grant NSC91-2213-E-259-006  References  1  A  C.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
