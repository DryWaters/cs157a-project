ABSTRACT 
Network security assessment is decisively based on the protection security Dispersed generation is increasing in distribution networks This development is affecting the protection behaviour adversely Maloperation of protection relays becomes likely Thus methods of protection security assessment are necessary to cope with the new network conditions of distributed generation and all their impacts This paper is presenting such a methodology using fully software assisted procedures A systematic protection security assessment 
of variants of network and protection configurations is feasible with a restricted operating expense For the evaluation and illustration of the big amount of output data an appropriate graphical approach will be shown 
INTRODUCTION Distribution networks are subjected to a drastic change due to an increasing penetration with dispersed generation DG  DG-infeeds can be located nearly everywhere in the network depending on the availability of regenerative energy sources The conventional top down network structure is practically turned upside down A wide diversification and variety of infeeding characteristics 
regarding loading and short-circuit behavior unconventional network structures and conditions like T\255 line connections and the partly abdication of n-1 safety must be expected and handled by the Distribution System Operators DSO In general the network security is highly endangered by this development The protection security is an essential subitem of the network security and an important aspect preventing large system contingencies The protection system of distribution networks comprises commonly protection devices of a lower functionality and intelligence as in transmission systems Functions like fuses overcurrent and plain distance relays are applied Differential protection can be quite rarely expected Thus the protection response is strongly dependent on the network behavior In the past the 
co-ordination between the network and the protection system is developed operatively and is mostly not considering the increasing DG infeeds Thus the protection co-ordination concept must be revised and updated in the whole network An appropriate protection security assessment methodology is necessary to investigate bottlenecks of the protection system systematically and ensures network security under changed network conditions METHOD OF INVESTIGATION The proposed method of investigation needs different steps These are illustrated in Figure 1 The study begins with performing a network and protection data base by data collecting and data structuring work followed up by data plausibility checks The contingency simulation is based on a network model including the DG-infeeds and the 
necessary protection functionality which is provided by PSS\256SINCAL as a whole o System improvement Fig 1 Flow chart of the steps of the investigation The evaluation is assisted by graphical charts of the output data enabling an assessment at a glance This is basis of a systematic enhancement of the network behavior under contingency conditions Data Collection The data collection comprises data of primary and secondary equipment Whereas the primary data collection is state of the art the secondary data collection is a rather 
new challenge caused by its high number of devices and the high variety of types and manufacturer specific performances Thus at the beginning a proper data structuring based on physical relay models is an indispensable step of this task In the protection data base all necessary details about the settings and the technical data of protection devices are collected Each relay is assigned to one element line transformer shunt reactor etc and has his individual parameters such as current orland voltage transformer ratio type of tripping characteristic time delay release current etc Furthermore in each file it is possible to work with different setting groups It enables the simulation and 
comparison of varied setting configurations Plausibility check Because of the big amount of data and to make the results of the study reasonable a software assisted data plausibility check is necessary With use of logic routines e.g the settings of relays can be checked Different levels of data checking are applied as the physical range check the

covers between 10 and 100 of the cable length caused by operational reasons comparison with common setting strategies as well as the relay type requirements and the crossover check with other devices  During this procedure obviousl y wrong settings can be detected  reported and corrected  In addition missing data are retrieved and can be completed  The quality of these data checking routines is mainly determining the quality and reliability of the study results Thus this step should be carried out by high diligence  Contingency simulation In advance of the contingency simulation  the contingency scenarios of the network to be studied must be defined  These are dependent of the operation methods and operational scenarios of the network which must be discussed in close cooperation with the DSO The contingency scenarios  that means e.g which lines or transformers can be switched off or can be overloaded unexpected must also be found with the DSO The use of automatic batch routines of the simulation software makes it possible to simulate different contingency scenarios without making any time-consuming manual changes in the data base of the simulation software  An appropriate method of the contingency simulation is the so called running fault method  Here the behavior of protection system is routinely tested by the variation of fault locations through the entire network Faults will be done on each line of the network e.g in steps of 2 of the corresponding line length  In this way the fault is running effectively through the whole network The simulation system calculates the response of all protection devices on each fault done in the network The running fault method will be applied to different contingency scenarios Evaluation of results The applied methods of contingency simulation are producing a big amount of output data To use the whole information content of these data appropriate evaluation methods are essential Firstly the results will be previewed and reorganized by macro technique  This leads to a limitation and separation of relevant and irrelevant information  The human perception is mostly capable of processing graphical prepared data That is why beside a pure software assisted evaluation of the correctness of the protection responses a graphical illustration has been developed to provide the whole relevant information to the operator at a glance Evaluation criteria can be e.g fault tripping at all selective tripping tripping in the first zone tripping below a certain time limit etc This is depending on the requirements of the operator System improvement The previous evaluation step shows clearly the bottlenecks of the protection system applied to the network with DG\255 infeeds The protection settings or protection functions can be adapted systematically achieving an improvement of the protection system behavior  The advancement as well as the worsening of such measures can be verified by re

 5 changes to the technical ba seline, and communicating the approved changes in subsequent revisions of the document Focusing on the key areas of a technical baseline, the technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests are the areas that should be continuously evaluated for quantifiable changes.  If these areas are monitored and changes controlled and communicated through a formal process the technical baselin e becomes the authoritative source for technical data on th e project and an excellent measure of the progress and changes at the end of the project 5  I NFORMATION T ECHNOLOGY P ROJECT T ECHNICAL B ASELINE I MPLEMENTATION  The Information Technology \(IT\ where the technical baseline concept was implemented was the Unified Messaging System \(UMS\S is an IT project that transitioned all 7,000 JPL electronic mail client users from the Eudora mail client to Microsoft Outlook Exchange. When I joined the project it was already underway and had been operating with a high-level project management plan that included a schedule and deliverables Roles and responsibilities, tec hnical parameters, risks and mitigations and test protocols had not been defined.  Most of these items were recognized as activities that would take place at some point in the pr oject but were not documented or planned.  Figure 2 below is a sample diagram from the JPL UMS Communication Plan.  It is a diagram of the JPL UMS system and with the exception of some software builds and version documentation was the most technical part of the documentation.  Needless to say there were many other more technical parameters, activities, and tests that needed to be documented and communicated to the team  Figure 2: JPL Unified Messaging System Diagram IT Projects have similarities with large-scale engineering projects such as space systems because of their technical nature, large stakeholder base, and need for test and redundancy.  Unfortunately IT projects are managed like an average work project and the t echnical parameters that are so important to all of the st akeholders are treated as an afterthought.  The UMS project was no exception after the first five months of operation.  We immediately recognized that the project was struggling mostly with stakeholder communication, an authoritativ e source for technical data and a test plan to avoid rework and mitigate risks By implementing the technical baseline concept we had used so often on space programs and other large scale engineering projects our team was able to bring discipline back to the project in a few ke y areas that helped bring the whole project around and heading in the right direction Some of the most positive results from the technical baseline documentation were ar eas where discipline in the approach and execution were critical to success and controlling scope creep and rework.   The top three areas with positive results are listed here and described further in this section  Stakeholder Communication  Authoritative Source for Technical Data  Test Plan  Five months into the project communication between stakeholders had broken down in some critical areas such as implementation and training and was non-existent in other areas such as test planning.  Exacerbating the communication issue was the lack of an authoritative source for Technical Data for the stake holders to use.  As a result when communication did occur and decisions were made there was no mechanism to eith er reference the baseline to ensure scope compliance or make note of the revision to the baseline and documentation of any impacts to the scope change.  The test plan was another critical area that had difficulty gaining momentum until a technical baseline was implemented and the team had a common set of parameters to plan for in their test system and test scenario preparation If these three areas had not had a common baseline for the project to work from, to document revisions, and to use for communication the project would have continued to drift and been at major risk of extreme cost and schedule growth  Stakeholder Communication One of the most important lessons learned from the benefit of implementing a technical baseline on the UMS project was using it as a communication vehicle within the project team and to project stake holders.  Once the system characteristics, key design factors risks, and test plans were documented in one baseline all of the stakeholders had a place to go first to answer ques tions or take issue with a parameter.  The technical team had a place to document their plans and changes through the revision control process where everyone else on the t echnical team could see the changes and use it as an authoritative source.  The clients could use the technical base line to communicate concerns desired changes, or insight into risk mitigation or changes 
 


 6 The users and other stakeholders were able to use the technical baseline to communi cate concerns or parameter changes they needed so the sy stem was interoperable with other systems.  In the end this was probably the single greatest benefit of the technical baseline documentation \226 an authoritative document providing all of the technical, risk and test parameters in one place to facilitate communication among all stakeholders Authoritative Source for Technical Data As mentioned previously, the importance of an authoritative source for technical data cannot be underestimated Unfortunately too often on IT projects, the IT parameters risk assessment and mitigations, and test strategies remain in the hands, heads, or hard drives of the technicians.  When these individuals come together to document and agree on the technical parameters for the system it helps everyone.  A common technical baseline provides the framework for this collaboration and documentation to take place.  It also allows the team and the clients to look at the technical information differently and translate the big picture into other consequences, mitigate risks, understand cost and schedule impacts, and plan for testing. Most importantly having a set baseline allows control of requirements and scope changes and a mechanism for comparison after project completion.  Rather than an ever changing and drifting IT system where victory would eventually be declared and the system operational, we now had a set baseline for decision making and project metrics.  When a change was considered it could be measured in relation to the requirements, impact, risk, cost and schedule and appropriate action could be taken and a revision to the baseline documented.  Changes that were deemed out of scope could be documented a nd prioritized for another phase of the project, allowing focus to resume on the critical path to completion Until we joined the team five months into the UMS implementation process there was no common source where the technical team could r ecord their information requirements and scope changes and associated impacts Once the framework was created for the technical baseline interviews were conducted to populate the data, and communication sessions were conducted to ensure everyone understood the document, it became useful. Knowing that the data was accurate and that the technical team was relying on the data to communi cate with each other, develop interoperable systems, and plan for future tests, the technical baseline became an authoritative source for UMS data for the team and the client Test Plan Once the project team had a complete set of technical parameters, a technical baseline document to use to communicate with clients, and an area where risks were identified, test became the next focus.  A solid test plan is critical to ensuring timely IT project implementation and acceptance.  A system that has not been properly tested can still be implemented but risk will undermine client confidence and implementation delays if issues surface later The technical baseline allowed the UMS team to articulate the UMS test plans, schedules, and requirements and communicate them to all users In addition the test team was also able to take into account potential risk areas where mitigation options should be identified and tested as alternatives.  The UMS program went from a \223test when it\222s done\224 plan to a detailed and incr emental test plan that was responsive to the client concerns as they were raised or as issues were uncovered The UMS technical baseline allowed the entire team and stakeholders to have an open book on the UMS technical parameters and implementation plan in a way that was more effective than the average project plan.  The simple technical tables of authoritative data generated discussion questions, and ultimately a bette r product.  The discussions generated improved communication with the client and helped to manage expectations for final delivery.  In the end all of the things that project managers think comes naturally on a project team were brought together in an effective and fact based way through the technical baseline to achieve solid results for the UMS program 6  P ROCESS I MPROVEMENT P ROJECT L ESSONS L EARNED  The JPL Acquisition Process Improvement program was even less technical than the JPL UMS implementation.  The basis for the process improvement is Lean Six Sigma and the intent is to improve processes in the Acquisition Division on non-engineering initiativ es at JPL.  Other than statistics from metrics or surveys there was little data resulting in anything resembling technical information on this project The advantage was being able to implement the technical baseline on this project from the start.  While much of the project was not technical, there was still a Project Charter for the overall Acquisition Process Improvement Lean Six Sigma Implementation, and a project plan that included a schedule, selected LSS projects, and the original project Statement of work.  From these supporting documents a technical baseline for the overall project that included technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests was created.  Technical Parameters in this case were adjusted to be program objec tives and success metrics for the overall program.  Operational concepts were important to document in the case of the API LSS program as much of the programs success focused on change management during the implementation phase of the LSS initiative.  Risk is not often documented in the context of a LSS program Risks to the API LSS program were documented in the 
 


 7 technical baseline which has proven useful as a proactive management and communication tool for risk management Test is another unusual area for a LSS program to evaluate and baseline.  In this case test became protocol and metrics for stakeholder communication, change management, and limited tests for LSS implementations.  These adjustments from a traditional technical baseline to the API LSS technical baseline were usef ul for the project team communication and for revision tracking back to the baseline to measure program progress and success Given this project construct the technical baseline was documented in a MS Power Point document.  The document is shown in Figure 3 below  Figure 3: API LSS Project Technical Baseline Working with process improvement experts and Lean Six Sigma Black Belts, the projects are always well organized and often well communicated.  So how did the practices from a technical baseline help the project?  The technical baseline concepts were introduced to provide more detail to the project plan and help as a communication vehicle to API stakeholders Unlike a traditional project plan the technical baseline was a companion document that provided an additional level of detail with the project implementation plans, the critical success factors, metrics that would be measured, potential risks, and any early test cases for the process improvement and their results.  This information was available to all stakeholders and project leads which provided an authoritative source of measurable data that went beyond the project schedule.  This allowed the stakeholders to participate at a deeper level and provide comments at early and critical points in the proj ect lifecycle.  The technical baseline also became a communication vehicle for the project team to communicate progress, results and changes to their stakeholders which was important in light of the many mini-projects taking place concurrently on a LSS program.  This baseline allows for overall program tracking and adjustments rather than only focusing on individual initiatives which has become continuous source of lessons learned feedback to improve future projects under the API LSS project 7  C ONCLUSIONS  The technical baseline approach provided a team unfamiliar with large scale engineer ing projects with a common baseline for their projects.  For both UMS and API the participants gained a solid vehicle that improved communication, became an authoritative source for technical information, and allowed for risk mitigation and test planning R EFERENCES    2232004 NASA C o st Est i m at i ng Handbook \(C EH  www.ceh.nasa.gov  223NPR 7120.5 NASA Space Flight Program and Project  Management Requirements\224   M e m o randum  Owen E.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT. As Debabroto et al. \(2002 assimilation of IT could be regarded as a cumulative result of actions by individuals and units within the 


result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
