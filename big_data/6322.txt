ni@cse.ust.hk Abstract Sensing data from mobile phones provide us exciting and proìtable applications Recent research focuses on sensing indoor environment but suffers from inaccuracy because of the limited reachability of human traces or requires human intervention to perform sophisticated tasks In this paper we present ShopProìler a shop proìling system on crowdsourcing data First we extract customer movement patterns from traces Second we improve accuracy of building oor plan by adopting a gradient-based approach and then localize shops through WiFi heat map Third we categorize shops by designing an SVM classiìer in shop space to support multi-label classiìcation Finally we infer brand name from SSID by applying string similarity measurement Based on over ve thousand traces in three big malls in two different countries we conclude that ShopProìler achieves better accuracy in building reìned oor plan and characterizes shops in terms of location category and name with little human intervention I I NTRODUCTION Thanks to the widespread proliferation of mobile phones and their capability of recording processing and transmitting image audio and location data we are offered new opportunity to sense urban environment and human daily behaviors   Data from these mobile phones impact the foundation of exciting applications and proìtable commercial activities such as shopping advertising and dining Examples of applications include CSP SurroundSense 2 CrowdInside and W alkie-Markie 19 Urban sensing is usually targeting sensors at proìling places In the previous work CrowdInside system w a s proposed to automatically construct an indoor map based on smartphone Walkie-Markie constructed pathw ay by leveraging WiFi-landmark CSP cate gorized places through opportunistically collecting images and audio clips crowdsourced from smartphone users However all the previous work have several limitations when applied to real practice First traditional approaches of constructing oor plan employ sensor readings to track people and then detect room boundary by applying density-based algorithm on traces Such methods may suffer from the divergence of real layout counters shelves or other obstacles Second if utilizing audio or image assistance in categorizing places such approaches lack of scalability in terms of data sources computational complexity and privacy constraints e.g taking photo is strictly prohibited in many commercial places 978-1-4799-3360-0/14/$31.00 c  2014 IEEE The goal of our work is to proìle shops in mall by leveraging sensor readings from mobile devices as illustrated in Figure 1 Towards this goal we empirically answer four questions First how to characterize movement patterns from crowdsourcing data In daily life people follow certain movement patterns For example people may go to work in the morning take lunch at noon and go home at night Similarly we explore customer movement patterns from sensor readings in mall We collect sensing data from a variety of sources such as accelerometer compass microphone and WiFi Several interesting observations from empirical sensor readings can be used to characterize movement patterns We are able to track peopleês moving speed from sensor readings We notice that customers move at higher speed in corridor than in shop Moreover shops such as restaurant and cafe have higher population density at lunch and dinner time Second how to differentiate basic units from movement patterns Basic units in shopping malls are shops and corridors In order to proìle shops we rst differentiate basic units and then differentiate shop from each other by detecting shop boundary For differentiating basic units we extract useful features from customer movement pattern with location information and observe that movement pattern exhibits difference in different places To differentiate shops we leverage RSS Received Signal Strength information to design a boundary detection algorithm Third how to categorize shops from multiple features In a typical shopping mall shops usually fall into some basic categories such as restaurant book store electronic store supermarket fashion related etc In shop type classiìcation we investigate the sensing data and extract several useful features for building classiìer Such as walking speed population density at different times and the background sound intensity Based on these features we utilize Support Vector Machine SVM to categorize shops Finally how to proìle shops from SSID information From our eld study we have an interesting observation that SSID Service Set Identiìer can be considered as an indicator to infer shop names We have investigated several typical shopping malls and noticed First APs are pervasive and nearly all shops in malls provide WiFi service either for customers or for their own employees Second SSID of these APs are more IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications

            Fig 3 ShopProìler system descriptions of a building layout and shop information As shown in Figure 3 ShopProìler system has four modules 1 Collecting sensor data  Sensor data are collected from inertial sensors microphones and WiFi module while people walking around in shopping malls Inertial sensors including accelerometer and gyroscope provide sufìcient information for tracking customers In addition acoustic information reîects environmental features Moreover WiFi module captures data from all available APs including RSS SSID and BSSID 2 Capturing movement pattern  Customer traces in mall reveal features of what kind of shops the customers visit how long they stay and how fast they are walking On the other hand from shopês point of views traces show that how many people visit the shops in a particular time period and what is the layout inside shops 3 Differentiating basic units  We rst differentiate shop and corridor which are the two element units in typical malls ShopProìler extracts unique features from movement patterns to differentiate these basic units Then we propose a novel gradient-based room boundary detection algorithm that reduces false positive rate by traditionally applying density-based algorithm 4 Categorizing shops and discovering brand names  ShopProìler adopts SVM to categorize shops i.e restaurant electronic store book store etc This module is based on the data collected in module 1 and analysis of movement patterns in module 2 Furthermore ShopProìler performs AP localization algorithm via crowdsourcing and matches AP to oor outline Finally we label shop brand name using SSID mining Steps Fig 4 We can count steps from acceleration data One step is deìned by two wave peaks In this paper we do not include details of how to track people because mobile based indoor localization has already been extensively studied   III M OVEMENT P ATTERN IN S HOPPING M ALL To collect mobile sensing data we develop an Android App to record inertial sensor readings and background sound intensity Moreover mobile phone continuously scans all available nearby WiFi and records RSS SSID and BSSID To investigate movement pattern we conducted three experiments in three big shopping malls in two different countries In one experiment we collected over 5,000 human traces in a shopping mall for two days In the other two experiments we had 20 volunteers in each shopping mall and collected data for one whole week Several interesting observations from the eld study and real life data are reported as follows First walking speed is able to indicate location features Refer to our system design the data from inertial sensor describe people movement pattern from several aspects From the experimental results we notice that when huge amount of data traces are available walking speed can indicate a shop or a corridor Theoretically the walking speed can be calculated by integrating acceleration with respect to time However due to noise in poorly calibrated sensing data calculating speed from inertial sensor readings leads to signiìcant accumulation of errors As a result we measure w alking speed as the number of steps per minute We count steps from acceleration patterns as shown in Figure 4 Second customers frequently change walking direction and the time spent in different shops For example in a typical restaurant customers are likely to spend more time sitting at table for lunch/dinner and the heading change frequency is low On the other hand people in other shops have high frequency Third population distribution reîects patterns at different time from a shopês point of view Our observation meets the intuition that population distribution reveals a pattern type in a restaurant since the majority of people have lunch at noon and dinner at night In Figure 5 we show the table occupancy of a restaurant in a shopping mall on Monday Wednesday and Saturday respectively Population density is much higher at noon/night than other times Moreover supermarkets appear another movement pattern where most of customers leave shopping malls or go home after shopping We summarize preliminary observations from our empirical studies in Table I and list important notions in Table II IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1242

with isothermal curve We locate AP in room level by matching the hot spots with shops area into cells and for each cell we measure RSS from the AP Based on site survey we built a WiFi heat map as shown in Figure 9 a Such a WiFi heat map is constructed by site survey In practice with the help of crowdsourcing we are able to obtain a huge amount of traces Therefore the site survey procedure is conducted by implicit crowdsourcing Customers walk around with recording RSS and then we build a WiFi heat map accordingly The experimental result shows that wall affects WiFi signal as well We survey the site by measuring RSS and build heat map according to SSID and then consider the hot spot as the location of the AP Hot spot is deìned as a region within a certain isothermal curve as shown in Figure 9 b Assume the i th customer measures RSS  i at point  x i y i  in a oor plan For each shop  we have a vector that contains RSS measurement   x i y j  in the customer traces When a new customer enters the shop the corresponding RSS is added to the vector Therefore we build a heat map at time t c with all available RSS measurements   t  t  t c   ShopProìler then draws an isothermal curve and locates the hot spot in a particular shop VII E MPIRICAL E XPERIMENT R ESULT AND D ISCUSSION A Experiment Setup We conduct extensive experiments on three real life datasets from three different

functions Quadratic kernel presented the highest prediction accuracy based on the training data Since the issue of how to choose the kernel function is out of the scope of this paper ShopProìler simply chooses Quadratic kernel function in categorizing shops C Prediction in Different Scenarios We compare three prediction results on traces from three different experiment scenarios As shown in Figure 10 ShopProìler is tolerant to different trace sizes The results show that 1 the more traces the better accuracy A is better than B and C and 2 the larger room unit size the better accuracy B is better than C Note that overall the prediction accuracy begins to converge with more traces D System Performance We evaluate ShopProìler performance in two malls B  C First we compare gradient-based

ground truth of the number of shops for each shop equals one Suppose within a shop the output of density-based algorithm is two clusters which means density-based algorithm regards the two clusters as belonging to two different shops In shopping mall B the proposed gradient-based algorithm outperforms density-based algorithm There are only one FP occur On the contrary FP of density-based algorithm is three In shopping mall C the FP of the gradient-based algorithm and densitybased algorithm are the same We report prediction result on shop brand name and category in Table V There are 15 different

can investigate the accuracy during site visiting Customers can help correct the possible wrong types by voting a shop into a different classiìcation depending on site survey VIII R ELATED W ORK

robot 22 which is equipped with sensors ultrasonic or cameras to build maps In F ootSLAM used shoe-mounted inertial sensors to construct the map In PlaceSLAM deri v e d a Bayesian formulation and particle ltering implementation for manually annotated Recently researchers begin to use commodity mobile phones to construct a oor plan or path way CrowdInside  used sensor readings from mobile phones to track people by leveraging common environment anchor points to reset the errors obtained by dead-reckoning And then CrowdInside applied density-based algorithm to users traces to perform boundary detection In instead of looking at the f ace RSS values the authors leveraged the trend of RSS changes by deìning WiFi-marks and used it on building path way Our approach is different from the previous methods in room boundary detection In stead of using density-based algorithm ShopProìler leveraging RSS information to detect boundary with high accuracy since previous density-based algorithm regards the area that traces cannot be reached as wall such as shelves counters and other obstacles Characterizing places Techniques for characterizing places have been proposed from different perspectives proposed opportunistic feature vector merging and the social network-driven sharing of training data and models between users aimed to use information on the sequence of visiting each product zone to nd how they affected purchasing But our approach is from another perspective that we use mobile sensing data to proìle shops In  data from personally carried devices were augmented with users either providing or conìrming location semantics Techniques were proposed in  to le v erage F ourSquare check-in data to determine place categories But the previous approaches more or less need human to participate in Our approach is different from the previous techniques by automatically characterizing shops with little human intervention Furthermore on learning the name of location previous work mainly infer from traces data and GPS information proposed the relational Mark o v netw ork to label locations with the activities that have occurred in these places proposed a Hierarchical Hidden Mark o v Model on raw GPS data to extract signiìcant locations and mode transfer locations and then to learn users transportation routines proposed an approach that combines location and traces with sensor hints through opportunistically captured images and IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1247 


audio clips from smartphones In indoor scenarios however concrete wall prevents GPS signal being received and taking photo is prohibited in some place especially in malls Our approach characterizes shops from mobile sensing data and infers shop brand names from SSID information In summary ShopProìler is unique in leveraging customer traces and mobile sensing data to categorize shops and infer brand names from SSID Moreover it allows for automatically detecting boundary in malls IX C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we presented ShopProìler as a automatic proìling system ShopProìler adopts novel approaches to depict details inside shopping malls including shop type and brand name In addition our proposed methods are able to improve the accuracy of building oor plan by signiìcantly reducing FP rate compared with previous methods The whole process is autonomous without human intervention and only relies on sensor readings from mobile phones via crowdsourcing First we extract customer movement patterns from real traces Second we adopt a gradient-based approach to detect shop boundary and pinpoint shop location through WiFi heat map construction Third we categorize shops by design a SVM classiìer Finally we nd that SSID is a good indicator to infer shop names Therefore we applying string similarity measurement to label shops Through real traces from three malls we conìrmed the merits of our system Our system can be improved in the following aspects First currently there are six classes in our ShopProìler More classes can be deìned by exploring peopleês behavior in depth Second power consumption is another importance issue in mobile phone based Battery drains v ery f ast when continuously using build-in sensors and WiFi modules ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
