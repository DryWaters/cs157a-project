Abstract Background 
machine\One of the challenges is that there are usually too many similar rules to be extracted by the rule mining 
Aim Method 
This paper proposes a rule reduction technique that can eliminate complex \(long\ and/or similar rules without sacrificing the prediction performance as much as possible The notion of the method is to removing long and similar rules unless their confidence level as a heuristic is high enough than shorter rules. For example, it starts with selecting rules with shortest length \(length=1\nd then it continues through the 2nd shortest ru les selection \(length=2 based on the current confidence level, this process is repeated 
Result Conclusion 
on the selection for longer rules until no rules are worth included An empirical experiment has been conducted with the Mylyn and Eclipse PDE datasets. The result of the Mylyn dataset showed the proposed method was able to reduce the number of rules from 1347 down to 13, while the delta of the prediction performance was only .015 \(from .757 down to .742\rms of the F1 prediction criteria. In the experiment with Eclipsed PDE dataset, the proposed method reduced the number of rules from 398 to 12, while the prediction performance even improved \(from .426 to .441 The novel technique introduced resolves the rule 
explosion problem in association rule mining for software proneness prediction, which is significant and provides better understanding of the causes of faulty modules

I  I NTRODUCTION  According to Pareto's law that 80 percent of the faults can be found in 20 percent of the modules, identification of fault-prone modules is an important challenge for effective testing and/or software inspection [1    1 8  To  d a t e v a ri ous m u ltivari at emodeling techniques applicable to fault-prone module prediction 
have been used, including the most commonly used linear discriminant analysis gistic regre s s io n a n aly sis [16  classification suppor t vector m achine[6] and rand o m  forest [1  However, the problem common to all these prediction models is that the model itself is not easily understandable to human, that is software engineers cannot easily recognize and agree as why a certain module is faulty \(or not faulty.\en a simplest linear discriminant model, correlations between predictor variables makes it difficult to interpret their coefficients clearly. In addition such difficulties can be easily interpreted as a negative opinion this technique \(or model\ not fit to our projecté, which is 
commonly uttered by engineers who do not wish to use any newer techniques in their project This paperês primary focus is on the association rule mining described in 22], which a r e much m ore understandab le sinc e rules are described in a simple and intuitive form \(condition

than 20 and its fan-in is larger than 10. When such rules were derived from a past projectês module dataset, we could use them for the prediction of an ongoing or a future planned project However, as we will explain in Section II

association rule mining suffers from a problem which also makes human understanding difficult, i.e. there are too many similar rules and/or complex rules are mined. In our study, the Mylyn data set \(consists of 13 metrics of 1023 modules\ced 1346 rules even though we only have mined the high confidence 0020.75\s \(see Section V\. We could reduce these rules by

commonly used rule measures such as confidence and support, but using these measures cannot reduce similar rules or complex rules Instead of using these measures, we could remove complex rules by mining simple rules only \(whose antecedents are short\in this case we may sacrifice the prediction accuracy Based on the above discussion, this study attempts to balance the following two requirements Remove similar and/or complex rules as much as possible from a rule set At the same time, not sacrificing the prediction performance To achieve these requirements simultaneously, we propose a new algorithm for rule reduction. The notion of this algorithm is to reduce long \(complex\s as much as possible unless their confidence is enough higher than similar shorter rules. We will show the effectiveness of the algorithm using the Mylyn and Eclipse PDE datasets in our experiment The next section introduces association rule mining and its rule explosion problem. Followed by Section III, in which we propose an algorithm for rule reduction. Section IV describes an experiment setting to evaluate the algorithm and Section V describes the result and discussion of the experiment. We summarize this paper and presents future research directions in Section VI  II  B ACKGROUND   R ULE MINING AND ITS EXPLOSION PROBLEM  Association rule mining is a typical method for discovering the patterns of co-occurrences of the attributes in a dataset. Below we introduce its details, related work and the rule explosion problem Association rule mining is also referred to as an association analysis. Its applications have been applied to discover associations hidden amongst data in the POS \(Point-Of-Sales product-purchasing logs of retail stores c e s s  log s of website  teins 1 9 etc In  the  ca s e of POS logs  res earch er s h ave  mined rules about products purchased together, such as purchases product B  be a set of items where each 1 \004 004  an item and is the number of unique items. An association rule is denoted by an expression  where          We refer to as the of the rule, and as the of the rule. Let a database be where   is called a transaction is the number of transactions. We call satisfies the rule  if       holds In the POS log example corresponds to a log of all past purchases and   corresponds to one purchase by a customer corresponds to all unique products sold   corresponds to one or more products purchased   corresponds to a product purchased together with  In this paper, the expresses a condition of module metrics and the consequent denotes either a module is faulty \(i.e. a module contains one or more fault\ or not faulty \(i.e. a module contains no fault\The association analysis is normally applied to qualitative variables \(ordinal scale variables\ ratio scale and interval scale variables are generally pre-processed and transformed to ordinal scale variables before rule mining. For example, it would be possible to transform çcyclomatic number and çfan-iné into ordinal scale variables consisting of three categories Ñ low [0, 10\edium  [10, 30\ and high [30 A fan-in = high Support is an indicator of rule frequency. It is expressed as support  which is equal to  where           and   Confidence is the probability that consequent will follow antecedent It is expressed as confidence  is equal to  where is defined as in Support and        For example, assuming that the number of modules expressed as 20, the number of modules that satisfies is 10, the number of modules that satisfies is 8, and the number of modules that satisfies both and is 6. For the rule  the support is .3 6/20\onfidence is .6 \(= 6/10 We also define the of a rule as follows Length is an indicator of ruleês complexity \(larger length indicates more complex rules\It is expressed as length  which is equal to the number of items in  For example, the length of the rule ç\(cyclomatic number fan-in = high We call that a rule  subsumes a rule  if C  A For example, a rule ç\(cyclomatic number = medium fan-in high A rule set obtained by association rule mining is often used as rules for the future business. In general, higher confidence \(or support\ield higher prediction accuracy thus, after rules are mined from module metrics and fault data sets a set of rules whose confidence \(or support\greater than their threshold or are selected and used for their prediction To conduct a prediction, given a selected rule set and a target module to be predicted, we need to consider that more than one rules can match the module, that is, module metrics satisfy the antecedent means of multiple rules.

matched rules had different consequents \(faulty and not-faulty typical way to handle this situation is to classify the module by the majority of rulesê consequent [7 wa y is to s e lec t th e longest rules among matched rules [22 We also need to consider the cases where no rule matches the module. In such cases, Kamei et al. proposed to conduct a modelbased prediction as a complementary me This paper employs a novel approach to prediction. To keep the rule set small and understandable, we mined rules whose consequent is çfaultyé only, where non-faulty rules are ignored. If one or more rules match the module, then we consider it is faulty Otherwise, we classify it as non-faulty. By selecting high confidence \(and support\les, we could also obtain promising prediction accuracy with çfaultyé rules only \(see Section V A number of cases studied have reported association rule mining for a software related dataset. Kamei et al. proposed a hybrid faulty module prediction method combining association rule mining with a model based approach \(logistic regression analysis for the purpose of improving the performance of fault-prone module predictio   m i ned a ssociation rules f r om defect data logg ed  during development \(type of defect cause, correction effort, etc to predict types of defects that would occur simultaneously and to predict defect-correction effort \(staff-hours: çone hour or less one hour to one dayé, çone day to three daysé, and çmore than three daysé\.  Hamano et al col le cted  ri sk e v alua tion  m etrics  in software development, and conducted association analysis to reveal project-confusion factors \(whether development budgets or deadline standards will be overrun\ichail ound reuse  patterns of libraries in application software by using association rule mining, and tried to use the derived patterns in building a class library Morisaki et al e d  a n extended association rule m i ning method that takes advantage of interval and ratio scale variables instead of simply replacing them into nominal or ordinal variables In the proposed method, an extended rule describes the statistical characteristic of quantitative variables \(e.g. mean and standard deviation\in the consequent part together with related metrics \(e.g lift of meané and çlift of standard deviationé\ so that conditions producing distinctive statistics can be discovered as rules. They also conducted an empirical study to reveal rules associated with defect correction effort of an industry project However, none of these studies focused on reducing the rule set to solve the which we will explain in the next subsection Rule explosioné effect refers to the fact that an excessive number of rules are generated by the association rule mining technique This causes the following problems for human understanding Similar rules are included in the derived rule set. For example, we may have a slightly different two rules 005\003\006\003\007\003\010 Some rules subsumes other rules. For example, ç\005\003\006 Some rules are very long. Usually long rules are difficult to interpret by human. For example, ç\005\003\006\003\007\003\010\003\011\003\012\003\013 Confidence=82 Rule #2\\005\003\006\003\007 Given a rule set, our goal is to remove as many rules that are \(1 similar to others, \(2\umed by other rules or \(3\plex \(i.e long\le not losing the prediction performance of the rule set Our basic idea is to evaluate the tradeoffs between and of a rule. We remove rules unless they have enough confidence for their length. Suppose we have the following two rules in the derived rule set Rule #1\\005\003\006 Confidence=82 Rule #2\\005\003\012\003\007 Confidence=82 Rule #2\ \005\003\012\003\011 
rule explosion problem length confidence 
002  faultyé subsumes ç\005\003\006\003\007 002 faultyé. From the point of view of prediction, the latter rule is not needed 
002  faultyé and ç\005\003\006\003\007\003\011 002 faultyé in the rule set. This makes it difficult for an engineer to decide which rule should be focused on 
002  faultyé is too complex to understand. Moreover, very long rules can cause overfitting problem There are several possible ways to reduce the rules. A typical practice is to select high confidence \(or support\ rules. For example, suppose we have the following four rules and confidence values Rule #1\\005\003\006 002 faulty 000\003 002 faulty      Confidence=83 Rule #3\\005\003\012\003\011 002 faulty Confidence=92 Rule #4\\012\003\013 002 faulty Confidence=30 In this case, rule #4 can be removed by setting a threshold value e.g. minimum confidence = 70%\ rule selection. However rules #1,2,3 still remain, thus we cannot solve neither of the problems P1, P2 and P3 above We could also reduce the rules by setting the threshold values to the length of rules \(e.g. maximum length = 2.\ In this case, rules 2 and #3 are removed; however, the rule #3 should not be removed because it has very high confidence \(92%\to consider that some long rules are worth selecting if they have high indication of confidence, i.e. they are likely to increase the prediction accuracy On the contrary, we could reduce the rules by selecting long rules rather than short rules since selecting longer rules is one of the promising practices in rule-based prediction By  this  approach, problem P2 may be solved, but P1 and P3 cannot be solved. In addition, we need to consider that not all the longer rules are worth selecting than the shorter rules, as we will explain in the next section III  P ROPOSED M ETHOD  002 faulty 000\003 002 faulty      Confidence=83 In this case, rule #2 is longer \(i.e. more difficult to understand than rule #1. We consider that rule #2 is NOT worth selected because it could gain only 1% improvement \(in confidence increasing the length. Since the longer rules are more difficult to understand, we do not select longer rules unless it yields acceptable improvements in confidence, as shown in the following example Rule #1\\005\003\006 002 faulty 000\003 002 faulty Confidence=92 In this case, we consider that rule #2 is worth selecting because enough improvement \(10% in confidence\ is achieved. If we remove rule #2, then we might lose the prediction accuracy. To

We compare the proposed with other rule reduction methods namely çnaÔve 1é and çnaÔve 2.é The naÔve 1 method is a conventional rule reduction method that relies on the threshold in confidence only. Rules can be reduced by increasing the threshold  The naÔve 2 method is a combination of the naÔve 1 method and a rule removal method that eliminates long rules subsumed by shorter rules. This method is intended to understand how much rules are subsumed by other rules. In this method, the shortest rules are selected based on a given threshold then longer rules are selected unless they are not subsumed by shorter rules Also, we compare with four commonly used machine learning techniques: logistic regression, random forest, CART and naÔve Bayes classifier Given an initial rule set of Mylyn \(Table IV\ run the proposed algorithm \(Fig.1\ different threshold values, from  0 up to 0.15 where all çlength \002 3é rules were removed. For each reduced rule set, we apply it to the Mylyn v2.0 dataset and compute evaluation criteria shown in Section IV.E. Similarly, for Eclipse PDE rule set, we run the proposed algorithm with 0 up to 0.3; and, for each reduced rule set, we apply it to the Eclipse PDE v3.2 dataset for performance evaluation We run naÔve 1 and 2 methods, which removes rules whose confidence values are smaller than the given threshold  For Mylyn dataset, we start with 0.78 up to 0.95 where all çlength \004 3é rules were removed. Similarly, for Eclipse PDE dataset, we start with 0.70 up to 0.86 V  R ESULT AND D ISCUSSION  Fig.2 and 3 show the overview of the result for Mylyn and Eclipse PDE respectively. The upper graph shows reduction of the number of rules, and the lower graph shows the reduction of the total rule length. As the number of rules and the total rule length reduces, the conventional method \(naÔve 1\, which reduces rules by the threshold in confidence, loses prediction accuracy \(in terms of F 1 value.\the contrary, our proposed method sustains high prediction accuracy Regarding the naÔve 2 method, it showed better performance than the naÔve 1 method, which indicates the effectiveness of eliminating long rules that are subsumed by shorter rules. In Mylyn dataset, 1287 out of 1347 \(95.5%\ rules were subsumed by shorter rules. However, giving higher threshold and the number of rules became smaller than 60, the prediction accuracy dropped down much more than the proposed method. This indicates the proposed methodês advantage of setting thresholds based on the length of rules. Similarly in Eclipse PDE dataset, the naÔve 2 method did better than the naÔve 2 method; however when the number of rules became smaller than 20, the prediction accuracy dropped down greatly

Details of results are shown in Table VI and VII. For Mylyn dataset, in Table VI \(a\, the proposed method could reduce the number of rules from 1347 down to 13, while the delta of the prediction performance is only .015 \(from .757 down to .742 terms of the F 1 value. On the other hand, in Table VI \(b\ and \(c naÔve 1 and 2 methods could also reduce the number of rules however, F 1 value became extremely low.

Table VIII and XI show the prediction performance of commonly used machine learners, compared with the proposed method \(i.e prediction by the reduced rule set\Mylyn and Eclipse PDE respectively. In Mylyn dataset \(Table VIII\the proposed method and tree-based methods \(Random Forest and CART outperformed other two methods \(logistic regression and naÔve Bayes classifier\ in terms of F1 value. In Eclipse PDE dataset Table IX\the proposed method outperformed other four methods in F1 value. These results indicate that the proposed association rule mining approach is able to produce accuracy that is comparative to commonly used machine learners Table X shows the details of rules in the reduced rule set \(13 rules\ed by the proposed method with a threshold  07 in Mylyn dataset. Although interpretation of rules itself is not the main scope of this paper, here we try to give a possible interpretation of rules. \(Due to page limitation, this Section investigates Mylyn dataset only There are 8 shortest \(length=2\rules, and all of them consist in their antecedent çTPC = H,é which means the number of revisions of a file is high \(TPC \002 3.\tes the frequent revisions to a module is the most influential factor of fault injection in the Mylyn dataset. This corroborates the results of previous studies    we ver, the  con dition çT P C H alon e is no t sufficient to have a consequent çfaulty.é Looking at rules no. 1-8 in Table X, either of çNOF = Hé, çNBD = Hé, çFOUT = H NSF = Hé, çVG = Hé, çPAR = Hé, çNOM = Hé or çNOT = H is needed in addition to çTPC = Hé to have a fault with high confidence level \(\002 0.75.\ These metrics include control flow complexity \(NBD and VG\ta complexity \(PAR, NOF and NSF\, inter-module complexity \(FOUT\ and size metrics \(NOM and NOT\Therefore, it can be interpreted as that the fault is injected when the revision to a module is frequent and the module has high complexity or its size is large Next we focus on rules no.9 and no.10. It can be considered that these rules expand the preconditions of shorter rules no.7 and no.3 While the rule no.7 requires NOM to be çHé, the rule no.9 allows NOM  = Mé by adding çNSM = Hé to its antecedent. Similarly while the rule no.3 requires TPC to be çHé, the rule no.10 allows TPC  = Mé by adding çNSM = H Next we focus on the rule no.11. Interestingly, this rule consists in its antecedent çNOF = Lé, which means the number of attributes zero. At the same time, this rule requires çFOUT = Hé \(the number of method calls of a file \00233\and çNOM = Hé \(the number of methods \0028\hese characterize a module having no attributes while it has many methods and many method calls to other classes On the other hand, the rule no.12 consists çNOM = Lé \(the number of methods \004 2\çNBD = Mé \(nested block depth = 1 NSF = Hé \(the number of static attributes \002 1\ and çNSM = L the number of static methods = 0\his indicates that a module of less branching complexity with just one or two methods can have a fault if it has one or more static attributes Finally, the rule no.13 consists of many complexity metrics included in the shortest rules, while it does not consist TPC which is the most influentia l factor of fault injection. This indicates that regardless of the frequency of revisions, a module can have a fault if the module is complex enough The analysis above confirmed that interpretation of a rule set became possible by our proposed rule reduction algorithm In this section, we discuss the threats to the validity of our work We used datasets collected from two projects. We need to analyze other open source and closed source systems to generalize our results. In addition, the set of metrics used to extract association rules is by no means complete. Thus, using other metrics may yield different results. However, we believe that the same approach can be applied on any set of metrics We used recall, precision and F 1 value to evaluate the prediction performance of rule sets. We need to use other criteria such as ROC curves [10 incr e a se the  reli abil i t y of our resul ts  This study obtains the number of faults in source code files using the SZZ algorithm. The algorithm is commonly used in fault prediction researches  but ha s the lim i ta tion th at faults  not recorded in CVS log comments cannot be collected. Further research is required to improve the accuracy of faults collection from repositories To mine enough initial rules before applying our rule reduction method, this paper set threshold values 01 and  75 for Mylyn v.1.0 dataset and 02 and 65 for Eclipse PDE v3.1 dataset. Since these values may affect the result of rule reduction and prediction, we need to conduct further experiments using different values We used rules whose consequent is çfaultyé only, where nonfaulty rules are ignored. Although we could obtain promising prediction accuracy with faulty rules only, further research is required to confirm whether non-faulty rules are indeed needless or not in fault prediction. To use both faulty and non-faulty rules one of the issues we need to address in future is how to conduct prediction for modules that are not included in both faulty and non-faulty rules

In the Mylyn dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from1347 down to 13, while the delta of the prediction performance was only .015 \(from .757 down to .742\terms of the F1 value. And, in the Eclipse PDE dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from 398 to 12, while the prediction performance even improved \(from .426 to .441 On the other hand, two naÔve rule reduction methods, which simply remove rules whose confidence values are smaller than the given threshold, could also reduce the number of rules, but in these cases the prediction performance became extremely low We compared our rule-based prediction with conventional model-based approaches such as logistic regression, random forest, CART and naÔve Bayes classifier. As a result, the proposed association rule mining approach was able to produce accuracy that is comparative to commonly used machine learners. This indicates the reduced rule set is worthwhile and important Through an analysis of a reduced rule set, it is confirmed that our proposed rule reduction technique provides a better understanding of the causes of faulty modules Part of this work was conducted under Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research \(C 24680003  Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T. and Swami, A.: Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc. of 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intêl Conf. on Management of Data,Washington, D.C., USA, pp.207-216 \(1993  D'Ambros, M., Lanza, M., Robbes, R.: Evaluating Defect Prediction Approaches: a Benchmark and an Extensive Comparison, Empirical Software Engineering, Published online, DOI 10.1007/s10664-011-9173-9, \(2011  Eclipse Mylyn Open Source Project http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn   Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment \(PDE http://www.eclipse.org/pde   Hamano, Y., Amasaki, S., Mizuno, O. and Kikuno, T Application of Association rule mining to Analysis of Risk Factors in Software Development Projects, JSSST Computer Software, Vol.24, No.2, pp.79-87\(2007  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., and Matsumoto, K.: Empirical Evaluation of SVM-based Software Reliability Model, In Proc. 5th ACM-IEEE Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering \(ISESE2006\p.39-41\(2006  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., Morisaki, S., and Matsumoto, K.: A Hybrid Faulty Module Prediction Using Association Rule Mining and Logistic Regression Analysis, In Proc. 2nd Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement \(ESEM2008\p.279-281\(2008  Kim, S., Whitehead, Jr., E.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
