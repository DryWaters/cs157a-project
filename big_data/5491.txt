A new model of immune genetic algorithm is formulated for solving this problem. This algorithm uses three-segment chromosomes, integrating the discretization, attributes reduction and mining association rules. And immune mechanism is introduced into genetic algorithm to avoid premature phenomenon and improve the efficiency of GA. The results of experiments prove the correctness and validity of the algorithm Keywords- association rules; genetic algorithm discretization; three-segment chromosomes; immune mechanism I.  INTRODUCTION Discovering association rules is an important task. The common methods are Apriori[1], FP-growth[2], genetic algorithm[3], and et al. These algorithms generally deal with discrete data. But actually most data sets are composed of both discrete and continuous attributes. The common process[4] for mining association rules from continuous data is discretization of continuous attributes first, and then extraction of association rules. Throughout the process, the initial discretization and the follow-up rules extraction are completely independent. The initial discretization may make the loss of the original information, and make mistakes for the rules extraction To solve the above problems, a new model of immune genetic algorithm is put forward. It integrates the discretization of continuous attributes, reduction of attributes and the rules extraction. The model uses three-segment structure of chromosomes. The first segment searches the 


best cut-points sets of the continuous attributes; the second and the third segment mine rules based on the cut points selected by the first segment. Some attribute is redundant when the cut-points set of it is empty, and then it can be removed. According to this model, the best set of cut points the set of reduced attributes and the set of association rules are obtained at the same time. Immune mechanism is introduced into the genetic algorithm. According to the principle of the immune balance, the immune genetic algorithm can restrain and promote the individuals concentration in the population self-adaptively. And it also can improve the local and global search ability of the genetic algorithm to avoid premature in order to keep the population diversity. Experiments show that this method can not only effectively extract the association rules but also has obvious advantages compared with Apriori and SGA The structure of this paper is as follows: Section II reviews the association rules. Section III presents the new model of immune genetic algorithm. Section IV presents the details of the algorithm. Section V presents the experiments and results. Section VI concludes this paper II. ASSOCIATION RULES The basic concepts of mining associations are given as follows[1 Let 1 2 m I }I I I= be a set of items and 1 2  n D t t t= be a set of transactions, where ti is a set of items such that t Ii ? . An association rule is an implication of the form X Y? , where ,X Y I?  and X Y? = ?  . The rule X Y?   holds in the set D with support and confidence where support is the percentage of transactions in D that contain both X and Y, and confidence is the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also contain Y. An association rule must satisfy a user-set minimum support\(minsup minconf rule X Y?   is called a strong association rule if support ? minsup and confidence ? minconf Usually association analysis is not given decision 


attributes so that we can find association and dependence between attributes to the best of our abilities. But the aimless analysis may take much time and space. Decision attributes determined can reduce the amount of candidate sets and searching space, and then improve the efficiency of algorithms to some extent[5].In addition, users are not interested in all association rules, but they are just concerned about the associations among condition attributes and decision attributes. So, in this paper we just mine association rules with decision attributes, in that, we consider attributes which users are concerned about as decision attributes and other attributes as condition attributes If mining association rules from continuous attributes data, the continuous attributes have to be discretized first The essence of discretization is to use the selected cut-points to divide the values of the continuous attributes into intervals. The methods of dividing determine the quality of association rules[6]. Optimal discretization has been proved to be NP problem[7], while the genetic algorithm has good 1447 optimization. In this paper, genetic algorithm is used to search the cut-points of the continuous attributes III. A NOVEL MODEL OF IMMUNE GENETIC ALGORITHM Genetic algorithm is the optimization technique based on natural selection and biological genetic mechanisms[8]. It approaches to the optimal solution of the problem based on the natural random algorithm. But the traditional genetic algorithm has some inevitable disadvantages. For example, it is easy to fall into local optimal solution, resulting in premature convergence, i.e., premature phenomenon Therefore immune mechanism[9] is introduced in to calculate the individuals concentration in the populations According to the new selection strategy presented in this paper based on the concentration and fitness, the new algorithm selects individuals that are better than the previous generation to generate the new generation A. Coding Scheme For example, let data set S=\(A,B,D a1,a2 the continuous attributes set, and the candidate cut-points of each attribute in A set are respectively \(1,2.1,3.5,4 0.5,2,5.1 b1,b2 values of each attribute are respectively \(x, y, z m, n 


D=\(d1, d2 each attribute are respectively \(0, 1 0, 1,2 In this paper, it adopts binary encoding. The individual code is shown in Figure 1\(based on the above example         The first segment is a cut-points genome, which denotes all cut-points of the continuous attributes. The total length of this segment is the sum of the cut-points. Each one gene bit is corresponding to each cut-point. 1 indicates to select that cut-point, and the corresponding gene bit of the second segment is also in working state. 0 indicates not to select the cut-point, and the corresponding gene bit of the second segment is in dormant state. In Figure 1, the string 0110010 indicates that the attributes a1, a2 respectively select the cutpoints \(2.1, 3.5 2 The second segment is encoded for the hybrid data. The genome is divided into two parts. The first part is encoded for continuous attributes based on the selection of the cutpoints of the first segment. The code length is the same as the first segment. In this segment, each gene bit indicates that the values of a continuous attribute are divided into two intervals based on the corresponding cut-point of the first segment. 1 indicates that value>corresponding cut-point, and 0 indicates that value <=corresponding cut-point. For example, in Figure 1, 1100110 shows attribute a1 is divided into the interval a1>2.1, a1<=3.5 based on cut-points 2.1,3.5 point\(2 The second part is encoded for the discrete attributes This part is relatively simple. Each one gene bit is corresponding to each discrete attribute value. The total length equals to the sum of the number of values. In the string, 1 indicates to select the corresponding value, and 0 indicates not to select the corresponding value. If some attribute may select any value, the corresponding locations in 


the binary string are 1. For example, in Figure 1, 10011 indicates that b1=x, b2 can take any one of m, n The third segment is encoded for the decision attributes Each gene bit is corresponding to each decision attribute value. Its length equals to the sum of the number of decision attribute value. In the string, 1 indicates taking the corresponding value, 0 indicated not taking the corresponding value. If the number of 1 in the genome of some decision attribute is greater than or equal to 2, it indicates that this rule select two or more values of this decision attribute, and then it is considered the genome of this attribute is invalid. We do not select any values of this attribute. In Figure 1, 01110 indicates that d1=1, and the genome of d2 has two 1, so we do not select any value of d2 that is, this rule is only related to d1 According to the above, in Figure 1, the chromosome is decoded into the rule: 12.1 3.5 a< <= and 2 2 a > and 1b x and 2b m=  or 2b n=  1 1d? = . If each genome in the third segment is invalid or all 0, but the other gene bits in that individual may be good. Therefore, we assign such individual a smaller fitness rather than simply abandon it in order to inherit the better genes B. Fitness Function Fitness function is the only interface of the application and genetic algorithm, and its structure impacts the efficiency of the algorithm directly. The support is a measure of the importance of the association rules. In this paper, we use the support to filter rules. Therefore, the fitness function can be defined as follows    f X p support\(X X q support\(X     1 Where Support\(X through genetic operation, minsup is the minimum support 


threshold given by users. When an individual X meets the requirements of users, its fitness function value should be greater than 1. Otherwise, the fitness function value is less than 1, and this individual will be eliminated in the next generation of genetic algorithm C. Selection Strategy Based on Self-Adaptive Suppression and Promotion The diversity of individuals is maintained by the individuals self-regulation[10]. The individuals selfregulation depends on the individuals fitness and concentration. When the concentration is constant, the greater the fitness is, the greater the probability of the individual being selected is. When the individuals fitness is constant, the greater the concentration is, the smaller the probability of the individual being selected is. This algorithm Figure 1.  Three-segment chromosomes first segment second segment third segment 0110010 01110   1100110 10011 1448 eliminates the individuals whose fitness value is less than 1 first, and then puts the individuals whose fitness value is greater than 1 in a new population. In this population, the selection probability Pi of the individual Xi is defined as 1   M j dif Xii f Xj e     2 Where ? is an adjustment factor which is a constant greater than zero, generally ?=1. di is the concentration of the individual, which  is defined as the number of individuals whose N-1 i jsdi 


 3 Where N is the population size, ? is the similarity constant which takes 0.75 1?? ? in this paper. ,i js is the similarity which is the degree of similarity of any two individuals Xi and Xj, i.e  the number of gene bits in which X  is same as the length of the chromosome i j i Xj s =      \(4 i js ? [0,1], if ,i js equals to 1, it is indicated that the two individuals are the same. While ,i js is equal to 0, it is indicated the two individuals are entirely different There are several advantages of this selection strategy The larger the individuals fitness is, the greater the probability of the individual being selected is. It ensures that the individuals which have greater fitness can be retained The fitness plays a promotive role and accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. The higher individuals concentration is, the smaller the probability of the individual being selected is. It ensures the diversity of the population The concentration plays a suppressive role and avoid premature D. Genetic Operation Genetic algorithm uses genetic operators to carry out selection, crossover and mutation on the population, and thus get a new generation of population. The genetic operators determine the search capability and convergence of the algorithm 1 chromosome in the population to the corresponding rule and then calculates selection probability Pi for each rule based on formula \(2 2 crossover. In detail, it classifies the domain of each attribute into a group and classifies the cut-points of each continuous attribute into one group. And then the crossover is carried out between the corresponding groups of two individuals by a certain rate 3 


mutated by a certain rate, that is, changing 0 to 1, 1 to 0 E. Attributes Reduction After the algorithm is finished, if the genome of some attribute x in the chromosome are all 0, it indicates that the cut-points set of it is empty, that is, attribute x is redundant for the decision-making and can be removed. Reduction set of attributes can be obtained by scanning chromosomes in the optimal population F. Terminating Condition The algorithm finally extracts the rules that meet the confidence threshold given by users, so the final output is not one optimal rule, but rather a set of rules that meet the threshold. The termination conditions we set are: the termination generation is 400, or there is no one rule less than threshold for the continuous 10 generations G. Rules Extraction The frequent rules are generated according to the fitness function and genetic operators. In order to mine the strong association rules finally, these rules must be extracted again Extraction criteria are: output the rule which meets the minimum confidence given by users, otherwise abandon it  IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM According to the thinking above, a new model of immune genetic algorithm for mining association rules MAR_IGA Step1: Initialization. Let evolution generation count t=0 Determine the population size N and minsup, minconf Randomly generate an initial population G\(t Step2: Calculate each individuals fitness in the population G\(t 1 individual. If each genome in the third segment of some chromosome is invalid or all 0, we assign such chromosome a smaller fitness Step3: Filter individual according to the fitness value.

Restore each chromosome in the final population to the rule, and calculate the confidence of each rule. If confidence ? minconf , output the rule 1449 V. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS A. Descriptions of Experimental Data Sets and the Environment The experiment uses Abalone dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository. The data set has 4177 samples It is composed of a discrete attribute and 8 continuous attributes. In this paper, we only mined such association rules X Y?  that Y was age. The setting of parameters: The size of evolutionary population N=40, crossover rate=0.95 mutation rate=0.01, minsup=0.15, minconf=0.6. The ratio of training data and test data was 1:2. The experiment was executed on Celeron\(R was VC B. Results of the Experiments In order to test the validity of the algorithm MAR_IGA we compared MAR_IGA with the classical genetic algorithm SGA and Apriori. The process of using SGA is: firstly we extracted rules from the discrete data by SGA. Secondly we searched the optimal cut-points set of the continuous data by SGA, and then used SGA to extract rules from the continuous data based on cut-points. And finally we combined the above results of rule extraction as the final optimal population. The process of using Apriori is: firstly we discretized continuous attributes using the discretization method based on the importance of cut-points[11], and then extracted the rules by Apriori. These three methods were run on the above data set. The results are shown in Table I TABLE I.  COMPARISON OF THESE THREE METHODS 


 Number of cut-points Number of rules Number of reduction attributes Execution times\(s MAR_IGA 28 13 5 48 SGA 37 10 6 56 Apriori 30 13 8 70 It can be seen from Table I that the number of reduction attributes got from MAR_IGA is almost the same as SGA but in other areas obvious advantages can be seen compared with SGA. It indicates that MAR_IGA using the immune system is closer to the optimal solution of the problem than the simple genetic algorithm. In addition, the number of the cut-points got from MAR_IGA is almost the same as the number got from Apriori which uses discretization method based on the importance of cut-points. But the Apriori has almost not reduced attributes. It is shown that MAR_IGA has a good effect of the attributes reduction and can get the simple, effective rules while ensuring the importance of the cut-points. To sum up, MAR_IGA get less cut-points of the continuous attributes, take shorter experimental time and get more effective rules VI. CONCLUSION Data can be divided into discrete attributes data and continuous attributes data. A new immune genetic algorithm MAR_IGA is presented in this paper. This algorithm has the following characteristics It uses the chromosomes with three segments simultaneously searching the best cut-points sets of the continuous attributes and extracting association rules, and implying the attributes reduction The immune mechanism is introduced in. It improves the local optimization of genetic algorithm effectively, and ensures the population diversity Simple and effective association rules can be obtained, while not reducing the importance of cutpoints and maintaining the original indistinguishable

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
