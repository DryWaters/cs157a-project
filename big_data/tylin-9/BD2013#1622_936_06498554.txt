I I NTRODUCTION  Knowledge of the power grid system state and its 
dynamics and dependencies is one important prerequisite for a reliable control and understanding of the power system The worldwide integration of renewable energy sources in the power grid demands for a new dynamic grid architecture the so called Smart Grid [1 t h at i s p r opos ed t o r e pl ace  centralized grids. For its realization, it is necessary to have appropriate methods for detailed modeling and simulation at large scale based on the analysis of real measurements Available consumption data are not sufficient: The coarse time-scale of measurements by so called smart meters providing cumulated power value time-series with typical frequencies of only one sample per 1 to 15 minutes, may be 
used for short-term local load forecasts on a statistical level but are not sufficient for global fine grain analysis or for use in physical simulations that could increase the knowledge of dynamics and dependencies in the grid. Thus we designed a system for capturing, archiving and analyzing voltage data using our previously presented high-rate voltage measurement device with sub-second resolution called EDR Electrical Data Recorder\ and presented first feature extraction and analysis results [2  3   H o weve r  we  f o un d  that our current approach lacks data scalability and usability As a consequence, we evaluated new technology for the 
organization and analysis and organization of our data. We implemented first experimental processing of large amounts of archived data utilizing a Ha doop cluster together with Pig scripts and user-defined Pig functions \(UDF\nd compared its performance to classical sequential multi-threaded processing on a local multi core machine to find out which method is appropriate for which data scale and if our data allows efficient processing in Hadoop The paper is organized as follows: In chapter II we give an overview over re lated work and a problem description. In chapter III we describe our data and the cluster setup  In 
chapter IV the results of our performance analysis of distributed and local sequential processing are shown. We also discuss data visualization aspects for time series data from the LSDF. In chapter V we present new concepts for improvements II

R ELATED W ORK AND P ROBLEM I DENTIFICATION  Different groups have worked on capturing, archiving and analysis of voltage data. However, to our knowledge no such work has previously been done for long-term data analysis with synchronized sub second sampling, at least in 
Europe High-rate network analyzers capture more detailed data than smart meters but are currently only used on short-term failure analysis and not synchronized between different locations. Phasor measurement units \(PMUs\ are high speed sensors with the option for synchronous acquisition to enable monitoring of the power grid quality. However PMUs are rarely used in Germany and data from the real network are expensive [1   The Tennessee Valley Authority \(TVA

The entirety of the stream is passed to archiving servers. A real-time data stream is forwarded to a server program hosted by TVA which passes the data in a standard phasor data protocol IEEE C37.118-2005\to client visualization tools.

By the end of 2010 around 40TB of PMU data were collected, in the next 5 years 500TB of PMU data are expected additionally The Open Source Phasor Data Concentrator \(openPDC administered by the Grid Protection Alliance \(GPA\ [5  i s a  project providing a free software system designed to process streaming time series data in real-time. According to the homepage, measured data is gathered with GPS-time from many hundreds of input sources, time-sorted and provided to user defined actions. It is scalable and designed to consume all standard PMU input protocols. However performance statistics are logged every 10 seconds only Another free phasor data concentrator based on the IEEEC37.118 synchrophasor standard is iPDC It is more academic than openPDC and allows development and testing of algorithms and applications related to PMU data and may be used and modified without any restriction The project Lumberyard [7 provides scalable indexing and low latency fuzzy pattern searching in time series data It uses HBase \(a column ba sed Hadoop Storage\and iSAX   t o ach i eve bo t h  s c a l e a nd index/s e arc h respec t i v e l y   Lumberyard is based on iSAX and uses the jMotif Java library that provides symbolic aggregate approximation SAX\[9 and i SAX for ti m e s e ri e s da t a en abli ng ou tli er  detection and the search for often occurring patterns Our EDR measurements produce massive amounts of data every day and additional data will arise from power grid simulations. When measuring at the high rate of 25 kHz, each EDR produces ~16 GiB per day. This adds up to a total of 5.7 TiB per year per device, exceeding typical hard disk storage sizes. As soon as we add many devices or run simulations with virtual EDRs storing the data on disk drives connected to a single PC is obviously no longer possible and processing is not efficient In order to transform our data into useful and searchable scientific information we need new ways to manage archive, explore and analyze the resulting data because classical storage and mining methods were not found to be appropriate for huge amounts of data: As a first step to understand the meaning of the data, we wanted to compute some statistic measures for the time series. For small timeranges in measurement histor y, we implemented some basic sequential processing of the data. But the larger the size and number of data files that needed to be processed, the less appropriate classic sequential methods showed \(as to be presented in chapter IV\ To overcome these limits in time ranges and data sizes both for storage and processing, we searched for ways to bring comp utations and data residence together First, we need a data storag e that would not run out of space like traditional storage on hard disk and that would hold our valuable data fail-safe, e.g. by using redundant storage to enable maintenance and accessibility. Second, we need ways to access and analyze the data efficiently. It should be possible to flexibly analyze the archived data anytime afterward for arbitrary time-ranges and to quickly search and filter the data using customizable queries. For this, the storage should provide one namespace, so data distribution is abstracted for users. Also a graphical frontend for interactive navigation supported by different visualizations of the data was needed to provide some data overview We wanted to find out the scale at which distributed processing outperforms local parallel processing. Since the cluster our data resides on already has a Hadoop installation available, we tried utilizing its Map-Reduce framework to follow the approach of bringing the processing to the data rather than transferring data to processing units. A convenient way to do this was to write user defined functions \(UDFs\or Apache Pig \(see chapter II\By running the same experimental statistical analyses over differently sized test-data sets using this distributed setup on the one hand and more classical parallel processing on the other, we then tried to evaluate and compare both approaches. A good storage and processing approach is the precondition to start developing and implementing more sophisticated methods for analysis, classification and clustering of big datasets. This is due to the totally different design patterns and requirements for the archival data layout involved in both processing approaches III I NFRASTRUCTURE  AND D ATA L AYOUT  We utilize the Large Scale Data Facility \(LSDF\, which is currently maintained at KIT, Steinbuch Centre for Computing \(SCC\0  I t is de si g n ed to f u lf ill th e  requirements of different data intensive scientific experiments or applications. At the moment the Hadoop cluster available as part of the LSDF consists of 58 nodes with 464 physical cores in total, each node having 2 sockets with Intel Xeon CPU E5520 \(2.27GHz, 4 cores\, 36 GB of RAM, 2 TB of disk, 1 GE network connection, OS Scientific Linux 5.5 and Linux kernel 2.6.18. The two additional name nodes are identical to the data nodes except of the increased 96 GB of RAM and a 10 GE network connection. Clouderas distribution of Hadoop in version CDH3u4 is currently installed, providing different interfaces. We used the Apache Pig API. Pig consists of a high level data flow description language called Pig Latin and a server running on top of Hadoop that internally uses Map-Reduce We have two data sources: Collected measurement data produced by our EDRs and simulation data gathered at virtual smart meters in a power grid simulation model The investigation site is the Campus North \(CN\ of KIT which is an enclosed research center located near Karlsruhe One 110 kV incoming transmission line from the local energy supplier as well as one 2 MW block heating station also used for electrical power generation, provide its

electrical energy. 534 electrical active power consumption smart meters are installed at the KIT Campus North and data are available over years from a central database [3    Since February 2012 we additionally conduct continuous voltage time series measurements in the island-like electric network using our EDRs, where three phase voltages are acquired simultaneously at a typical rate of 10 kHz \(up to 25 kHz\A GPS pulse-per-second \(PPS\gnal is captured at the same time for synchronization purposes [2   Our EDR raw data is first stored locally on the disk drive of the PC that is recording the time series as xml-files. These are then aggregated at a file server, which writes the data to the Hadoop file system \(HDFS\sing Hadoops Java API Each xml-file contains the measured voltage-data for one minute in 60 one-second-blocks for each of the 3 phases stored as Base64 encoded 16 bit raw binary numbers. Some additional metadata is stored together with the raw data in the xml-files for each one second block describing the acquisition process and supplemental information. This data layout was designed when the first measurements were made in order to keep highest accuracy at lowest data transfer amount. Even if this layout does not seem to fit the idea of distributed processing on a Hadoop cluster, we need a way to process it after having collected daily measurements over nearly one year now in this format. We already have aggregated a large amount of time series data \(454747 files in 172 folders, 1117674 MiB\ with various recording sample rates. The amount of data is increasing by time and multiplies by the number of installed EDRs To understand the effects in a complex power grid we also put effort in its modeling. We developed the new software framework ASiMoV \(Electric Grid Analysis Simulation, Modeling and Visualization\ as a collection of multiple modules. The modeling module enables to interactively create a geo-information based representation of the power grid structure and components. We have access to the data of 534 smart meters at the KIT-CN which we utilize to simulate the currents based on the load and voltage profiles. We use GridLAB-D [11  as the simulation software Each virtual smart meter in the simulation model can record voltage and current for each phase per second; higher sampling rates will be supported in GridLAB-D v3. The output of the recorders is saved to individual CSV-files. The file sizes depend on the number of the smart meters the number of captured parameters e.g. current, voltage, the duration of the simulation and the sampling rate for the output The total data size also depends on the number of the simulation runs The expected data size per model can be calculated as 320.673 bytes          The constant value for the bytes was determined for   1 1h and 1sec. For a long-term simulation e.g. for 1 year will rise with the coefficient 8.765, for a high sample rate simulation according to the EDR resolution will rise with the coefficient up to 25.000. The KIT-CN model will produce 1,5 TB for one long-term simulation 534  1 1y 1sec The raw data files are transferred continuously to the LSDF's HDFS storage, where each day is represented by a folder containing all the data files, each holding the information of one minute. The file names allow the identification by date, time and the identifier of the measuring GPS device IV PERFORMANCE  ANALYSIS  OF  DATA  PROCESSING In this study we analyze the voltage time series data captured by one EDR-device at the KIT-CN for the month June 2012. We are interested in efficient analysis and the extraction of statistical information. As a first step to understand the meaning of the data and to evaluate different processing approaches, we wanted to compute some statistic measures for the time series data. In order to test the capabilities of the new technology \(Hadoop, Pig\ and the limits of PC computing for our data, we implemented the analysis algorithms on a multicore environment and on the Hadoop cluster. Further we measured the runtime for each step of the data visualization with direct LSDF access For comparing the performance of the statistical analysis for big data we developed a Java based multi-threaded application which was tested with two multicore PCs  Intel i5-2500 CPU, 4 cores, 3.3 GHz, 8GiB RAM, Win7 64Bit 2xIntel Xeon CPU, 8 cores, 3.0GHz, 16GiB RAM, Win7 64 Bit\. The multi-threaded application operates on measurement data which are stored locally. For testing purposes we concentrated on simple statistical calculations like the minimum, maximum, average and the standard deviations of minima and maxima for all three phases of the EDR-data. Since we are primarily interested in comparing the processing speed, the selected methods may be insufficient for serious electrical data analysis The same functionality for data decoding and the calculations was also implemented as a user-defined function UDF\ for use in Pig scripts. UDFs are compiled to MapReduce Code running distributed on a Hadoop cluster To be able to write and automatically start Pig Latin scripts from a development PC, the scripts were embedded in Java code. For this purpose, the Pig Java API provides a PigServer class, and methods for registering and running scripts. Using this API a function was implemented to run a simple Pig script that reads the data xml tags of all xml-files in a given HDFS folder and applies the processing of a UDF written in Java to it. The function includes all statistical analysis implementations in Java as well as the needed Base64 decoding. The compiled Java-class is packed into a jar file which has to be registered at the Pig server in order to use it in Pig scripts. Processing results are written to HDFS We analyzed voltage measurement data for time periods ranging from six hours \(~856 MiB, 1394 files\up to three weeks, which is about 69,7GiB in 30127 data files. The files had a Hadoop replication factor of 2, a HDFS block size of 64 MB was used. In Fig. 1 a comparison of the measured

time needed for the calculation of the statistical parameters on the multicore PCs \(multi-threaded Java code, 8 threads and with the Hadoop cluster is shown From 6,2GiB onwards Hadoop cluster processing is superior to multi-threaded data processing. Due to the advanced configuration of PC-2, processing times are shorter but both curves show similar characteristics. We can observe that Pig processing always needs a certain time for initialization of the Map-Reduce step \(creating and distributing jar-files\; even for small data sizes the initialization seems to be the retarding factor   Figure 1: Runtime comparison Pig/Hadoop cluster vs. multicore PCs  In a further step we examined the variation of the processing time for several runs within the Hadoop cluster We calculated the average and median values for five run time measurements for the same data configuration. During the execution we encountered two Hadoop socket warnings  for the combinations, which nearly doubled the execution time We developed a visualization module for the ASiMoV software, which scans the EDR raw data on the LSDF and sorts them due to the id of the EDR devices and the captured time intervals. We were interested in the analysis of the needed time for direct data retrieval from the LSDF and for the visualization with our current data organization For testing purposes we selected a 15 minutes interval of the voltage time series for July 21st, 2012 and measured the runtime for the data access, the data retrieval, the data processing and the data visualization. The 15 minute example described above needs about 105 seconds from the interactive selection of the time range to the visualization The data transfer from the LSDF is not the bottleneck for this short time range, rather the local data processing of the large data with Java. We verified this by measuring the necessary time for each processing step. As shown in the logarithmic diagram in figure 2 we performed six test runs. The most time consuming step is data decoding and the data formatting for the rendering module \(93.3%\This is followed by the parsing of the xml files \(4.43%\ with the SAX parser A drawback of this processing pipeline is the repeated necessary access to the LSDF and the calculation of the statistics from scratch. Local data processing after a data transfer from the LSDF will not make any sense for the expected size of our measured and simulated data   Figure 2: Runtime evaluation of data processing for LSDF data V P ROPOSED I MPROVEMENTS  Our experiences have reconfirme d that processing must be carried out near the data. This implies the data analysis and the preparation of data visualization. A further improvement will be the creation of metadata, which will structure our data and provide additional semantic information. The local runtime analysis also made clear, that the Base64 encoding of our raw data is computationally too intensive to scale with the data growth. We will have to accept increased file sizes and store values in a text based format One problem with the present data organization in the LSDF is its flatness \(one folder per day\ and the lack of metadata at higher data abstraction layers. Computing the total size of our data folder took more than five hours showing the access problems for unpartitioned data Currently, metadata is only kept for one second measurement intervals. It is desirable to also have information for longer time intervals, e.g. metadata for a specific day, month or year could describe the data characteristic for this time interval in a compressed manner and relate to events and properties in extern databases In order to access the data domain in a top-down manner a hierarchical metadata representation is proposed. We will explain this based on the introduced statistical functions. The procedure will give us the possibility to have information on the measured data at the top level \(year\, which contains value ranges for the minima, maxima, averages, etc Traversing the tree to significant data sections will be possible. In order to build up the hierarchical metadata structure we analyze the content of data blocks bottom-up then create metadata descriptions and merge in the next higher level \(time interval Figure 3 shows the principle: we have data blocks representing meta- and sample data for each second. Based on these data we calculate minima, maxima, average and standard deviations of minima and maxima. Based on 60 seconds data blocks we create a minute data block containing the ranges for all characteristics. We save the minima and maxima of these in the minutes description file. Also we

save the file names pointing to the measurement data files For the next hierarchy level, we group the metadata files into metadata files using the same principle, that is, we outline the value ranges for the characteristics obtained from the metadata files. This is repeated for each EDR until we reach the top of the hierarchy, the  metadata file. Currently this is defined as our top level which is stored separately for every EDR device   Figure 3: The proposed hierarchical metadata structuring and indexing  The collected information on a year basis is available separately and also processible for each EDR device. This indexing combined with the data analysis of specific characteristics can be done as a regular job for incoming new data. Additionally we will be able to submit queries for arbitrary time ranges, which could be computed efficiently from the metadata instead of the computation from raw data We will work on automated methods that will perform the analysis, indexing and structuring directly on the Hadoop cluster for our collected voltage time series measurements The data analysis methods will be extended for advanced state of the art analysis and mining. We plan to convert our measurement data to the SAX representation and make it indexable using the iSAX approach. Further we will concentrate on the compact visual presentation of and interaction with statistical analysis data for the proposed new data structure. Promising starting points are the intelligent icons approach [12  V izT re e  1 3 a n d the m e th od s in 1 4   that could provide a semantic overview of our datasets and their similarity. We also plan to develop methods for semantic searches, search by data \(similarity search\, dataset recommenders and classification as well as clustering using the metadata extracted by our analyses Further the optimization of the data transfer between EDR devices and the LSDF storage as well as the Pig scripts for speeding up data processing is an important topic. The security of the system will be another aspect that needs to be dealt with seriously. We will have to provide secure archiving and querying. This may include separation and anonymization of stored personal data e.g. by using pseudonyms and secure but fast encryption methods VI C ONCLUSION  We presented our approach for high rate voltage power network measurements using EDRs and data archiving and analysis problems and methods. We compared multi-core with distributed data processing for simple statistics analyses. For this purpose we developed the statistical analysis functionality in Java for both the Hadoop cluster using the Pig-API and the local environment. We could show that for data sets in our format exceeding ~6.2 GiB the usage of Pig in our Hadoop cluster is superior to classical multicore processing regarding processing speed and scalability We also introduced a new time-oriented schema for raw time series and metadata organization enabling fast and easy information retrieval R EFERENCES

their own local information, and identify which data potentially have a higher risk based on that external knowledge. Existing local data are labeled with external knowledge tags. The ability to combine the results of multiple neural networks from multiple or ganizations in real time, leads to far more reliable and useful knowledge products   Fig. 6. Neural network ma 3 tch example between 2 organizations  Ma 3 tch virtually integrates the emerging collective knowledge between organizations. Even better, organizations not only learn and apply what they already implicitly know but they learn and apply the distributed collective knowledge a high risk  transaction is identified \(Fig. 6\se transactions with similar patter ns are identified in 5 other organizations as high risk. This transaction would not have been identified based on local knowledge only. Similarly other data mining technique can ma 3 tch \(e.g., clustering classification, decision trees, n-grams, etc\. Prototyped examples include prediction of the gender or nationality of a person, based on first or last names of a person. All organizations locally train the ma 3 tch using their own local data, and utilize the combined networked intelligence to predict missing information. There are countless other examples, but the essence is to jointly build, share and utilize common standardized knowledge without the need to disseminate sensitive information  3  Strategic Ma 3 tch  Statistical ma 3 tch analysis enables strategic decision making. Statistics are automatically \(locally\extracted from sensitive information, and virtually integrated to achieve integral knowledge products. Ma 3 tch analysis of money flows identifies hidden distributed fina ncial trends in real time, for example to provide insight in local \(known\versus global unknown\ money flows \(Fig. 7\. It reveals money flows that are locally not available and ot herwise would have remained undetected \(i.e., FI and PL are unaware of the money flows from NL, NL is unaware of the money flow to BG    Fig. 7. Local money flows versus global money flows \(perspective NL  Trends, threats and irregularitie s can be detected as soon as they emerge, and automatically integrated with local data. For decision making this real time global view provides huge strategic advantages to all organizations participating in the ma 3 tch analysis. Combining the results of strategic ma 3 tches with directed neural network ma 3 tches or anonymous ma 3 tches, or even the underlying sensitive data, provides operational and knowledge insight into these strategic results  4  Social Network Ma 3 tch  Social network ma 3 tch enhances social network analysis by creating knowledge about missing entities and links. Social network analysis maps and me asures relationships and flows between people, groups, orga nizations and other connected information or knowledge entities. Common measures that provide insight into the various roles and groupings in a social network include: degree \(number of direct connections betweenness \(number of indirect connections\, closeness distance to entities in netw ork\ and bridges \(connecting different networks\ But a single piece of missing information severely impacts these measures. Virtual integration combining the information-, knowledge- and strategic ma 3 tch\, identifies new and/or similar entities, links and relations between \(otherwise disconnected\etworks \(Fig. 8  Fig. 8. Example where ma 3 tch completes loose ends  It allows parties to identify information links with other information \(distribu ted across databases to determine which role that information has in the global network. Parties can even identify that two or more en tities that locally seem to be disconnected, are actually related to each other based on information available at the other party \(missing links 


5  Technology Ma 3 tch  Ma 3 tch minimizes financial, legal, organizational, technical and informational implementation barriers, and maximizes the information and knowledge position of all parties connected to the virtual cloud. As connected parties share a common virtual enterprise architecture \(and vi rtual information architecture they can jointly develop or acquire new \(commercial information sources and services cost effectively, and seamlessly integrate these with their internal systems and databases supporting privacy, security or confidentiality. It reduces individual costs and further enhances and harmonizes their capabilities. It enables connected parties to act and operate as a single virtual enterprise  This enhances the local technology capabilities of the parties involved, and enables access to information and technologies otherwise too difficult or too costly to achieve Examples are \(anonymous\tegration with commercial\ases, but also with generic services like entity-extraction, geo-tagging, content translation, rule engines, etc   V  V IRTUAL I NFORMATION C LOUD I NFRASTRUCTURE   The physical infrastructure of the information oriented architecture and ma 3 tch is dynamic as well, and can run on low-end servers, and is vendor independent. In principle multiple nodes can run on a single \(virtual\er. Each time privacy, security, or information access is a concern, a new physical distributed node can be added. Organizations can directly or indire ctly connect to each other \(Fig. 9 Organizations may share a physical server \(Organization A and B\, have a dedicated server \(Organization C\use delegated servers for each of their resources \(Organization D   Fig. 9. Virtual Information Cloud Infrastructure  VI  M A 3 TCH O PPORTUNITIES   With ma 3 tch there is no need to exchange bulk information to achieve integral data fusion and analysis between parties and there is no need to entrust sensitive data to a third party Timeliness increases as relevant information is identified in real time, and is pushed or pulled when needed: no unnecessary information needs to be processed, cleaned or reviewed, which also prevents huge backlogs. Quality and reliability are enhanced as information can be processed interpreted, amended and checked for compliance at the source  Although the technology is designed for intelligence purposes, the dynamic architecture \(due to the large variety of information FIUs process\ makes it suitable for many other industries, and cross domain integration: government commercial, financial, telecom, biomedical, telecom, law enforcement, compliance, etc  At a national level many distributed government agencies deal with privacy sensitive information. They are expected to work together but are often \(not without reason\mited by privacy regulations. This may for example prevent or limit linking weapon permits to mentally ill patients, detecting abuse of social security systems, linking sexual offences to social services. When incidents happen, in many cases the information was available, but not connected where and when it was needed. Ma 3 tch makes it possible to find where this otherwise unknown\nt information is available in real time. This can help social security or tax officials to identify fraud, hospitals to identify emerging health threats, banks to conduct joint compliance and risk assessments, etc. It can be used to analyze distributed telecom/internet traffic to combat cybercrime, and could provide an alternative to centralized DNA or electronic patient file databases; at a national level but also at an international level  At international level benefits even further increase Countries have lots of comparable agencies that perform similar but distributed activities in each jurisdiction. Ma 3 tch allows agencies of countries with a shared mission to identify relevant remote information, and use each others knowledge to learn, cooperate and collaborate. For example to anonymously match convictions between countries in order to identify criminal activities moving across borders. When privacy sensitive data are involved, for example in international collaboration between intelligence agencies on money laundering and terrorist financing, ma 3 tch identifies links, threats, trends and shifts between countries that otherwise remain undetected. Similarly hospitals could ma 3 tch biomedical data to detect trends and threats in healthcare in real time. Ma 3 tch shifts the focus from reactive to proactive  


International law enforcement agencies \(like Interpol and Europol\ay use ma 3 tch for real time identification of relevant \(need to know\ information on ongoing cases. It provides virtual access to information when and where it is needed \(financial, telecom, intelligence, etc.\without the need for parties to expose sensitiv e information. The dynamic architecture allows matching virtually any kind of information from any source, at minimal co sts. Also cooperation between Europe and the United State  lik e P N R T F TP  cou l d benefit from the ma 3 tch, and build a collective intelligence and knowledge to identify relevant information, trends and threats as soon as they emerge, without infringing upon security confidentiality and privacy  Ma 3 tch and the information oriented architecture empower data minimization, proportionality and subsidiarity: the guiding principle within the European Union that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authorit It also e n ab les t h e availab il i t y  principle and the objective of the European Union for Member States to obtain information rapidly from private or public authorities of another Member State without the use of coercive measures. Despite of different legal systems and national regulations ma 3 tch enables collaboration opportunities far beyond existing limits and barriers  The information oriented architecture has proven its value as the foundation for FIU.NET: it enables autonomous governed information access, exchange and analysis between the national FIUs \(Financial Intelligence Units\ the EU member states. FIUs can virtually integrate their information without the need to place sensitive information beyond their organizations premises. Between the EU FIUs there are over 550 information resources, each with their own information standards, policies, processes and data protection rules and regulations. It provides FIUs with secure \(virtual\access to government and commercial databases through a customized unified interface, and allows them to innovate and acquire new services and information resources as one virtual enterprise  With the information ma 3 tch FIUs can detect relevant information between each other, but also with commercial data sources, without leaving an y traces. Within this diverse and complex environment, ma 3 tch technology enables joint information analysis and innovation capabilities otherwise impossible to achieve. But also at a national level FIUs can benefit from ma 3 tch to enhance local analysis capabilities, and by using it for \(cross border\reporting by exchanging ma 3 tch filters with reporting institutions \(reducing administrative burdens, and enhancing national investigations  FIUs have already named the emerging information and knowledge scarefully powerful, and now face a new challenge: to deal with the emerging streams of real time information and knowledge  DATA DATA KNOWLEDGE Structure, Patterns, Indicators WISDOM Understanding DATA DATA DATA  VIRTUAL INFORMATION Virtually Linked Elements    Context Connect Meaning Interpret Insight Learn  Ma 3 tch Decentralized Information Oriented Architecture  Fig. 10. Building a dynamic collective networked intelligence  VII  C ONCLUSIONS   Ma 3 tch builds a dynamic networked collective intelligence  Fig. 10\that provides participating parties with tremendous information and knowledge advantages. Relevant information links and knowledge distributed between parties are detected in real time as soon as they emerge. It gives governmental and commercial organizations a unique information and knowledge position that otherwise would be impossible to achieve. It provides a global overview for strategic decision making and generates knowledge that otherwise would remain distributed, hidden and undetected. Integral operational and strategic analysis on distributed data without infringing upon privacy or security advances results beyond what is otherwise possible. Privacy and knowledge do not conflict but strengthen each other, maximizing both privacy AND knowledge  The information oriented architecture provides a dynamic and flexible foundation for decentralized information access exchange, and anal ysis that enables unique strategic advantages. It enhances data minimization, proportionality and subsidiarity and maximizes voluntary and reciprocital communication, coordination, cooperation and collaboration It strengthens coherence and bridges legal, organizational informational and technological differences between autonomous parties. It shapes a dynamic virtual enterprise that enables parties to operate as one, and quickly and cost effectively adapt to emergi ng changes and opportunities  Understanding the ma 3 tch technology requires a paradigm shift, not just in understanding what is possible, but perhaps even more important in how organizations, governments central authorities, legislator s, data protection offices and information managers look at collaboration and information technology problems and solutions. Information from any national and/or international d ata source can be virtually integrated. It advances both privacy AND knowledge beyond conventional limitations: ma 3 tch opportunities start where other possibilities stop

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subows and can also handle short ows with efcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large benets over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufcient trafc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple renement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modied to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satised 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satised it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafc through this path for the particular destination prex for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Buttery 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellysh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellysh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subows and modulating how much data is sent over different subows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modications We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafc patterns and show that it signicantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subows 69
