Abstract 
The newly developed Big Data oriented distributed systems such as Apache HBase have been proven effective in storing and analyzing the exponentially growing volume of wide 
variety of data such as sensors data customer generated media web logs and so forth In this paper Apache HBase a distributed scalable big data store is used to store process and analyze a large amount of spatiotemporal data generated by shipboard AIS transponders The objective is to predict the behavior of ships navigating through heavily trafìcked fairways around the gates of busy harbors For that purpose experiments were conducted using tens of gigabytes of real world AIS data The data were processed to form historical ships tracks and were classiìed based on ships attributes such as type draught voyage destination and country of origin Finally a simple algorithm was implemented to predict the target ships behavior based on its 
attributes and movement characteristic As a result an acceptable prediction of ships movement is achieved Furthermore the experimental result also indicated that in the case of data processing speed this technique remarkably outperformed the traditional GIS application software

as well as analyse the data and they need to extract value or meaning from the massive data stream which is continuously growing and has already reached the limit of traditional data processing application This kind of data is currently known as Big Data which refers to tremendous datasets that are challenging to store search share visualize and analyze Currently  Big Data is often deìned to have three characteristics  volume variety and v As an effort to challenge the complexity of Big Data processing new framework of distributed parallel data storage and processing such as Google File System MapReduce and Bigtable have been implemented following the publication of its technical speciìcation by Google At this time the most 
publicly recognized implementation of the framework is the distributed computing software developed by Apache Software Foundation known as Apache Hadoop Hadoop mainly consist of HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System as data storage system and Hadoop MapReduce as data processing framework In addition to MapReduce which is well known of its excellent performance in batch processing Apache has also developed HBase a distributed scalable column oriented database built on top of It is the answer to the need of interacti v e or real-time read/write random-access to the Big Data which is the feature that MapReduce lacks of Many organizations are currently known to have adopted the Apacheês distributed 
system and their success stories have also been world widely published It is reported that by processing and analyzing Big Data using those newly developed technologies new solution for knowledge acquisition and decision making are made possible For companies this surely can lead to greater proìt margin However retrieving value from Big Data is not as simple as revealing new result by merely summing some already known values The value is discovered through a reìning modeling process started from making a hypothesis then followed by creating statistical data visualization or creating semantic models The results are validated then make another hypothesis based on the newly discovered values The 
process may involves a person interpreting visualization or creating interactive knowledge-based queries or a development of machine learning adaptive algorithms that can discover meaning In this paper tens of gigabytes of shipboard Automatic Identiìcation System AIS data are stored and analyzed on Apache HBase operating on top of HDFS The goal is to predict the movement of cargo ships navigating through heavily trafìcked fairways in the vicinity of the gates of busy harbors by merely using the analytical result of the AIS data set AIS is a means for vessels that make it possible to transmit data via radio wave to other vessels as well as to inland stations The 
transmitted information can be divided into three categories 1 Static Information which includes vesselês name International Maritime Organization IMO number Maritime Mobile Service Identity MMSI number and dimension 2 Dynamic Information which contains vesselês position Speed Over Ground SOG Course Over Ground\(COG current status and rate of turn 3 Voyage-speciìc Information which consists of destination Estimated Time of Arrival ETA and The motivation of this research is to offer valuable information for ship operators as well as harbor trafìc administrators

by providing close future estimation of ships behavior The process of analyzing the data was initiated with a hypothesis that the ships movement behavior that form its tracks is determined by several parameters such as course speed draft type time season country of origin and voyage destination of the ships Thus it is logically possible to predict any shipês track based on those parameters The next step is determining the HBase table schema to store the AIS dataset on HBase The schema needs to be designed in such a way that statistical data can be retrieved effectively as the performance of HBase is greatly inîuenced by the table Then statistical data and visualization are created based on the parameters that determine the ships tracks Base on this statistical data as well as the visualization and by implementing a simple algorithm the future position of target ships were predicted The results are then validated through repeated experiments As a conclusion an acceptable prediction of ships movement behaviour is practical to achieve by this method The contributions of this paper are as follows 1 Ship movement behaviour is predicted by implementing the developed simple algorithms on large data set of real-world AIS data stored and processed on Apache HBase 2 A nding which emphasize that HBase is obviously faster than the traditional desktop application in the case of processing large data set The experiment section of this paper explain that HBase performed much better than the MarineCadastre.Govês TrackBuilder embedded on ESRI ArcGIS in the process of generating historical ships tracks to visualize the AIS data set The remaining of this paper is organized as follows Section II discusses several related works on distributed parallel processing using Hadoop and HBase as well as several researches on ship motion prediction using AIS data In section III the details of the proposed method is presented Following this the result of the experiment based on the method is provided in section IV Finally the conclusion and the future work of this paper are stated in section V II R ELATED W ORKS Distributed system has been a common method in processing and analyzing large data set especially after Apache Software Foundation introduced as an open source implementation of Google File System GFS and  In 6 K onstantin Shv achk o et al described the architecture of HDFS and report their experience on managing 25 petabytes of enterprise data at Yahoo using Hadoop The data were stored and processed on Hadoop clusters which span 25000 servers with the largest cluster being 3500 servers They found the scalability advantage of Hadoop and recommended that managing multiple clusters is more prudent than a single large one Having recognized of its scalability fault tolerance and its simple programming model many researches on processing massive spatial data using Hadoop were conducted by researchers of academic institutions as well as professionals of enterprise research centers In Ariel Cary proposed a scalable solution for building R-tree indexes on large spatial databases using the MapReduce parallel programming model His paper stated that R-tree construction times were significantly lowered with the parallel approach which achieved close to linear scalability as more nodes were used in index construction task To examine the possibility of using parallel distributed system on processing Geographic Information System GIS data Nathan Thomas Kerr conducted a research on parallel GIS processing using Hadoop and Message Passing Interface MPI He concluded that parallel GIS processing is possible and can afford signiìcant decrease in processing time while using simple algorithms in cases where one or more datasets must be processed in their entirety Furthermore in  Shubin Zhang et al proposed an algorithm called Spatial Join with MapReduce\(SJMR He compared the performance of his newly developed algorithm with the traditional Parallel Partition Based Spatial-Merge join PPBSM and concluded that SJMR outperformed PPBSM So far Hadoop with its beneìcial features was proven feasible to be used in processing large data set including spatial data However MapReduce as the core of Hadoop data processing framework was not designed to handle interactive or real time read/write random-access to the assigned data sets For this matter in Abhisek Sagar proposed Hadoop-withDatabase HadoopDB which takes Database Management System DBMS as the storage and MapReduce mechanism for parallelization As a complement to Hadoop which is lacked of interactive data processing feature Apache has developed HBase  as an open source implementation of Google  HBase is the answer when real time read/write random-access to very large datasets is A research on using HBase to process multidimensional data was conducted by Shoji who proposed an e xtension of HBase called MD-HBase The proposed system provides an effective range searching for multi-dimensional data without sacriìcing the scalability feature of HBase Another research was carried out by Gimadeev Sergey who presented a method and algorithms for optimizing access to spatial data in HBase  The method uses quad-tree inde xing to inde x the spatial data objects for further processing In year 2000 the International Maritime Organization IMO adopted a requirement for all ships to be equipped with AIS capable of providing information about the ship to other ships as well as to coastal authorities automatically The requirement then became effective for all ships by 31 December Since then the spatiotemporal data generated by the shipboard AIS transponders has become a common subject of researches on the eld of maritime studies The researches were mainly carried out on a purpose of discovering new values from the abundant availability of spatiotemporal data which are continuously generated The method used on this purpose can be statistical model as well as data mining techniques In B Ristic et al proposed a method of anomaly detection and motion prediction by conducting statistical analysis of motion patterns in AIS data It used AIS dataset collected over a period of three months to generate vessels trajectories Based on the trajectories vessel motion patterns were extracted which were used to perform anomaly detection and motion prediction The motion prediction was conducted using the Gaussian sum tracking lter under an assumption that no anomaly exist However the paper does not provide numerical data presenting the extend of validity and effectiveness of

the proposed method Another research on vessels trajectories generated from AIS data was conducted by Premalatha  His paper presented an optimization method of raw AIS data with a purpose to conduct trajectory analysis in order to identify the characteristics of vessels in New Zealand waterways The proposed method was executed to generate the velocity proìle of three types of vessel which were High Speed Craft Passenger Vessel and Ferry and to create visualization of ship trajectories In the term of safety in maritime environment Trika Pitana et al proposed a hazard navigation map using AIS in which the information from ship database such as the length and type of ship is combined with AIS data to determine the dangerous when the ship is underw ay  The resulting dangerous score is then combined with GIS to develop hazard navigation map Following this research a more realistic dynamic navigation hazard map was proposed in by combining relatively static data of Electronic Navigational Chart ENC and the dynamic AIS data III P ROPOSED M ETHOD According to the previous works on distributed system mentioned in section II it is feasible to accelerate the performance of processing large sized spatial data by implementing distributed system such as Hadoop and HBase On the other hand the results of researches on AIS data indicated that it is possible to estimate the movement of vessels based on its moving patterns extracted from historical vessels trajectories Thus an attempt to predict the moving behaviour of vessels using large dataset of AIS data processed on HBase is a convincing idea This paper was initiated by a hypothesis that any vessels navigating through fairways on its way to enter or leave a harbor must follow a certain moving pattern base on its attributes and characteristics Vessels having exactly the same or similar attributes and characteristics are likely to follow similar moving pattern The vessel attributes and characteristics that are used as the parameters for determining vessels moving pattern and predicting its future position are retrieved from AIS data as follows 1 Current location This parameter is needed to gather the k nearest neighbors kNN of the target ships which will be used to determine its moving pattern 2 Course and speed These are selected under a logical assumption that ships having the same course and speed are likely to reach the same location in a certain period of time 3 Vessel Type This parameter is selected base on real world observation that passenger ships generally have different route from tankers or cargo ships 4 Draft Vessels are constrained by her draft when making way through waterways In order to navigate safely sufìcient depth must be taken into account so that vessel with different draft will need different depth to be considered as navigable waters 5 Destination It is logical that vessel with different destination will navigate through different route However in AIS data the destination information is provided by shipês operator which means the information is prone to error caused by misspell wrong abbreviation or just because the operator forget to update the information 6 Status This parameter indicate the vessel moving status TABLE I B ROADCAST T ABLE TABLE SCHEMA When the required data set is ready the next step is to design the HBase table schema in such a way that it shall surely provide a fast and effective response to spatial queries such as kNN query and vessel trajectories query There are three tables that need to be created namely BroadcastTable VesselTable and VoyageTable BroadcastTable is the main table which hold the AIS data and will answer the incoming queries VesselTable hold only the static information of vessel proìle while VoyageTable containts voyage-speciìc information Both of these table are only needed when constructing or updating the BroadcastTable The schema of the BroadcastTable is as in Table I The combination of vessel type draft status and MMSI is chosen as the row key of the BroadcastTable because it enables an effective response to vessel trajectories query which is a query that request vessel\(s trajectories These trajectories are then visualized by using Java based open source GIS software so that visual analysis of vessels movement pattern is made possible Statistical visualization of vessels trajectories can be generated by customizing the vessel trajectory query with the previously mentioned parameters  is generated from v essel s position coordinate longitude latitude to construct BroadcastTableês column key Geohash is a technique to convert two dimensional location coordinate of longitude and latitude into one dimensional sorted strings similar to Z-order space lling curve The algorithm enables us to execute preìx searching as a simple and effective way to conduct two dimensional range searching

This feature is also applicable in providing fast response to kNN query The main idea of this paper is predicting vessel future position based on the past tracks of vessel of the similar attributes and characteristics Thus the algorithm logic is simply nding the vessels similar to the target ship and assuming that the target vessel will follow the same track as those similar vessels In this paper vessels of type cargo ship are chosen to implement the algorithm Within the type of cargo ship there are 10 subtypes of vessel assigned with different type code The parameter Vessel Type mentioned in this section refers to this type code The prediction algorithm is as follow Convert the target ship location coordinate to Geohash where is the longitude value and is the latitude one Target ship must have destination Scan the BroadcastTable using row key preìx VesselType.Draft.Status as the scanning row key and the target ship location Geohash string as column key The result will be the target ship kNN and all of the neighbors will be ships of the same type similar draft and the same status The kNN algorithm used here is the Geohash based kNN algorithm Select and return only the resulted kNN that fulìll all of the following requirements  1 It has the same destination and the same nationality as the target ship and 2 it has similar course and speed to the target ship Compute the distance between the target ship position and each of the resulted neighbors position  Retrieve the neighbors trajectories from the BroadcastTable Each vessel trajectory is expressed as geometry of type LineString represented in Well Know Text WKT format The LineString consist of geometry of type Point expressed in longitude latitude coordinate The Points that form the LineString are sorted by time with 60 seconds interval The future position of the target ship is calculated using the following formula 1 2 where is the future time is the current time and is the time interval between and  and is the current and the future position of the target ship respectively are the nearest neighbors position at the current time and are their position at time which can be retrieved from its corresponding trajectories At the current position and are longitude and latitude distance between target and each of its neighbors respectively Thus is the vector distance from target ship to each of its neighbors shown in Fig.1 Fig 1 The Prediction Algorithm If the movement prediction results in more than one future positions decide one central position of the prediction by computing all Nearest Neighbors aNN of the predicted future positions Finding the central position predictedPositionList list of future positions predictedPositionList.size mod 2 0 neighborsNum predictedPositionList.size 2 neighborsNum predictedPositionList.size 1 2 predictedPositionList.size 3 each element in predictedPositionList calculate kNN k neighborsNum aNN kNN of all element in predictedPositionList count the appearance of each position in aNN central position position with max count randomly choose either of the predicted future positions as the central position Fig.2 illustrates an example of the algorithm implementation Having calculated the predicted position of the target ship then the accuracy of the prediction can be examined by simply calculating the distance between the targetês real position and the predicted one IV E XPERIMENT In order to examine the validity of the proposed method as well as to evaluate the prediction result real world AIS data were processed on HBase in fully distributed mode The real world AIS data were provided by MarineCadastre.Gov which cover zone 11 of the UTM zoning Fig.3

HBase which is the Hadoop database works on HDFS However it is also deployable on other distributed le system In this experiment HBase is deployed on a Hadoop cluster which consist of 11 Red Hat Linux machines having identical speciìcation Each machine has eight cores of Intel CPU and 24 gigabytes RAM One machine was set up as Namenode and as HMaster The remainding 10 machines were conìgured as Datanodes and as Region Servers Moreover while functioning as datanode and region server three machines were also set up as the ZooKeeper Fig.5 In addition one Windows PC with eight cores of Intel CPU and 16 gigabytes of RAM and a Linux virtual machine with one core of CPU and 4 gigabytes of RAM are set as the HBase client The AIS data provided by MarineCadastre.Gov were in File Geodatabase format which is a proprietary le format of ESRI The ESRI ArcGIS was used to convert the le to Shapeìle As in Section III three HBase tables  VesselTable VoyageTable and BroadcastTable were created to store the AIS data The VesselTable hold vessel attributes which are the static information of the AIS data such as MMSI IMO Number Call Sign Name Type Length Width and Dimension Components MMSI is set as tableês row key and the remainder are set as column keys Table value is the value of each attributes The table stored 5277 of unique vessels The vessels that were

Visualization of vessel tracks was created using two different method The rst method was by querying the BroadcastTable on HBase to retrieve each ship trajectories in WKT format The trajectories do not only contain ship coordinate  location information but also contain the shipês attributes such as MMSI IMO number call sign name type and so forth The second one was by using the AIS TrackBuilder designed for ESRI ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 provided by MarineCadastre.Com AIS TrackBuilder is a tool that work on ESRI ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 to convert a collection of point features into track line and is designed to work with data available from MarineCadastre.gov The software was executed as it is on the Windows PC of the HBase clients The two method were implemented and were compared The result of the comparison is displayed in Table.II it is obvious that the method using HBase showed outstanding performance which signiìcantly outperformed the one using desktop application To generate the track lines of all vessels navigating through the monitored area during July 2009 the rst method took only around 72 seconds to retrieve data from HBase sort the position information by time and embed the vessel attributes to be writen to local storage as WKT le On the other hand the second method took almost 20 times longer than that of the rst one The possible reason are 1 The second method took too much time on reading input data from local storage because the process is constrained by the I/O speed of the disk drive 2 The AIS TrackBuilder application seems to separate the process of building the track lines and embedding the vessel attributes It builds the tracks rst then read vessel attributes from local disk and add it to the generated tracks and nally write the tracks to local storage Whereas the HBase client retrieved the complete AIS information including vessel attributes sort it and just write position information and vessel attributes to local disk Through observation of the visualized vessel trajectories the contribution of the parameters mentioned in Section III in determining vessel moving pattern can be evaluated Based on this visual observation it is clear that the primary parameter which is the spatiotemporal element of the AIS data Fig 6 Track Lines of Danish and Japanese Cargo Ships is compulsory because it is required to visualize the vessel trajectories Meanwhile each of the secondary parameters can be recognized to have a certain rate of contribution in forming the pattern of vessel tracks In this case the nationality parameter is found to have a signiìcant role For example Fig.6 clearly indicates that Japanese cargo ships visited only the Long Beach Harbor while those of from Denmark mostly ended up berthing at Los Angeles Port This means that the cargo ships moving pattern can be generally identiìed by its nationality The movement prediction was conducted as intended by the algorithm in Section III As indicated in the result of visual observation of the visualized cargo ship trajectories the nationality of the cargo ship signiìcantly affected its tracks pattern In order to show the extend of the inîuence of nationality parameter to the pattern of ship movement three movement prediction experiment were conducted 1 Movement prediction with nationality and the other parameters but without draft 2 Movement prediction with draft and the other parameters but without nationality 3 Movement prediction using all of the seven parameters including nationality and draft The result is as indicated by Fig.7 The line chart of the gure displays the prediction accuracy in ten minutes interval to the future from the current time The horizontal axis of the charts shows distance in meters between the predicted position and the target real position Whereas the vertical axis indicates the percentage of the predicted positions that fall within a certain range from the real position The prediction accuracy line graph indicate that there are more predicted positions that fall near to the real position when the ship nationality parameter is used In Fig.7 prediction with nationality parameter resulting about 34 percent of the predicted positions hit the range within 500 meters from the target real position while that of without the nationality parameter generate merely 20 percent In addition to the measurement of the prediction accuracy along with the inîuence of the contributing parameters the time spent for each future position prediction was also measured The result indicated that the time needed to predict

Fig 7 Position Prediction Accuracy 10 minutes from the current time the future position of a certain target ship was varied when it was repeatedly conducted in several different time Those time lapses were measured between 1.2 to 7.5 seconds with an average of 2.4 seconds for predicting one target ship This inconsistency may be caused by the experiment circumstances such as 1 The communication between the clients which send the prediction query to the HBase and the HBase region servers that process and send back the result to the clients is carried out through a Local Area Network of multiple users 2 The machines used in the experiment were not intentionally prepared for this research only It were common machines used by multiple users 3 Apache HBase has a caching functionality that may affect the processing speed In this case the network trafìc condition the machines load and the HBase caching functionality during the time an experiment was conducted may be considered to have contributed to the inconsistency of the prediction time lapses However further research is need to be conducted to examine this hypothesis V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK A simple method of predicting vessel behavior is proposed by utilizing the beneìcial features of Apache HBase in processing large data set To examine the feasibility and the validity of the method experiment using real AIS data of the ships navigating through the waters near to Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbor over a period of two years have been carried out Based on the result of the experiment the proposed method provides two beneìts 1 The method outstandingly outperformed the traditional GIS desktop application in processing massive amount of AIS data to generate vessel trajectories visualization 2 By merely developing and implementing a simple algorithm the method is able to bring an acceptable result in predicting ships movement on a relatively wide area of open sea However there are still a lot of works that need to be accomplished facing the fact that all parameters used in the ship movement prediction are generally treated as having an equal weight Therefore the future work that need to be considered for this research is developing a more advanced algorithm where each parameter used in the prediction is assigned with an appropriate weight so that the accuracy of the prediction can be

   Figure 12 Spectrum for computing models on commodity machines The performance of applications using the traditional computing model suffers from large volume of data retrieval and update By using in-place computing technology the experiment results show that a collaborative planning application can be built to handle big data with acceptable response time using a commodity machine The question left for the readers is whether to trade the traditional approach based on relational databases for such performance gain V C ONCLUSION A real-world collaborative planning application is complex The complexity depends on the number of concurrent participants in the collaboration as well as the data characteristics volume and valence which det ermine the performance of the application The traditional computing model based on databases is inadequate for processing big data with high valence Meanwhile most commonly adopted approaches for big data computing such as Hadoop w e re not des i gned speci  cally for real-time computing and may suffer from performance problems due to large data shuf  ing among multiple servers Instead we take an unconventional approach in-place computing model to address the issues raised by big volume and high valence BigObject is an in-place computing system designed for storing and computing multi-dimensional data It focuses on squeezing i.e scaling in computing performance out of the CPUís of a single machine by trading space complexity with time complexity The general availability of 64-bit architecture makes this possible and triggers revisits to many software areas to rethink alternatives for potential performance leap By building a collaborative planning application based on BigObject we are able to study the behavior of the in-place computing system and evaluate its performance against the traditional approach In the application BigObject demonstrates with signi  cant performance gain and well-organized complexity in both data structure and behavior Our experiment shows that the application takes seconds to compute one hundred millions of data records using one core one CPU and one machine In-place co mputing approach outperforms the approach based on traditional computing model in two orders of magnitude As part of the result from the experiment we have learned the comfort zone for in-place computing Fig 12 shows a spectrum of computing power and the corresponding computing models on todayís commodity machines In-place computing model is capable of delivering computing power between million operations per second mega-operations and billion operations per second giga-operations It is feasible and practical to process data up to one billion of records or low terabytes of raw data within a reasonable timeframe using one commodity machine with multiple cores and multiple CPUís When processing data more than billions of records it will require a distributed approach In-place computing offers an affordable solution for processing data with high valence and volume up to one billion of records R EFERENCES 1 J  D ean and S  G hem a w a t M apr e duce s i m p li  ed data processing on large

time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the matching PigLatin script In the wake of thunderstorm Sandy ravaging New York the third script explores W EATHER D ATA for determining historical weather anomalies In our experiment the script determined all days where both the temperature and wind speed were extreme Experiments were executed for both the full GB of data   GB in and GB in  and a smaller dataset of size GB   GB in and GB in  W EATHER D ATA are distributed based on the year of the records Records from years to were in and the rest were in  Execution times are given in the Figure 8\(c Figures 9\(c and 10\(c again show the execution times for the different parts of the execution in the order in which they occurred As in the previous benchmark the dataîow graph of the weather explorer script consisted of a single MapReduce job WeatherMR for both Rout and PigLatin But in our script we used the operator to join temperature and wind speed inputs instead of the operator Because of this for Rout the scripts could be executed while keeping data GD the distribution of the input data based on the year of its recording allowed to be applied For the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within of the time of the corresponding PigLatin script VI R ELATED W ORK This section describes work related to Rout and Rrun Apache Cascading is another open-source dataîo w engine Cascading consists of a data processing API integration API process planer and process scheduler Like Pig Cascading operates on top of Hadoop in a single datacenter FlumeJava is a statically typed data processing language proposed by Google It is implemented as a Java library A dataîow graph making use of MapReduce jobs for parallelization is generated from a FlumeJava program PQL is another extension of Java recently proposed by Reichenbach et al PQL is a logic-based declarati v e language which facilitates the expression of parallel elements of a computing task with regular Java code being used to deal with the sequential portions The approach supports programmer productivity and allows for aggressive optimizations PQL does not address geo-\ution PLINQ is an e xtension of LINQ 23 for parallel querying of data similar to PQL PLINQ enjoys explicit syntactic support inside NET In contrast to PQL PLINQ is inspired by SQL-style relational queries select statements and is not fully declarative DryadLINQ is an implementation of LINQ for the e x ecution engine None of these languages or their runtime environments currently support setups beyond a single datacenter/cluster Given that all the above-mentioned languages and models revolve around data structures and collections e.g sets maps along with arrays in PQL they are amenable to augmentation with GD data structures Many efforts focus on optimizing dataîow execution instead of dealing with geo-\ution This includes countless optimizations for the MapReduce framework targeting single clusters These are complementary to our work Parcae is a no v el parallel e x ecution en vironment optimized for multiexecutions The solution includes a compiler that creates exible parallel programs a monitor which determines and analyzes resource availability and system performance and an executor which may replace the executing tasks with ones that are better suited for the operating environment Airavat aims at secure analysis of third-party datasets with MapReduce providing strong privacy guarantees in the face of untrusted tasks When combined with a secure inter-datacenter data transfer mechanism solutions such as Airavat can be seamlessly integrated to Rrun to improve the security guarantees of the distributed execution Most commercial databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are designed to handle highly structured data that is available in a single location Many of these databases support multi-region deployments but for high availability and/or fault tolerance Thus they are unsuited for handling GD data Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database solution The back-end of RDS is a relational database deployed in Amazon datacenters RDS supports multi\(availability zone deployments But this is not truly GD since Amazon availability zones are located within a single datacenter Volley is a system for automatically geo-distrib uting data based on the needs of an application presupposing knowledge on the placement of its data client access patterns and locations Based on this information data will be dynamically migrated between datacenters to optimize access times Services like Volley complement a GD dataîow engine but do not replace it Walter is a k e y-v alue storage system that can hold massive amounts of GD data Walter allows transactions and replication of data across

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and efìciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other dataîow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
