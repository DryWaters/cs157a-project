the rising number of applications serving millions of users and dealing with terabytes of data need to a faster processing paradigms. Recently there is growing enthusiasm for the notion of big data analysis. Big data analysis becomes a 
very important aspect for growth productivity, reliability and quality of services \(QoS\cessing of big data using a powerful machine is not efficient solution. So, companies focused on using Hadoop software for big data analysis. This is because Hadoop designed to support parallel and distributed data processing. However, Hadoop has several drawbacks effect on its performance and reliability against big data analysis. In this paper, a new framework is proposed to improve big data analysis and overcome the drawbacks of Hadoop. The proposed framework is called MapReduce Agent Mobility \(MRAM\. MRAM is developed by using mobile agent 
and MapReduce paradigm under Java Agent Development Framework \(JADE 
I I NTRODUCTION The collection of data sets are so large and complex that become difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications Data  The value of big data to an organization falls into two categories: analytical use and enabling new products. Extracting information and something intelligence from these big data sets, commonly

referred to as big data analytics Big data analytics can reveal insights hidden previously by da ta too costly to process such as peer influence among customers, revealed by analyzing 
transactions and social and geographical data.  Big data analytics is shown to be useful in several scenarios analytics enable web data mi ning and enable extracting business intelligence. The primary goal of big data analytics is to help companies to make better business decisions. But analysis of large data sets in real-time requires a framework like MapReduce to distribute the work among tens, hundreds or even thousands of computers. So, many companies 
shoppers 
focused on using Hadoop for big data analysis Hadoop is an open source software framework written in Java by Doug cutting and Michael Cafarella [1   Ha d o o p  enables distributed, data intensive and parallel applications by dividing big data into smaller data blocks. These data blocks are divided into smaller partitions such that each data block processes a different partition in parallel [2  B y  u s in g  Hadoop, there is no limit of storing and processing data by computational technique called MapReduce [3  Ha d o o p  provides a distributed file processing system that stores and processes a large scale of data [4 t  e n ab l e s  a fa u l t to le ra n t  by replicating data on three or more machines to avoid data 
loss [5  bu t  th is  m ethod  cau s es s o m e p r o b l e m s T h e  f i rs t  problem is about increasing th e amount of data that executes on machine by replicating each block of data in two or more machines, and second problem arises when the master machine is failed the full system is down So, in this paper presents a new strategy called MapReduce Agent Mobility \(MRAM to improve big data analysis and overcome the drawbacks of Hadoop. The proposed framework is developed by using mobile agent and MapReduce paradigm under Java Agent Development Framework \(JADE\. JADE is a promising middleware based on the agent paradigm because it supports generic services 
such as communication support, resource discovery, content delivery, data encoding an d agents mobility [6   Indeed, there are seven reasons for using mobile agents as follows 1\ Reduce the network load 2\ Overcome network latency 3\ncapsulate protocols 4\ Execute asynchronously and autonomously 5\ Adapt dynamically 6\ Naturally heterogeneous and robust, and 7\ Fault-tolerant [8   So, the mobile agent is used with Hadoop to overcome the problems faced Hadoop. In the proposed strategy, mobile agents send both code and data to any machine. The machine 
can react dynamically for any changes in the environment Furthermore if a machine or environment down, the mobile agent can migrate to another machine with code and data The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes Hadoop architecture, workflow, and drawbacks Section III presents the basic conc epts of JADE and Mobile Agent. Section IV introduces the proposed framework namely MapReduce Agent Mobility \(MRAM Section V presents a comparative study and performance evaluation of the proposed strategy and Hadoop.

II HADOOP A RCHITECTURE AND WORKFLOW This section presents both the architecture of Hadoop and its workflow for big data analysis as follow Hadoop architecture consists of a Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\ and a programming framework MapReduce. HDFS stores big files across machines in a large cluster. Each file is stored as a sequence of blocks Each block is sent to three or more machines for fault tolerance. Hadoop uses MapReduce method for processing data allocated on each node [9, 10, 11 1 HDFS is a very large distributed file system [12, 13 th a t  is available hardware and provides fault tolerance as well as have high throughput. Many big companies believe that within a few years, more than a half of the world s data will be stored in Hadoop. HDFS stores files as a series of blocks and replicates the data blocks for fault tolerance HDFS is designed to store big data set, and provides global access to files in the cluster. HDFS stores metadata on a dedicated server, called Application data is stored on other servers called All servers are fully connected and communicate with each other using TCPbased protocol [2, 12 HDFS ar ch itecture is broadly divided into following four parts as the follows   to determine the location of data and overseeing overall MapReduce job execution The is responsible of managing all metadata and file system actions It handles the file system namespace operations like open, close, and rename both file and directory Also, it makes all decisions regarding replication of blocks maintains the tree of namespace and maps the file blocks to i.e. the physical location of file data single is considered a bottleneck for handling requests in scientific application environments 9  The stores data in the Hadoop file system Each stores data blocks on behalf of local or remote clients. Each block is saved as a separated file in the node s local file system On startup connects to the and performs a handshake. The purpose of the handshake is to verify the namespace ID and the software version of If does not match the automatically shuts down A  fter the handshake is successful the registers with the  s persistently store their unique storage IDs. The storage ID is an internal identifier of the which makes it as recognizable even if it is restarted with a different IP address or port. The storage ID is assigned to the  when it registers with the on the first time and never changes later The then responds to the requests that coming from the for the file system operations. The s service the read, writing and file replication requests based on the direction from which coming [5  The talks to the to determine the location of the data schedules individual maps reduces or intermediate merging operations to specific machines. It monitors the su ccess and failures of these individual tasks. Also, it works to complete the entire batch job. If a task fail, the will automatically relaunch the task, possibly on a different node, up to a predefined limit of retries [14, 15   The is the master overseeing the overall execution of a MapReduce job. The s manage the execution of individual tasks on each slave node Although there is a single per slave node. Each can spawn multiple Java Virtual Machines JVMs\ to handle many maps or reduces the tasks in parallel The s also transmit heartbeat messages to the usually every a few minutes, to reassure the that is still a live [8, 14   2 In 10 th e f i rst step is th e m ap  jo b w h ich takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data where individual elements are broken down into tuples key/value pairs\ The reduce job then takes the output from a map as input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of pairs. The map function can run independently on each key/value pair, exposing enormous amounts of parallelism Similarly, the reduce function can run independently on each intermediate key, exposing significant parallelism as well Similar to other distributed systems also constitutes a master and a set of workers The master is called  while the workers are called s [11 12  Figure 1 Workflow for Hadoop The workflow of Hadoop is shown in Figure 1. It has the following steps 1\Input text files to a platform 2\Server portioning file to blocks with the same size then assigns a block of data to each computing node

These drawbacks are 1 Hadoop Needs high memory and big storage to apply replication technique 2 Hadoop supports allocation of tasks only and do not have strategy to support scheduling of tasks 3 Still single master which requires care 4 Load time is long These drawbacks effects on both the performance and reliability of Hadoop against big d ata analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new framework or modify some Hadoop features to overcome Hadoop limitations and improve its performance and reliability. So, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of Hadoop and improve big data analysis III B ASIC C ONCEPTS OF JADE AND M OBILE A GENT In the recent years, there are many platforms that can support agent mobility and developing distributed application. JADE is a promising middleware based on the agent paradigm. It supports generic services such as communication support, resource discovery, content delivery, data encoding and so on [6  Th e a r chit ec tu ra l of  JADE contains both the libraries required to develop application agents and the run-time environment that provides the basic services. These services include agent identification and agent communication. The instance of JADE is called and the set of all containers is called platform [7   A mobile agent \(MA\ is a software abstraction that can migrate during execution across a heterogeneous or homogeneous network. It has the ability to suspend its execution according to some factors and resume it in another machine There are several characteristics can be defined the structure of the MA the main characteristic of the MA. It can stop execution on one machine and resume execution on another machine. The state depends on two factors 1. Execution state, which is a runtime state including its program counter and stack 2. Object state, which stores the current values of its variables it is the program code that defines the tasks behaviour. If java is used as MA platform classes present the implementation code. In this manner, there are two ways to make the required classes available to the MA 1. Taking the entire required classes during its itinerary and uses it any time anywhere 2. Taking some of the required classes and once the MA need a class that is not available, it retrieves it from remote location. This operation called technique, and it is a common technique in distributed network systems MA collaborates with other agents to handle the assign job. The Interface is required to make the communication possible between agents  it is a unique ID define agent during its lifetime. It used as a key that needed to refer for a specific agent especially, when it travels all over the network it is the group of addresses created once the MA life start that define the agent journey around the network it is the information of individual, organization or corporation that MA belongs to. Principles are needed to authenticate the MA who dispatched to several destinations on the network  There are many advantages for using mobile agent to solve many problems on distributed application  the cooperation in a distributed system is often achieved using communication protocols. These protocols transfer a large volumes of data stored at remote hosts over the network to a central processing site resulting in high network traffic. At this case, mobile agent uses alternative communication protocols network connections may be fail at any time Agents can solved this problem by perform off-line tasks and send results to server application when it come back online MA can work on top of any operating system with the same its mobility framework Mobile agents react dynamically and autonomously to the changes in their environment If a host is being shut down or platform is down, all agents executing on that machine will be warned and given time to dispatch themselves and continue their operation on another host in the network [17 18    Protocol encapsulation allows the components of distributed system to communicate and coordinate their activities. MAs provide a solution to the problem of upgrading the protocol code at all locations in the distributed system

IV O UR P ROPOSED F RAMEWORK Our proposed framework is called It combines the advantages of both mobile agent, and MapReduce technique The workflow of the proposed MRAM framework is shown in Figure 2. It has the following steps 1 Input text files to the platform 2 Server portioning the file to blocks with the same size 3 Application server assign s a data block to each computing node, but in our approach the server take a task as the other nodes 4 The computing node runs map on the input data and producing intermediate data pair for every word. It then sends its intermediate data pairs to application server directly to perform the reduce operation 5 The reduce operation counts the number of occurrences of each word using the values and emits it as a key-value pair and save the result in file or in consol Figure 2 MRAM Workflow The MRAM framework has several advantages derived from the features of mobile agent and MapReduce technique The advantages of MRAM are 1\Support allocation and scheduling tasks 2\Provides fault tolerance an d don't need high memory or big disk to support it 3\Load time for MRAM is less than that of Hadoop 4\Solve single master \(centralized node\roblem by using features of mobile agent 5\Improve execution time because of no need to huge processing to replication data V C OMPARATIVE S TUDY AND P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS It is noted that MRAM improves reliability of Hadoop using mobile agent and investigate the differences performance of Hadoop and MRAM. The idea of comparative study is applying the same application the same environment on Hadoop and MRAM In this paper, the Measurements have been carried out by using the following hardware and software components. The specifications of the used hardware and software are shown in Table I 1 Hardware contains one server and three nodes namely PC1, PC2 and PC3 connected via a LAN 2 Hadoop and MRAM are the main software components. The word count application is applying on each platform. It is a simple program given a text file and count repeated time for each word, after that save the output as a list in the form of \(<Word Count>\.  It is possible to process each line of a text file completely independently on the other lines The data then is combined in a central location and the results are printed out TABLE I S OFTWARE AND H ARDWARE EQUIPMENTS As mentioned before, there are two weaknesses for Hadoop. The first, still single master which require care. The second, Hadoop reduce the CPU utilization by providing faults tolerance via replication data. Sure, these factors effect on the reliability of Hadoop, so the solution is via mobile agent as in MRAM and will clarify each solution separately as follow The Hadoop is still depend on single node that runs all the services needed to MapReduce task distribution and tracking. There is problem arising when single mode is fails or down causing the fall of the system. For this reason, we used features of mobile agent in our strategy that can react dynamically and autonomously to change in their environment. The idea of solution, the master node is selected when a platform starts working, that build linked list involve meta-data. This meta-data contains all information about the tasks, dependences among them and information

about all machines. After that the master node sends metadata to all machines through the network.  Subsequently, if any node receives a job, this node is elected as a new master node. If a master is shut down or platform is down, all agents executing on master machine will be moved including its code and data to another host that having a highest IPaddress in the network. The agents continue their operation This node becomes as a control node that responsible for all acts of server expect receive result from the machines such as and inform all machines about a machine failed. After all agents finished the executed tasks, it is waiting to send the result to general server when it come back online as shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Solve centralized master node Hadoop reduces CPUs utilizati on by providing faults tolerance via replication data. Mobile agent provides fault tolerance by reacting dynamically and can move with its code and its data, to another machine to continue execute the task, if the framework is down or machine is shut down In Hadoop, each data block is sent to three or more node New strategy is completely different, Figure 4 illustrates the steps to resolve this problem. The main idea is each data block is sent in mobile agent with code to specific machine may be a framework down or machine shut down. In this case the agent react directly to change an environment and move to fastest machine available to continue execute tasks Figure 4 Flow Diagram if node down The idea to evaluate the performance of two platforms via total time takes to complete assign job. The complete job is executed via both Hadoop and MRAM with different size of data. The execution time for each state is calculated. The load time and mapping task for Hadoop is larger than load time for MRAM because Hadoop takes time for replication processing. It means that each task is sent to three or more machines for fault tolerance, but in MRAM the task sent to only one machine and the mobility supports fault tolerance without needing for replication task In experimental study, Hadoop needs thirteen seconds to start to process a task but in MRAM need seven seconds only. Also, the two platforms using the same algorithm map reducing to evaluate execution time. The total time in MRAM is less than that of Hadoop as shown in Figure 5 MRAM gives the possibility for the server or control node to execute task as another nodes in platform, but not exist in tasks or can't work with dependent tasks but MRAM support this feature. Because of this reason, our proposal takes less execution time and high performance more than that of Hadoop Figure 5 Comparison execution time between Hadoop and MRAM Table II illustrates the differences between Hadoop and MRAM through the fetched results from experiments.

VI C ONCLUSION In this paper, a new framework called MRAM is developed using mobile agent and MapReduce paradigm under JADE Our proposed framework is developed to improve big data analysis and to overcome the drawbacks of Hadoop. In the proposed Framework, mobile agents send both code and data to any machine and react dy namically for any changes in environment. In addition, the mobile agents have ability to move with code and data, if the machine or environment is down. Furthermore, Hadoop is still single master which requires care, this problem is solved in MRAM through send met-data contains map of network and all data about tasks and dependences between them. Also, MRAM improves performance by giving the server or control node, the possibility to execute tasks as the others nodes. Another disadvantage of Hadoop, it or does not work with dependent tasks, but MRAM support this feature. A new strategy is written in JAVA programming language based on JADE, This means it can run on different machines and different operating system without any problems R EFERENCES 1 Hadoop web site, http://hadoop.apache.org/, Sep2013 2 Kala Karun.

For example, when the user designates an area of interest, the machine can then detect and track targets \(L1 fusion\ and access contextual information through data mining \(L2/L3 fusion\o enhance understanding \(e.g., target type identification \(ID\d activity Finally, the results are used to query the sensors to get more information \(L4 fusion\, store the results, present to the user \(L5 fusion\ disseminate back to the cloud for mission awareness \(L6 fusion B  Information Management Contextual Tracking In scenario 1 raw \(images, text\ \(tracks, keywords and fused \(tracks with classification and ID labels\are sent to user stations. For the five cases \(1-5\we model data scaled to the relative volume values. We assume that there five distributed operators are maintaining surveillance. The complexity from Case 1 to Case 5 is akin to tracking a few targets \(8 = 40/5\ to that of trying to maintain tracks over the entire context of a city \(200 tracks = 1000/5\. For users, they need information fusion support to track these many targets   Figure 7 \226 Traditional JDL Data Fusion Assuming raw data messaging, it is intuitive that the filtered information can reduce the volu me by ruling out unnecessary data \(see Fig. 7\. The results indicate that from the traditional JDL methods, there is little to no information management from the user, mission, or machine analytics In the second notional scenario we are interested in seeing the benefits of user involvemen t, machine analytics, and information management to support distributed users. Not all users require the same collection information; however they can query the information they need from the cloud to be presented on their displays. In this case, we use a publish/subscribe \(Pub/Sub architecture to afford the interactions of distributed users Using Pub/Sub information management, it is important to note that over a different set of users desiring situational context, with two data feeds \(video to tracks and text to keywords\ 40 to 200 tracks, there is a break point in operations. For this case, if you try and normalize over the time duration of the scenario the fused information accounts to three pieces of information for each image. For the case of two operators, they can follow more objects by specializing in the data source and area of designated interest to highlight tracks. The interesting part is the difference between 5 to 10 operators in that there is an order of magnitude more information being passed around as many users \(assumed\ are requesting the same information The notional Scenario 2 speaks to team management. With too many operators looking at similar data, there could be overlap in functions. Using contextual information and user-defined operating pictures \(UDOP\ displays, information can deliver machine analytic results to th e appropriate user. Each UDOP provides a tailored situational display and the user can call the raw, filtered, or fused data. For this scenario, we compare the filtered and fused data as the user does not want the raw data    Figure 8 \226 Data Fusion with info exploitation   Fig. 8 demonstrates possible needs to extend the JDL model In this case, using information management sends the correct data to the correct user \(by request\r assessment However, using the combination of information fusion and contextual awareness in a pub sub enterprise, only the fused data is going back and forth \226 saving volumes of data transactions.

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
