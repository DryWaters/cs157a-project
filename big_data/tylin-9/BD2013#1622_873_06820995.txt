To overcome the unbalanced flow distribution problem caused by private routing on service overlay network network service providers usually use load balancing strategy but traditional methods do not consider making the load balance adapt to the status of the network, neither consider that load balancing may damage performance of some application links. In order to solve the two problems, based on Wardrop equilibrium theory, the paper proposes a flexible load-balancing traffic grooming strategy, which aims to achieve system optimization 
Abstract 
According to the principle of stochastic user equilibrium, a network traffic optimization control model is proposed. The path impedance calculation formula is given based on the Logit stochastic add-in term, in which the value of the equilibrium parameter   determines the level and scope of load balancing. Finally we designed the elastic traffic grooming algorithm ElaGo. The simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

I I NTRODUCTION 
 SON \(Service Overlay Network  is a kind of virtual Network constructed on the basic IP network. It makes profit through providing high quality data value-added services to users. Due to the separation of infrastructure control from services, it has become an effective approach to achieve crossdomain QoS guarantee. The optimizing resource management for SON also has caused the attention of researchers and network service providers. In order to provide high quality service, SON usually is configured selfish routing, but selfish routing could reduce the network resource utilization, and increase SON providerês investment to capacity expansion 
Wang put forward cooperative game approach between the overlay and underlying layer to solve the selfish routing problems  However, this solution assumes that information of these two layers is opened to each other. Obviously it is conflicted with autonomy and independence characteristics of autonomous system. Therefore, this paper proposed a TE Traffic Engineering\mization strategy in the overlay layer to optimize the overall performance of the system Usually load-balancing method is exploited to minimize the maximum cost of networks. There are many relevant research results for the basic IP network. However, the reported load balancing algorithms are mostly executed in a chosen 
available multipath set. The size of the set is determined with some predefined standard, such as hop count or delay, etc However the selection criteria did not adapt dynamically to network traffic and congestion status. Moreover, the level of load-balancing is hardly adapted to user's QoS requirements In order to solving these problems, an optimizing traffic grooming strategy for SON is proposed in this paper. It focuses on the following two questions

A Wardrop Equilibrium 
R ELATED KNOWLEDGE AND WORK  In 1952, Wardrop proposed the notion of traffic equilibrium for transportation network [3  ccordin g to h i s th eo ry   if travelers are rational, have enough cognition about network and adopt same routing strategy, then the network traffic will eventually reach the user equilibrium. After that, the method is widely used in research of transportation planning. Scholars have proposed a series of extended methodologies forming a complete theoretical system, known as Wardrop equilibrium 
theory, which includes two basic principles: UE \(User Equilibrium\ and SO \(System Optimization\. UE describes the traffic equilibrium pattern that each user non-cooperatively seeks to minimize his journey cost. At equilibrium the journey time in every route actually used is equal and less than those which has not been chosen. Beckmann has put forward a convex programming model that describes the relationship between network traffic and the cost at UE status n oth er prin ciple, SO states other traffic pattern that the sum of journey cost is the minimum at equilibrium. It assumes that the all players choose path under a unified coordination command. If

the network traffic is not too heave and the transportation is unimpeded, UE and SO have the same solution. While with the increasing of the level of congestion, the solution difference between UE and SO will be larger. However, if the participants of UE consider the impact to network performance caused by themselves, that is, Agent using marginal cost as their estimated cost consideratio ns, their routing strategy is minimum marginal cost, the network will reach SO when traffic equilibrium. This method turns the centralized optimization problem into a distributed one and omits the control center of SO planning However, in the practical application of UE model for network traffic distribution, the conditions of UE model could not be met easily due to the estimation of cost function often exist error. It is more consistent with the actual situation to establish model on the network flow with SUE \(Stochastic User Equilibrium  SUE relaxed the hypothesis that the user must know exactly all paths cost. Each Agent always chooses the best path by estimating, and yet paths with higher utility on the whole are selected in greater probability There are two add-in models: Probit and Logit in SUE equilibrium. The Logit SUE model is widely used in traffic distribution study because it is easy to understand. When userês estimation to network impedance estimation is very accurate, the SUE will tend to UE. Literatu ers to more  details about stochastic user equilibrium In recent years, Wardrop equilib rium theory is introduced into research of the communication network traffic engineering and routing optimization. Many meaningful results have been obtained [5In  w h i c h S i m o n con du cted a s e ries of  studies on applying Wardrop equilibrium theory in traffic engineering, especially the feasibility and effectiveness in adaptive traffic distribution. Literatu ploits W ardr o p  routing strategy to avoid traffic jitter and theoretically proved the convergence of the strategy. Then on this basis, the author proposed the Replex algorithm w h ic h elects rou te i n a  multi-next hop route set, and calculates the path cost with the sum of weighted average delay. Replex algorithm was improved in literatu th e paper calcu lates t h e path cost  with queue length instead of the delay, and develop a training algorithm and a smoothing algorithm reducing the influence on the algorithm caused by multiple parameters in the Replex So it was called Non-parametric Regression. Different from Replex, literatu m ed at th e s y s t e m opti m izat ion  It utilized the relationship between the SO and the UE, which UE with marginal cost equivalents to SO, achieve global system optimization by distributed algorithm III M ATHEMATICAL M ODEL  Define the SON network as a directed graph G \(N, A where N is a set of virtual nodes and A is a set of virtual links a 001\031 A. Agent module in each virtual node is responsible for routing decisions. Agents choose routing using impedance as metrics. The path impedance is represented as a single or multiple weighted combinations of QoS metrics, such as delay jitter, reliability and congestion degree, etc. OD \(Origindestination\ pair rs denotes a pair of nodes of ingress to egress in SON is the path set in OD Other variable are as follows traffic demand between OD  traffic on link  average impedance on link  traffic on the path of  OD  pair  if link on the path between  is 1, otherwise 0 According to the model proposed by Backmann, solving the mathematical programming problem \(P1\ get the traffic distribution satisfying UE P1 1 K 2 3 4 The objective function in the mathematical programming has not intuitive economic or physical interpretations.

 and then 7 Formula \(7\plains that if the link impedance is then the corresponding UE problem is turned to SO one. In this paper, we use the SO as flow control target for SON. Agents choose path to transfer packets with the strategy of marginal impedance minimum, therefore the system will tend to SO When the network has no congestion, SO and UE have the same result, and the routing strategy of Agent is equivalent to UE, that is, users are presumed to use the selfish routing strategy. While the network congestion aggravates, the externality of marginal impedance acts. At this time, avoiding congestion will became the main aim of the optimization The SON system optimization model is expressed as \(P3 P3 8 4 We transform model \(P3\o the UE problem by using formula \(7\ccording to the UE principle, if all the Agents choose \(6\ as their routing strategy, the system will tend to equilibrium and achieve UE state in the sense of marginal impedance In this paper, we use delay as impedance. The link impedance is defined as \(9 9 Where is the impedance of network in the spare time called free impedance is effective bandwidth of link is coefficient is the load on the link Its marginal impedance is 10 In order to avoid exhaustive all the paths, a recursive weighted path impedance is defined as \(11  11 Where is a virtual node of SON located between OD pair If the set of all possible next hop nodes from to is To  is a virtual link connecting to and expresses the set of the virtual links is the again hop of The impedance on the path from node r to s via  is defined as the impedance of adding the weighted impedance of paths from to  Because latency on the path has large variance, so the difference is used approximately as the derivative of impedance of a path, and so the path impedance of marginal is expressed as \(12  11 Where is the difference of impedance from to  So, we get conclusion 1: To arbitrary node of SON, if each agent calculates the impedance with the formula \(12\ically, and chooses the path with least impedance to transmit packets, then the system will tend to approximate optimization According to first principle of Wardrop, if the estimation to impedance by agent is very accurate, when traffic is small the load distribution of netw ork will concentrated at some paths with less impedance. Along with the increase of the traffic, impedance will increase gradually; range of load distribution will be enlarged If the impedance estimated by agent has some error, according to SUE, the estimated impedance is expressed the sum of actual impedance and random error term 12 Where and is estimated impedance and actual impedance of path between OD respectively is corresponding error term. The probability of the path selected based on Logit model is as formula \(14

Initialize    The algorithm is set in each virtual node and activated at the end of each information distribution period. The following variables and parameters are also need to be reserved 
13 Where is a parameter. When the variance of all random items tends to zero, SUE turns into UE, and when the probability of selection every path is the same, equal to The traffic on path is expressed as \(15  14 According to this prin ciple, if controlling the we could control the level of load balance. When we increase the value of the impedance of a path will plays the main role to routing decision, and contrarily, when we reduce the value of the role of impedance for routing decision will be reduced Let \(16\e weight of formula \(11 15 In which  is called balance factor. When  That is to say, the influence of each weighted section path exerting on the total path impedance is the same. It is approximate average impedance thus the traffic will naturally distribute on broader range of paths. When the weight of the path with the minimum impedance while all other paths It shows that impedance of the partpath has absolutely influence to the impedance of the whole path. Thus, the traffic will only distribute in the path with the minimum impedance. Obviously, the value can be used as a control factor of the level of traffic distribution, controlling the range of network load balance, and also controlling the influence of impedance on traffic distribution. This method has double meanings: First, let be large enough, UE principle plays the leading role. At lower traffic, the traffic will focus on some paths with little impedance. Along with traffic increases, the impedance of these paths will increase. The flow will distribute to more paths to reduce impedance until balanced. At that time, the impedance of all paths has little difference, so the adaptability to the status of the network and load balance will be naturally established. Second, we can influence the level of load balance by controlling the value when is very small, the flow will be distributed averagely and the efficiency of network will be improved. So, we can control the effect and range of load balance by controlling  Conclusion 2. Using \(16\ as the weight to calculate impedance of paths has: \(1\e system will tend to stochastic user equilibrium in the sense of marginal impedance, called random system optimization, and \(2\he can influence the range and level of the load balance. Therefore, we use as parameter of load balance controller IV A LGORITHM  We designed DyGo\(Elasticity Load balance traffic Grooming\gorithm running on virtual nodes of SON.

It is a small real number, in order to avoid algorithm error when the flow is close to capacity V as start. Packets are exchanged by UDP among the virtual nodes The experiment tests the influence on load distribution from the increase of traffic. There are 25 virtual nodes in the SON, in which the number of ingress \(egress\ is 4, and the number of internal node is 21. The nodes are all connected each other. We assume that the capacity of each link is 1M bytes. Two ingresses \(egresses\ are connected two groups of data resource and user groups respectively. The data resource generates continually random CBR flow to the network. When the experiment starts, every ingress node is connected to 10 data sources, and after that, in every 50ms, a data source is added to the ingresses. In a control period, the traffic tends to equilibrium. In the experiment we observe the influence of load distribution from the increase of flow. In theory when SUE turns to UE, however in many experiments, we find that when the influence of random distribution aroused by error term is very small. It is similar to results of UE, therefore is taken as selfish routing in the experiment. Similarly, when load tends to average distribution. However, we found that when the average delay of network can significantly increase. On balance is taken as loose routing strategy. The experimental results are shown in figure 1 NoControlé indicates no flow control on overlay layer. Four minimal hop paths are chosen by the IP layer routing. The distribution does not change when increasing traffic. When the range of load distributed is the widest. When the load distribution is the most sensitive for increasing flow. The experiments illustrate that DyGo makes load distribution adaptive to traffic changing better              In the experiment, we test performance of the algorithm by observing the average throughput of network The bottom topological structure contains 100 nodes. We choose virtual nodes from the 100 nodes in 15% probability All virtual nodes are full connection each other and 5% the connection between the nodes are deleted randomly. The number of ingress \(egress\ is 4. The ingress nodes import CBR flows continuously. The simulation results are shown in figure 2. The measuring cycle T is 50s. It can be easily seen from fig.2 that when and the average throughput of TCP is higher than that without DyGo\(No Control The experiment also showed that is a more suitable choice when trading off the average delay and throughput          The experiment tests the effect of load balance when the changes of demand are beyond expectation. When real-time traffic deviate expected demand, the performance of network could be deteriorated with static traffic engineering algorithm. In order to solve this problem, an improved OSPFTE, called OSPF-TE-Multi algorithm  divides the control periods into the peak, slack period and so on, and distributes load according the weights of every period. For the purpose of testing the dynamic adaptive of the algorithm, we performed the comparative experiment on the response to the change of traffic demand among the algorithm proposed in this paper the OSPF-TE and OSPF-TE-Multi algorithm. The experiment adopts CAIS  topological structure and sliding window flow prediction method to measure flow demand. The result is shown as figure 3. The x axis represents deviation value. For example, the deviation value 1.5 stands for that actual traffic is selected randomly within 50% of the range of the prediction. We test the performance of load balance of above three algorithms with deviated traffic demand environment so as to compare the dynamic adaptability of the algorithm. The optimization goal is link utilization maximize. There are 44 periods in the experiment. In figure 3, OSPF-TE and OSPF-TEMulti mean that IP layer was set OSPF-TE and OSPF-TEMulti protocol respectively with utilization as parameter and no flow controlling in covering level. The DyGo means that physical layer was set OSPF protocol with hop number as parameter, DyGo algorithm in co vering layer and 1as equilibrium coefficient. The results show that when the predicted deviation increases, the performance of the covering layer that implemented the algorithm of this paper is the best, the performance of OSPF-TE is the lowest, and the performance of OSPF-TE-Multi protocol is better than that of OSPF-TE.

The best speed  can  then be used to determine viability  en-US A  The best speed  en-US The main experiment quantitatively showed that of the three speeds tested, there was a significant drop in accuracy for only the fastest speed   1 s \(24   when compared to the other speeds   en-US For the 2 s \(12◊\ & 5s \(4.8◊\ speeds there was no significant difference in accuracy among the participants  This means the re  is no significant drawback  in accuracy  for tasking participants to operate at a 2s speed over 5s  en-US Additionally the miss rate for participants at speeds 2s and 5s were 5 and 1 respectively  For the 1s speed this rate jumped to 14  These misses were  partially explained by a single  participant th at declined to answer  for negative flashcards for the 1s speed only   that account ed  for 0.8% of  flashcards  en-US B  Hit distributions  en-US The hit distribution data   F ig   3 provides insight into when in the exposure period users were  responding   en-US T he median responses for all three experimental speeds were  between 500ms  and 800ms    approximately what the literature suggested it should be  As the speed increased  the median hit time decreases We speculate that the increased speed is forcing th e participants to lower their average reaction time  en-US When the  tails of hit distributions  were compared   we see that f or  speed 1, at its  upper bound, the histogram shows a non zero value of 2.5 This  mean t  that on average a group of participants was  not responding within the time constraint. For the 2s  and 5s speeds, the histograms demonstrate a more relaxed tail of diminishing responses The last data point for 2s is at 0.002% of hits and the 5s speed actually hits zero   indicating all users had finished responding within the time constraints The difference in completion of hits within the allotted time between 2s and 5s was  negligible  0.002 This means, that the extra three second s of time between the speeds is wasted given all responses can be accounted for without the extra time  en-US Finally the red line on the hit distribution graph represents the upper  bound of human reaction time performance  200ms  Discussed in the related wor k section, it is extremely unlikely to see a legitimate response within the first 200ms of exposure of a flashcard We speculate any hits that occur within this 200ms period are invalid either caused by panic or delayed  reactions   i.e. a participant  dec ided  how to classify a card too late  and accidently responded  to the next flashcard in the sequence   With the 2s and 5s speeds only a very small percentage of hits occur red  within this first 200ms 0.5% for 5s and 2% for 2s \(cumulative where t < 200ms\. H owever, for the 1s speed the cumulative hits reach ed  8  t  200ms  This means, of the 2530 flashcards shown there were 202 r esponses for  which it is impossible for them to be legitimate   en-US Tying the miss rate \(14%\in with the impossible response time rat e \(8%\for the 1s speed    rate for speed 1   much higher than speeds 5  or 2  1.5% & 7  minimum error rates  respectively    en-US C  Survey data  en-US The qualitative  data  received from the survey produced a wide range of results Gender was roughly split a ge  was en-US TABLE VI  A GE AND V OCATION B REAKDOWN  en-US Age  en-US Percentage  en-US  en-US Qualifications  en-US Response  en-US 18  en-US 0.00  en-US  en-US High School Diploma  en-US 28.77  en-US 18  25  en-US 41.10  en-US  en-US TAFE Diploma  en-US 15.07  en-US 25  35  en-US 24.66  en-US  en-US Graduate Degree  en-US 28.77  en-US 35  45  en-US 12.33  en-US  en-US Post graduate degree  en-US 24.66  en-US 45  55  en-US 9.59  en-US  en-US Post doctoral qualifications  en-US 2.74  en-US 55  65  en-US 9.59  en-US  en-US  en-US 65  en-US 2.74  en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 4  Preferred speed from the experiment  and desired speed for long amounts of work  en-US  en-US 0 en-US 20 en-US 40 en-US 60 en-US 80 5 3 2 1.5 1 1 faster slower Percentage of respondants Speed Desired Speed Experiment Speed 


en-US skewed towards the 18 25 bracket, and vocation was roughly  evenly  distributed Importantly, 45% of respondents indicated they do not recreationally look for wildli fe This means a reasonable number  of novices participated in the experiment  Novices completing this experiment is ideal, as it is desirable for the rapid scan methodology to show good results for any skill level, not just for experts  en-US Comments on the des ign and layout of the experiment were noteworthy and will be addressed in future iterations of the experiment However, ultimately, the most important responses were the speed preferences Of the speeds tested 70 of respondents indicated they preferred t he 2s speed wi th associated comments indicating  5s was boring, and 1s stressful When asked about their preferred hypothetical speed respondents answered most commonly with a range between 1.5s and 3s. Common requests included variable speeds  to suit thei r preference and ability    which would be ideal outside of  an experimental environment  en-US D  Viability  en-US Given that the 2s speed was  the best option of the speeds tested, it would be the ideal speed to use  in a production scale  flashcard analysis s ystem    en-US At the 2s speed   accu racy compared to real time is 83   Provided the requirements for rapid scan methodology are met see  the  en-US Limitations en-US  section  we argue that a 17  drop in accuracy is an acceptable trade off  for a 12 an order of magnitude increase in analysis speed   For Koala vocalizations  in particular, they often last 20 60 seconds, fading in, reaching a climax, and then fading out. This long call means as many as 5 flashcards could have instances of the one group of vocalizations    positive identification  is only necessary for one of the flashcards shown wit hin the vocalization  period  en-US VI  C ONCLUSION  en-US The experiment indicated the viability of rapidly scanning spectrograms for the basic identification of Koala vocalizations   A 12   2.0s exposure\ speedup is achievable with an acceptable trade off in accuracy  17   en-US Future work on the rapid scan methodology includes enhanced development of the interface  integration with our production  website, and subsequent testing with different forms of analysis  Subsequent experimental tests could includ e  testing   different species different times of the day variable  exposure durations noise reduced spectrograms spectrogram compression  length variation and different numbers of classifications per flashcard   en-US Additionally  we think  further study into  the concep t of a  double run analysis  of a dataset  is worthwhile  By analyzing each dataset twice with a rapid scan methodology  it might be possible to decrease the drop in accuracy significantly for  a trade off of half the effective speed  en-US Despite the results even  when processing audio data at 12   speed, any substantial data analysis is still time consuming for a participant   We think the rapid scan methodology will be most useful when combined with multiple analysis techniques. Such techniques  could  include  automa tic filtering of the data natural  integration with our current analysis  system   and some form of sampling methodology \(either random or smart  en-US R EFERENCES  en-US 1  J Haselmayer and J S Quinn A comparison of point counts and sound recording as bird survey methods in Amazonian southeast Peru The Condor vol. 102, pp. 887 893, 2000  en-US 2  M.

Threshold observe that the number of frequent subgraphs rst increases exponentially and then increases smoothly after an inîection point emerges This is because frequent subgraphs with smaller size tend to have many extensions that are then able to be veriìed as frequent subgraphs as well Nevertheless frequent subgraphs with larger size may not have many valid extensions with respect to the frequency threshold The position of the inîection point relies on the frequency threshold Generally a small frequency threshold leads to a larger inîection point Another interesting nding is that the number of frequent subgraphs drops superlinearly when we enlarge the frequency threshold Not surprisingly the size of their posting lists shown in Figure 10\(b follows the same trends to that of the number of frequent subgraphs The running time and the I/O cost for both MRFSE-J and MRFSE-E follow the same trends When reducing the frequency threshold we can nd that the running time in MRFSE-J increases more signiìcantly than that in MRFSE-E while the I/O cost is the exact opposite VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we studied the problem of efìciently supporting frequent subgraphs extraction in a distributed environment particularly using the MapReduce framework We presented a framework called MRFSE to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs on a MapReduce like platform such as Hadoop We introduced a equal size partitioning strategy in order to balance the workload We proposed an isomorphismtesting-free approach for generating new subgraphs by properly maintaining how frequent subgraphs are mapped within each graph Extensive experiments conducted on our in-house clusters demonstrate that the techniques built using proposed framework are scalable and efìcient A

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
