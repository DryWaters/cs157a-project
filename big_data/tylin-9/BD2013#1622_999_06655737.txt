The sharing of large and interesting Big Data in cloud environments can be achieved using data-as-a-service where a provider offers data to interested users In  the data provider also supplies compute infrastructure allowing users to run analytics tasks local to the data and reducing the expensive and slow transmission of data over networks This paper describes a services-based ecosystem 
Abstract enhanced data-as-a-service 
that allows providers to precisely share portions of their data with users using a model where users submit MapReduce jobs that run on the providerês Hadoop infrastructure Providers are given mechanisms to lter segment and/or transform data before it reaches the userês task The ecosystem also allows for intermediaries who offer value-added ltrations segmentations or transformations of the data for example pre-ìltering a dataset to only include high-income users We describe the RESTful services required to enable this ecosystem introduce a prototype to demonstrate the concept and present experiments using this ecosystem to both provide and analyze different segments of a single large data set Index Terms 
Big Data service system RESTful services data-as-a-service 
I I NTRODUCTION As data is generated in larger volumes interest is growing in determining how best to process and extract useful actionable knowledge from large data sets This so-called is important to many domains including biological and life sciences 2 the physical sciences 3 and digital humanities One approach to distributed large-scale data processing is MapReduce often in the implementation included in the Hadoop 1 system Although Hadoop and the MapReduce paradigm offer users substantial power there is an investment 
Big Data 
of both time and capital to create a Hadoop infrastructure Acquiring computation resources installing Hadoop loading transmitting and managing large scale data and navigating the data storage options Hadoop le system HBase Amazon S3 all require technical ability beyond the skills needed to author MapReduce jobs Some elements of this complexity are addressed by cloud services using a cloud-based Hadoop infrastructure e.g Amazon Elastic MapReduce or a tool to simplify installation e.g Cloudera can streamline some parts of the process but only for users with a strong understanding of Hadoop In previous work we introduced an approach to precision segmented sharing of Big Data in a cloud environment while ensuring compliance with the information and privacy 
policies of the sharing organization A user submits a MapReduce job to the provider to be executed this jobês access to 1 http://hadoop.apache.org data is overseen by a series of 
modifying maps resellers 
that can lter and transform data before it reaches the userês job The original data provider may lter out private information or transform data from a proprietary format to one more usable Various other data may lter data to produce restricted subsets that are made available at reduced cost or simply to reduce computation by pre-ìltering data not relevant to the user All data processing occurs on the providerês infrastructure 
as a service with only the results transmitted to the user In addition to the security and privacy beneìts there is a substantial improvement in usability as signiìcant technical complexity is assumed by the provider reducing the technical knowledge required We call this set of participants and their interactions the 
DaaSPatcher ecosystem 
 It is enabled by a suite of services implemented by each participant in compliance with a set of speciìcations These standardized RESTful services enable loose coupling and runtime composition allowing users to submit sophisticated data processing jobs to providers and resellers without systems integration effort The ecosystem includes a marketplace that provides a straightforward interface 
for non-technical users to nd and launch MapReduce jobs on available datasets In contrast to previous work which focused on the providerês data segmentation and privacy aspects of this data-sharing model this paper describes the services that enable the userfacing portions of the ecosystem We discuss the requirements of these services the service speciìcations each participant must comply with and our implementation of these speciìcations in a functional prototype implementation We use the illustration of a data provider offering access to a set of past tweets from Twitter and various resellers offering at lower cost subsets of that data only tweets in English only tweets from popular users etc Of particular interest is the ability to compose multiple resellers at run-time for 
example composing a reseller removing non-English tweets with one removing unpopular users would create a new dataset English tweets from popular users without requiring a second copy of the data without requiring human intervention and without requiring a provider or reseller to explicitly offer such a dataset We begin by describing the data sharing ecosystem in more detail in II then describe the services each participant in the ecosystem must implement III We introduce our proofof-concept implementation and demonstrate it using a Twitter dataset IV before offering thoughts on future directions V and the relationship to related work VI Finally we

conclude the paper in VII II T HE D AA SP ATCHER E COSYSTEM Our approach allo ws to run MapReduce MR jobs on some portion of a s Big Data while affording the data provider total ne-grained control over access to each piece of data and allowing run-time transformation of the data can act as intermediaries in the interaction offering their own value-added transformations or subsets of the providerês data before it is processed by the userês MapReduce job These various modiìcations of an original data set are referred to as  This run-time mediation is provided by preìxing the userês MapReduce job with an additional Map step a Map-MapReduce job where the provider can implement access control data segmentation and/or data transformation This can also control the userês Map task at a low-level including measuring or limiting execution time The analytics user is one interested in performing analytics tasks on largescale data in the cloud a task of signiìcant interest 8 perhaps for providing services to end users Conceptually  the provider and reseller maps mediate the userês MapReduce access to data Fig 1a A data provider may choose to delegate the actual processing to an  which stores a copy of the data on an infrastructure separate from the data providerês production environment but updates with sufìcient frequency to be considered perpetually current For example Twitter has delegated most public access of all Tweets to three certiìed providers 2  A data provider may also keep such a copy inhouse or it may be acceptable to allow outside access to a single copy of the data Weêll use the term to refer to an entity responsible for accepting and running MapReduce jobs regardless of the actual ownership of the data The data provider identiìes the data sources they wish to provide and implements a Modifying Map to enforce their information policies access control to offer different views on the same data transformation and to offer valuable selective subsets of the data segmentation They then provide a RESTful API to accept incoming jobs to run on those data sources The analytics user submits their compiled code to the providerês web service along with any required parameters They monitor the status of their job or retrieve the results through the same web service The user can run their own client for communicating with the web service or use a client offered through a Software-as-a-Service SaaS delivery model where they submit and monitor jobs through a user interface with the actual communication handled behind-thescenes A offers further segmentations or transformations of the data set They may establish relationships with providers and sell access to the providerês infrastructure accepting MR jobs from users and running them on the provider A 2 https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certiìed-products/products reseller could offer additional segmentation or transformation to produce value-added data sets or smaller more affordable data sets In the Twitter example one reseller might segment Tweets by estimated household income based on geographic information another might augment Tweets with a popularity metric a third might sell subsets of the overall data set where only Tweets mentioning politics or certain products are included An analytics user could choose one of these smaller data sets to reduce costs Resellers can be chained together in theoretically unlimited series for example a fourth reseller might sell segmented access to the rst resellerês Tweet+Income data set by income tax bracket To achieve this second and third and th layer of runtime data mediation resellers add their own Modifying Maps between the providerês Modifying Map and the userês Map Because the data provider is the sole arbiter of which data is passed to the reseller and the reseller then decides which data is sent to the user each participant retains the control they need If any provider or reseller determines the consumer of their service should not have access to a given data record the Map code is never invoked on that data record Each invocation may transform the data from the original key-value pair provided to the providerês map method A reseller offers the same API as all the providers allowing resellers to be easily composed with providers and other resellers Incoming compiled Map code is augmented with the resellerês Modifying Map then passed to the next reseller in the chain or the provider via their API Requests for status updates or results are similarly passed on and the result returned to the requester There is also the option of including  which host their own infrastructure acquire data from multiple providers and run MR jobs directly on their infrastructure where this data is aggregated ltered or otherwise combined and transformed In essence they act as both a provider and a reseller Managing these multiple roles is the responsibility of the reseller throughout this text when we refer to providers we include Enhanced Resellers when in their provider role and likewise for reseller and user roles Finally using a marketplace users can discover available data sources and submit jobs to them easily and providers can authorize users to run MR jobs without knowing all of the details about the user or having an established relationship This is enabled by Attribute-based Access Control ABAC as described in In an open data en vironment the AB A C mechanisms can be omitted III E COSYSTEM S ERVICES The DaaSPatcher ecosystem includes several participants each implementing a RESTful service that complies with the given service speciìcation How these services may be composed and how the service interactions relate to the conceptual lters is shown in Fig

The data or infrastructure provider offers mechanisms to discover available datasets to submit and track jobs submitted to retrieve the results from completed jobs and to view the status of the server All service responses are sent in JSON unless otherwise speciìed and the WADL included in the speciìcation is made available to clients No requirement is expressed regarding the implementation and additional services may be included in the implementation the required resources are the following  This resource lists all available data sources with metadata about each resource in the form of a JSON array of JSON objects Each object includes the unique name of the data source a name must be unique to the provider but not globally unique the interface that client code must implement when deìning their Map step and the package this implementation must belong to a plain-text description of the data source and the price of running jobs Prices may be expressed as a xed rate per CPU-hour or per GB Optionally the provider may include the total size of the dataset and a pointer to a data source with a subset of the data for free testing of MapReduce jobs To enable ABAC protection the provider must also include a set of attributes they require users 4 will be used to submit to verify their identity and their permission to access the data These attributes come from various authorities and are signed to verify authenticity For example a provider might require the attribute  the userês age from the authority Facebook which the provider might user to lter out users under the age of 13 Optionally the provider may specify a similar set of attributes that the marketplace requires and veriìes before providing access to metadata about the data source 4 Throughout this section we use submitter to refer to whichever entity is submitting a request to the given service recall that this may be the analytics user or the reseller When user is used it refers speciìcally to the analytics user  The job submission endpoint expects a le upload containing the MapReduce code to run including a class in the package speciìed implementing the interface speciìed by the provider It is expected the le is typically a jar le and the provider must at minimum accept jar les but this is not an explicit restriction It also requires three parameters  the submitterês unique identiìer for the job  the submitterês Reduce class and  the provider-assigned name for the datasource on which to run this job The provider is responsible for accepting and processing the uploaded le including injecting its own Modifying Map around the Map task and submitting the job to its Hadoop infrastructure It must retain an association between the Hadoop job and the submitter-assigned job name in order to handle subsequent requests from the submitter referring to the job The response in the event of a successful submission is an HTTP status of 200 with the content a simple JSON object with set to the value of the job name In the event of an error an HTTP status of 400 various submitter input errors 500 server error or 401 permissions error will be returned along with explanatory text  For the given in the URI this endpoint returns the basic status of the job as a JSON object with one key  with the value one of PENDING EXECUTING COMPLETE or FAILED A pending job has not yet been submitted to Hadoop an executing job is currently running on Hadoop a complete job has been successfully run on Hadoop and a failed job has encountered an error from which no recovery is possible and the job should be submitted In the event of an error an appropriate HTTP status code and explanatory message will be returned 400 for a missing or invalid jobname 404 when the jobname does not exist 500 for server errors 401 for permissions errors  Given the  this service returns information about the job in HTML format for display Is is intended to offer features similar to the Hadoop job tracker which allows submitters to track the

progress of their job percent complete resources used etc The exact information supplied is up to the provider It is not permitted to request this resource for a job with the status PENDING The tracker is expected to offer more information describing the failure for jobs with status FAILED Errors will be HTTP status codes and explanatory text similar to the endpoint  Once a job reaches the COMPLETE status it is valid to request this resource Prematurely requesting this service or errors on user input will produce errors similar to the previous services The result of a successful request will typically be of type  though if an alternate type is obvious given the data source the alternate is permitted The response may be very large depending on the job submitted  This resource returns the status of the server in JSON format with the key and a value of HEALTHY AILING or CLOSED required Optional keys are for more information for the estimated queue time for the current load of the server and to identify the next scheduled down time Submitting jobs to a CLOSED service is not permitted and to an AILING service is discouraged The provider determines in what circumstances their server is AILING The reseller provides the same services as a provider though the requirements of the implementation are slightly different The reseller is an intermediate service in a composition in contrast to the user and provider who are by deìnition at the beginning and end of the composition The reseller receives inbound requests from submitters invokes the next service in the composition and retrieves a response then returns a response to the submitter  As for providers available data sources offered by the provider with all associated metadata are provided here in the same format The key difference is internally the reseller must maintain an association between the data sources they offer and which data source they are transforming  segmenting  ltering that is the next reseller or provider in any composition  Like the provider the reseller accepts the uploaded code checks it for compliance with the speciìcation and then injects their own Modifying Map They may create a new  for example by preìxing the submitterês with the user ID of the submitter They pass on the submitterês Reduce class without modiìcation Finally they use their map of incoming data source names to which reseller/provider the job should now be submitted  The must be mapped to the next reseller/provider in the composition  a request sent to that entitty with a modiìed if required and the response returned to the submitter As each reseller in the composition will pass on the request ultimately the response will be provided by the provider  For the reseller a parameter is required for this request and the contents of this resource from the next reseller/provider in the composition for that data source is returned A marketplace may provide many services and integrate with other APIs and services as needed here we focus on those required to establish an ecosystem Some services e.g user login  A provider deìning a new datasource must register their endpoint URI with the marketplace The minimum requirement is the URI other optional parameters may be included such as the requirements of the marketplace on revenue sharing This service is not rigorously speciìed as it is not required for runtime composition a trust relationship must be established which may build on existing approaches to the automated establishment of trust or be established ofîine  Authorities for the ABAC approach to managing access rights register using this service Again ofîine trust establishment is required as each authority provides their own API and they are not subject to these speciìcations the mechanisms for verifying information acquired from an authority are not described here in detail IV I MPLEMENTATION D EMONSTRATION As a proof of feasibility we implemented the speciìcation given in III to create the DaaSPatcher ecosystem This implementation goes beyond the implementation described previously with a ne w moti v ating e xample and set of experiments In this implementation we consider a single provider with a repository of tweets to which they wish to provide access Users are typically not interested in the entire data set and may not have the resources to purchase store or process that volume of data By providing access to segmented portions the provider expands their user base they delegate the details of this task to resellers who can imagine many different lters This allows the provider to focus on their core competencies gathering tweets and allows them to delegate the imagining of interesting lters to resellers The users gain access to a resource that would otherwise not be accessible to them without requiring up-front investment in infrastructure and with faster processing time than processing the entire data set We implemented the providerês services according to the given speciìcations using the PHP Slim Framework 5  The results of the command are shown in Figure 1 Applications using this framework list the REST resources they offer and deìne a to process 5 http://www.slimframework.com

helping to assure academic integrity For data sources with high usage it is feasible for the provider to maintain a Hadoop installation and use the revenue from frequent requests to cover the expense of this infrastructure If jobs are infrequent or not intended to generate revenue for example research data we are actively developing  In response to an incoming request on this service the Hadoop installation is created per job based on the budget of the submitting user Existing approaches to Hadoop-as-a-service are not sufìcient here as they assume the user is supplying their own data or using a public dataset VI R ELATED W ORK Known limitations exist with regards to security of the Hadoop framework Much w ork is being done to address this For example considers the introduction of hooks/callbacks throughout MapReduce to afford various granularities of control Alternatively Airavat combines mandatory access control and differential privacy to augment the security and privacy of MapReduce jobs At present vendors offer services to facilitate running MapReduce jobs on the cloud e.g Amazon Elastic MapReduce 8  Microsoft Windows Azure HDInsight 9  etc While the potential to run MapReduce on the cloud is beneìcial these services were not designed to effectively share Big Data The DaaSPatcher ecosystem has been introduced to address this requirement VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we speciìed the services required to support enhanced data-as-a-service where a data provider offers not just Big Data but also capacity to process that data locally on their infrastructure via MapReduce jobs A core technology is the ability to lter transform and segment data before it reaches a userês Map task allowing for a single dataset to be the basis of many data sources each offering different segmentation or views on the dataset This increases the market for the providerês data while making data more accessible to users The DaaSPatcher ecosystem covers various roles required to compose services at runtime to offer varied data sources to analytics users We implemented the speciìed services to create a proof-of-concept ecosystem and demonstrated the use of this ecosystem to offer segmented and transformed Twitter datasets in a scalable manner A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by IBM Centres for Advanced Studies CAS the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada NSERC under the Smart Applications on Virtual Infrastructure SAVI Research Network and the Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence project Connected Vehicles and Smart Transportation CVST 8 http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce 9 http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/hdinsight get-started-hdinsight R EFERENCES  S V ijayakumar  A Bhar ga vi U Praseeda and S Ahamed Optimizing sequence alignment in cloud using hadoop and mpp database in

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
