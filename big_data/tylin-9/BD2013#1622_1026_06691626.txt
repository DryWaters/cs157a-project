DP-WHERE Differentially Private Modeling of Human Mobility Darakhshan J Mir   Sibren Isaacman   Ram  on C  aceres   Margaret Martonosi   Rebecca N Wright   Rutgers University  Loyola University Maryland  AT&T Labs  Princeton University Abstract Models of human mobility have broad applicability in urban planning ecology epidemiology and other elds Starting with Call Detail Records CDRs from a cellular telephone network that have gone through a straightforward anonymization procedure the prior WHERE modeling approach produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population The accuracy of WHERE has been validated against billions of location samples for hundreds of thousands of cell phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas In this paper we introduce DPWHERE which modiìes WHERE by adding controlled noise to achieve differential privacy  a strict deìnition of privacy that makes no assumptions about the power or background knowledge of a potential adversary We also present experiments showing that the accuracy of DP-WHERE remains close to that of WHERE and of real CDRs With this work we aim to enable the creation and possible release of synthetic models that capture the mobility patterns of real metropolitan populations while preserving privacy I I NTRODUCTION Models of human mobility have wide applicability to infrastructure and resource planning analysis of infectious disease dynamics ecology and more The abundance of spatiotemporal data from cellular telephone networks affords new opportunities to construct such models Furthermore such data can be gathered with greater detail at larger scale and lower cost than traditional methods such as census surveys Prior work introduced the WHERE Work and Home Extracted REgions approach to mobility modeling In WHERE aggregated collections of cellphone Call Detail Records CDRs form the basis of a mobility model that can be used to characterize a cityês commute patterns and enable the exploration of what-if scenarios regarding changes in residential density telecommuting popularity etc Starting with CDRs from a cellular telephone network that have gone through a straightforward anonymization procedure WHERE produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population WHERE has been experimentally validated against billions of location samples for hundreds of thousands of cell phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas While human mobility models have the potential for great societal beneìts privacy concerns regarding their use of individuals location data have inhibited their release and wider use Although WHERE intuitively provides some privacy because it rests on aggregated distributions of sampled and anonymized data a more rigorous assurance of privacy can further advance safe and widespread use of such techniques In this paper we present and evaluate DP-WHERE a differentially private version of WHERE DP-WHERE satisìes the rigorous requirements of differential privacy while retaining WHEREês usefulness for predicting movement of human populations in metropolitan areas Differential privacy mak es privacy a mathematical requirement on the results of interactions with data In particular differential privacy captures the intuition that in order to provide privacy to individuals the results of an interaction with a database should be almost the same whether or not any particular individual is present in a database This is a strong notion of privacy that makes no assumptions about the power or background knowledge of a potential adversary DP-WHERE achieves differential privacy by adding controlled noise to the set of empirical probability distributions that WHERE uses for example distributions of home and work locations DP-WHERE then proceeds identically to WHERE by systematically sampling these distributions to generate synthetic CDRs containing synthetic locations and associated times Because none of these sampling steps require further access to the original CDRs it would be possible for the data holder to release the noisy distributions while retaining differential privacy Among possible uses these distributions would allow others to produce their own synthetic CDR traces for any desired population size time duration or other parameters Overall our work shows that modest revisions to a mobility model drawn from real-world and large-scale location data allow for rigorous demonstrations of its privacy without overly compromising its utility Speciìc contributions of our work include the following  We are to our knowledge the rst to produce and evaluate a differentially private approach for modeling human mobility based on large sets of cellular network data  Our experiments show that differential privacy can be achieved with only a modest and acceptable reduction in accuracy In particular across a wide array of experiments involving 10,000 synthetic users moving across more than 14,000 square miles the distance between synthetic and real population density distributions for DP-WHERE differed by only 0.17Ö2.2 miles from those of WHERE  More broadly this work shows that there is reason for optimism regarding the judicious use of Big Data repositories of potentially sensitive information We show the value of a multi-pronged approach to privacy Our model starts with attributes such as sampling and aggregation that make it intrinsically well suited to offering some intuitive degree of privacy We subsequently modify the steps of the modeling algorithm to rigorously implement differential privacy

                                     Fig 1 Overview of DP-WHERE which modiìes WHERE by adding noise to achieve differentially private versions of the input probability distributions The rest of WHERE remains unchanged II B ACKGROUND A WHERE DP-WHERE is based on WHERE which produces models of how populations move within metropolitan areas WHERE generates sequences of times and locations that aim to capture how people move between important places in their lives such as home and work Previous work has shown that people spend most of their time at a few such places 12 16 WHERE aggre gates the mo v ements of many synthetic individuals to reproduce human densities over time at the geographic scale of metropolitan areas WHERE draws information from either CDR traces or public sources e.g the US Census Bureau It then creates a set of probability distributions that it uses to drive the generation of synthetic CDRs for the region being modeled This paper uses as its starting point the version of WHERE that uses CDR traces as its data source As shown in Fig 6 this source yields substantially better experimental results than using current publicly available data sources The WHERE modeling algorithm takes as input a database of simpliìed CDRs Complete CDRs contain details not relevant to mobility e.g call-termination codes Each row of this database corresponds to a single voice call or text message both of which we refer to interchangeably as calls WHERE thus uses a database D of m entries corresponding to calls made by n distinct users Each user is indexed by a unique anonymized user ID in the set  n   1  2 n   The calls were made in a given metropolitan area divided into smaller geographic areas by imposing a square grid of d  d cells WHERE leverages earlier work that estimates important places in peopleês lives e.g home and work by applying clustering and regression methods to the CDRs in D 16 In order to work with a single database in DP-WHERE we append to each CDR entry these inferred home and work locations for the corresponding user Thus for the purposes of DP-WHERE each row of D contains the following elds id  date  time  lat  long  home  and work  At its core WHERE uses D to construct cumulative distribution functions CDFs for the following probability distributions see also Fig 1 1 Home and Work  For each grid cell all users with inferred home locations in that grid cell are counted and normalized to produce a probability distribution Home over the grid cells Similarly a Work distribution is constructed from the inferred work locations of users in the database 2 CommuteDistance  WHERE allows for a coarser grid to be used for commute distances than for home and work locations by merging adjoining cells in the underlying d  d grid to yield a d c  d c grid We refer to this coarser grid as the commute grid  For each cell in the commute grid WHERE creates an empirical distribution of commute distances i.e distance between home and work  for people whose home locations are in that grid cell leading to a total of d 2 c of these CommuteDistance distributions 3 CallsPerDay  WHERE computes an empirical distribution CallsPerDay over the set C    min  max    min  max  of possible rounded values of means and standard deviations of numbers of calls per day made by users 4 ClassProb and CallTime  For each user in D  WHERE computes the distribution of when calls are made throughout the day These per-user distributions are then combined using X-Means clustering into two classes Each user belongs to one of two user classes with a probability speciìed by ClassProb  Subsequently using the CDR database perminute call probability distributions CallTime are computed separately for each user class 5 HourlyLocs  For each hour of the day WHERE computes a distribution of calls made over the grid cells Each of those 24 distributions reîects the probability of users being at a given location during that hour The HourlyLocs distributions are not tied to a speciìc user but represent the calling activity across the entire metropolitan area during each hour As shown in Fig 1 subsequent stages of WHERE use the above distributions to produce synthetic CDRs for any number of synthetic users and any length of simulated time WHERE generates a synthetic user as follows It rst selects a home location by sampling from Home  It then selects a commute distance c by sampling CommuteDistance for the commutegrid cell in which the home lies Finally it selects a work location by sampling from Work while restricted to locations at distance c from the home location WHERE then generates synthetic call times and locations for a synthetic user i as follows First it samples from CallsPerDay to obtain a   i  i  tuple that represents i s calling frequency Second it samples from the normal distribution with a mean  i and standard deviation  i to determine the number of calls q that i makes in the current simulated day Third it samples from ClassProb to assign i one of two classes of calling time patterns Fourth it samples CallTime to select the times of day for the q calls that day Finally it samples HourlyLocs to determine the locations of these calls 2 581 


while restricted to the userês home and work locations The synthetic CDR traces that comprise the output of WHERE have been shown to agree closely across a variety of metrics with real-world CDR traces for hundreds of thousands of users moving over metropolitan regions of thousands of square miles B Differential Privacy Differential privacy formalizes the idea that results of a data analysis should be almost the same whether or not an individual is in the database even for individuals with unusual behaviors This implies that the risk to an individual associated with a data analysisÑincluding the risk of being identiìedÑdoes not depend on whether the individual is in the database or not This guarantee holds regardless of the external information available to an adversary Differential privacy relies on the notion of neighboring databases our context two neighboring CDR databases In our context CDR databases D and D  are neighbors if they differ in the records of exactly one user who may have made many calls Deìnition 1 Neighbors  Two CDR databases D and D  are neighbors if D  D  and there is some k   n  such that for every record r  D   D  id  r  k where id  r  denotes the user id in r  Deìnition 2 7  A randomized algorithm A is  differentially private if for all neighboring input data sets D  D  and for all S  Range A   Pr A  D   S   exp    Pr A  D    S   That is the output distributions for a differentially private A are similar for any two neighboring databases The smaller the value of   the closer these two distributions are and hence the higher the privacy The appropriate value for  is a largely open policy question that depends on both privacy and accuracy needs A wide range of values of   e.g from 0.01 to 2.3 have been used in recent work 8 22 An important notion in the application of differential privacy the global sensitivity  of a function of a database is the maximum change in the value of the function over neighboring databases Deìnition 3 7  The global sensitivity of a function f  D  R  is GS f  max D,D   f  D   f  D    1  where D and D  are neighboring databases One way to achieve differential privacy is to add noise to each element of the outcome of f that is proportional to the global sensitivity of f  Speciìcally  l et Lap\(0   denote a Laplace distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation   2   and let 012 Lap\(0     denote a length vector of independent random samples from this distribution Theorem 1 7  For any f  D  R   and  0  the following mechanism A  called the Laplace mechanism is  differentially private A f  D  f  D  012 Lap\(GS f      We make extensive use of the Laplace mechanism in DPWHERE Another generalized way of achieving differential privacy is the exponential mechanism  Informally  the mechanism induces a probability distribution on Range A  that is exponentially biased in favor of outputs that are closer to the real answer f  D   Differential privacy for multi-step algorithms can be provided by breaking the algorithm down into multiple interactions with the database each of which is itself differentially private Thms 2 and 3 formalize this Theorem 2 Serial Composition  Fo r i   k   let A i  D  be an  i differentially private mechanism executed on database D  Then any mechanism A that is a composition of A 1  A 2   A k is  i  i differentially private Theorem 3 Parallel Composition  Fo r i   k   let A i  D  be an  i differentially private mechanism executed on partition D i of the database D  such that  i j  D i 015 D j  0  and each user appears in exactly one of the D i s Then any mechanism A that is a composition of A 1  A 2   A k is max i  i differentially private III D IFFERENTIALLY P RIVATE WHERE Our new approach DP-WHERE modiìes WHERE to provide differential privacy while retaining the accuracy of the original WHERE approach As described in Section II-A WHERE creates and samples from several spatiotemporal distributions In DP-WHERE we render each of these distributions  i differentially private then apply Thms 2 and 3 to arrive at an  differentially private algorithm where    i  i  For each distribution we specify a privacy budget  i that will not be exceeded The remainder of this section describes DPWHERE in detail A Pre-processing Before the algorithm executes we perform a pre-processing step that removes all users who make more than a maximum threshold MaxCallsHr of calls per hour This limits the impact of any one user on the dataset Our experimental evaluation sets MaxCallsHr to 120 which makes it likely that any ltered caller is an auto-dialer Section IV shows it yields good results B Distributions 1 Home and Work We compute differentially private empirical CDFs for Home and Work Let  home and  work be the privacy budgets allocated to computing Home and Work  respectively CountHomeNum i  returns the number of distinct users in the database D with homes in the i th grid cell in the chosen canonical ordering Note that the global sensitivity Def 3 of 012 CountHomeNum\(1  CountHomeNum d 2   is 2 since each user can change his home location from grid cell i to another grid cell j  reducing the count in grid cell i by 1 and increasing j s count by 1 Applying the Laplace mechanism described in Thm 1 Alg III.1 provides an  home differentially private approximation of Home  Similarly the Laplace mechanism achieves an  work differentially private CDF for Work  The noisy CDF does not correspond to a legitimate probability distribution as the noisy counts are not necessarily nondecreasing We use Hay et al.ês post-processing techniques 3 582

Similarly the standard deviation of the number of calls per day is from the set    min  max   Just as for WHERE each  i and  i corresponding to a user i is rounded to the nearest value in the sets M and   respectively  Algorithm III.3 C ALLS P ER D AY CDF  D  cpday  COUNT for    min to  max do  for    min to  max do   M     CountAvgStd     NOISE ADDITION for    min to  max do      for    min to  max do   M      M    Lap\(0  2  cpday   CONVERT TO CDF CDF  PostProc  M output CDF Let CountAvgStd    be a function that counts the number of users whose calls made per day have a rounded mean and standard deviation of  and  respectively Consider the matrix M  of size  M     whose elements corresponds to CountAvgStd     for   M and    Any addition or deletion of calls by a single user can change the mean  standard deviation pair from     to another pair        decreasing the count for at most one element of the matrix M by at most 1 and increasing the count for another element by 1 Therefore the global sensitivity of the vector 012 M   min  min  M   max  min   is 2 Alg III.3 rst counts each userês      At the end of the COUNT process in Alg III.3 element  M    contains CountAvgStd        M     Using Thms 1 and 3 the computation of  M after it goes through NOISE ADDITION is differentially private Next the noisy matrix  M is converted to a CDF by applying post-processing techniques to further reduce the noise Fig 3 sho ws the differentially private approximation of the CDF of the CallsPerDay distribution for different values of  cpday  Lemma 3 Alg III.3ês computation of  M and the CDF of the CallsPerDay distribution is  cpday differentially private 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 x 10 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1     Indices of    airs Original   cpday 0  1   cpday 0  01  Fig 3 CDF of CallsPerDay  Algorithm III.4 DP-K MEANS  P  bdg  it  tol  INITIALIZE ClustCtr 1  Rand  24 ClustCtr 2  Rand  24  calltime  0 ITERATE while  calltime   bdg or err  tol do                                                    OldCtr  ClustCtr 1 OldCtr  ClustCtr 2 ClustSize 1  ClustSize 1  Lap\(0  1   ClustSize 2  ClustSize 2  Lap\(0  1    calltime   calltime   it Sum 1  Sum\(Cluster 1   Lap\(0  2    24 Sum 2  Sum\(Cluster 2   Lap\(0  2    24  calltime   calltime   it ClustCtr 1  Sum 1  ClustSize 1 ClustCtr 2  Sum 2  ClustSize 2 ClustCtr 1  PostProc\(ClustCtr 1  ClustCtr 2  PostProc\(ClustCtr 2  err  dist\(OldCtr 1  ClustCtr 1   dist\(OldCtr 2  ClustCtr 2  output ClustSize 1  ClustSize 2  output ClustCtr 1  ClustCtr 2  calltime  4 Call Times per User Class In DP-WHERE we cluster users into one of the two classes using differentially private k means clustering rather than X-means as used in WHERE From the CDR database D  just as in WHERE we compute the number of calls each user makes during each hour of the day From this a 24-dimension probability vector one dimension for each hour is constructed so that each element represents the probability that a user makes calls during that hour We classify users based on this 24-dimension probability vector An intermediate data structure P that is input for the clustering algorithm Alg III.4 is the set of probability vectors p i for all users i  Each row of P consists of the id of the user and his calling probability vector p i  The input to Alg III.4 consists of P  the target number k 2 in our work of cluster centers the privacy budget for the clustering algorithm  bdg  the amount of the privacy budget  it that is spent for each iteration within the clustering algorithm and the error tolerance tol  Alg III.4 will iterate until either the error is within the range of tolerance or the privacy budget is used up As shown in Alg III.4 we initialize the cluster centers by picking two random 24-dimension probability vectors  Rand  24  Vectors in P are assigned to a cluster depending on which of the two current cluster centers they are closer to Over each iteration the noisy sum of the vectors in ClustCtr i for each current cluster i is computed The global sensitivity of the sum of vectors in ClustSum i   j  Cluster i p j is 2 because  j   n    p j  1 1 since each of the vectors is a probability vector Any change in one personês data can change ClustSum i to another vector ClustSum i    where    2  The size of a cluster has global sensitivity 1 A 584

privacy budget is exhausted or the error falls below the given threshold tol  the algorithm returns the differentially private cluster centers the total privacy budget spent   calltime   and a differentially private computation of the cluster sizes the vector ClustSize  All of this incurs a privacy expenditure of  calltime  We use the cluster centers as calling time probability distributions each element of the cluster center vectors represents the probability that a user in that cluster makes a call during that hour We compute one probability distribution CallTime for each minute of the day and for each user class by interpolating the probability distribution over all minutes between the hours elements of the cluster centers We use ClustSize to determine ClassP rob  the probability of a user belonging to one of the two classes Using Thms 2 and 3 Lemma 4 Alg III.4 gives an  calltime differentially private clustering of the user calling probability vectors Fig 4 shows that DP-WHERE preserves typical diurnal patterns for both classes even for low values of  calltime  5 Hourly Calls per Location For every hour of the day DP-WHERE differentially privately computes a empirical distribution of calls made over every grid cell To do this CountCallsNum i j  is deìned as the function that returns the number of calls users in D make in the i th grid cell between the

CountCallsNum i j   Let NumDays be the number of days that the database D corresponds to The column vector corresponding to calls made over the geographical area during hour j is written as  H   j

mechanism with this level of global sensitivity would add a lot of noise relative to the individual counts To reduce the overall magnitude of noise added we make use of grouping  which groups similar counts together and allows the magnitude of the noise added to each group count to be lower as compared to the total group count Speciìcally we set the group size gsize to be equal to 24  NumDays  This is comparable to the magnitude of noise we will add to the resulting grouped-counts vector Grouping gsize contiguous elements together yields a vector  g  of size gnums   d 2 gsize 012  Each element g  of  g  counts the total number of calls made in locations that appear in group   Note that the global sensitivity of  g  is still MaxCallsHr  NumDays because any one user can make up to a maximum of MaxCallsHr calls during a particular hour of each of these days We then apply the Laplace mechanism to add noise to each group count Finally we replace every individual count H  i j  by the

sequential pattern mining Similarly recently characterized sequences of movements from individual users and found them extremely resistant to privacy techniques In contrast WHERE does not directly model the sequentiality of the spatio-temporal data at the level of an individual Some work 14 considers aspects of dif ferential pri v a c y on spatial data but without DP-WHEREês end-to-end treatment Other characterization work also exists Several recent papers have characterized the privacy risks of releasing location data in each case demonstrating the ability to re-identify individual information from geospatial data sets 11 23 These papers motivated us to look beyond a simple anonymization of location traces In addition Andr  es et al introduce the notion of geo-indistinguishability in location-based systems which protects the exact location of a user while allowing release of information needed to gain access to a service VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK DP-WHERE provides differential privacy while maintaining the utility of WHERE for modeling human mobility from realworld cellular network data Our work shows it is possible to balance privacy and utility in practical big data applications Extensions to DP-WHERE could further improve its already strong accuracy In particular we note that the phones used in this study were sampled from a much larger set of millions of phones in each metropolitan area of interest In our case independent random samples were drawn from phones billed to each ZIP code in a metropolitan area If we instead sample uniformly over all phones in a metropolitan area we can improve the overall privacy guarantees of our algorithm as noted by Cormode et al F o r e xample sampling 5 of phones from a database of millions of phones and running our DP-WHERE algorithm over the calls these phones generate would yield an order of magnitude improvement in the privacy parameter   Conversely this sampling could be used to achieve a given  with much less noise addition We hope that DP-WHERE constitutes a signiìcant step towards enabling cellular telephony providers to unlock the value of their location data for applications with broad societal beneìts such as urban planning and epidemiology without compromising privacy Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under
