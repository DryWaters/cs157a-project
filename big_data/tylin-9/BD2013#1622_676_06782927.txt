An Efficient Transportation Architecture for Big Data Movement  Weisheng Hu, Weiqiang Sun, Yaohui Jin, Wei Guo and Shilin Xiao State Key Laboratory of Advanced Opti cal Communications Systems and Networks Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai, 200240, China wshu@sjtu.edu.cn   Abstract Big data are transferred, routed and forward to their destinations as a combination of a series of packets one by one without considering the data in their entity in todayês packet network. In this paper, we firstly summarize those transportation methods of bid data on packet networks and optical networks, respectively, and then propose a new data 
transportation architecture to collect, store and reshape the data flows in large time scale until it find the connection segments available on schedule. It leverages both circuit and storage merits together to form a now network node, which is termed as SSS in this paper. The intermediate storages act to relay and bridge these sub-connections into an equivalent entirety Keywords-Big Data; Optical Transport Network; Optical Switching; data transportation I   I NTRODUCTION H EADING 1  It is well accepted that the Internet data traffic increases 2050% yearly [1 A s th e s t a b l e ex p o n e n tia l g r ow th of th e d a ta  
traffic, handling so large data setsÑso-called big dataÑwill become a key basis of competition according to McKinsey report [2 B i g d a t a  is  a c o ll ecti o n o f d a ta  se ts  so la rg e  a n d  complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand data management tools. The challenges include capture, curation storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis, and visualization [3   Big data spans four dimensions: volume, velocity, variety and veracity, and is moved across the network more frequently, and often, in larger size In particularly, modern frontier science is increasingly datadriven and collaborative in nature. Scientists regularly 
encounter limitations due to large data sets in many areas including genomics, connectomics, meteorology, complex physics simulations, and biological and environmental researches [4   A ll of th is is  big d a t a at h i g h v e l o ci ties  S o m e  workflows require the ability to move a single 100TB data set in just a few hours. This will require hosts with 100Gbps interfaces and extremely efficient data transfer protocols. As the network pipelines are expanded in scale, efficient protocols and tools are necessary to move vast amounts of scientific data over high-bandwidth networks in such collaborations [5 In todayês packet networks, data are transferred across the network as a combination of a series of packets, delivered one 
by one, without considering the data in their entirety with respective service quality requirements. Consequently, the quality of service of interactive big data applications is hard to provision, and the utility of network is low [6 an d  th e  enhancement in transmission protocols becomes much urgent Intuitively, by relaxing the delivery time of big data files according to their respective priorities, the network resources may be used more efficiently and network congestion can be alleviated, and optical network running in circuit switching pattern could play a new role to do so In this paper, we propose and discuss a new data transfer model on optical network to complement the existing per 
packet forwarding paradigm on packet network. In the new data transfer model, instead of transferring these data on perpacket bases immediately upon entering the network, the optical network stores the data until it find necessary, or enough network resource is available for that transfer, or delivery the data in step-by-step ways with the help of relay storage in each switching nodes. The scheduled data transfer is realized through the use of dynamic circuit switching paradigm 12-18   The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we will provide a brief overview on the data transportation methods on packet networks. In section III, we 
will discuss the big data file transportation methods on optical networks with generalized multi-protocol label switching GMPLS\ntrolling based on our earlier work in this field. In section IV, we will discuss the as-proposed new model with the combination of optical circuit pipelines in each link and temporary storages in each node. It will be seen that the performance is improved for the big data movement II  BID  DATA  TRANSPORTATION  ON  PACKET  NETWORK Most data movement tools today rely on transmission control protocol \(TCP\ over sockets, which limits flows to 
some bound on todayês hardware and software. Efficient protocols and tools are necessary to move vast amounts of big scientific data over high-bandwidth long-distance networks in such collaborations. Some of these efforts are briefly overviewed in this section A  Standard TCP This work is supported by the 863 Program 978-1-4799-0434-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE ICICS 2013 


The TCP is a well-known transport layer network protocol and used for reliable communications on packet network. In general, TCP performs congestion and flow controls jointly by using the concept of windows to throttle the amount of data that the sender injects into the network, depending on the receiverês available capacity and link traffic. When TCP detects a packet loss, it decides to perform congestion control When the receiver does not have sufficient memory for receiving data from the sender, it performs the flow control. In the basic version, it uses an additive-increase multiplicativedecrease \(AIMD\trategy for changing its windows as a function of network conditions   In order to continuously fill the link capacity, TCP must maintain the window size into the round trip time \(RTT multiplied by the bandwidth, called the Bandwidth-Delay Product \(BDP\[7-8 T h e  i n cr ea se i n l i n k spe ed a n d di st a n c e  e.g., optic fibers\has led to paths of large BDP. TCP window must be able to reach such large values in order to efficiently use the available bandwidth. However, at larger windows congestion may lead to the loss of many packets from the same connection. As a result, TCP has performance problems over long-distance high-bandwidth networks in wide area scenario In some cases, for example, basic TCP performance on long distance may be lower with 10Gbps, e.g., 9.2 Gbps at 0.2 miles, 8.2 Gbps at 1400 miles, and 2.3-2.5 Gbps at more than 6600 mile  B  Enhancement TCP Most current congestion control algorithms in TCP family detect congestion and slow down when they discover that packets are being dropped. But packet loss only provides a single bit of information about the congestion level, whereas delay is a continuous quantity and in principle could provide more information about the network condition. Much effort is paid to enhance the TCP performance for decades. Among them, for example, a FAST TCP flow seeks to maintain a constant number of packets in queues throughout the network routers. If too few packets are queued, the sending rate is increased, while if too many are queued, the rate is decreased FAST TCP has the ability to rapidly stabilize high-speed longlatency networks into steady, efficient and fair operating points in dynamic sharing environments  On the other hand, parallel data transmission can establish multiple connections simultaneously, and, therefore, data sets are split and transferred in parallel through each connection. It should be noted that this technique operates at the application level. For example, GridFTP uses this technique and complement the shortcomings of TCP buffer tuning, and simultaneously achieve maximum throughput on highperformance long distance network environments. Parallel data transferring, unlike buffer tuning, can obtain the maximum achievable throughput by using a sufficient number of streams is stronger than the buffer tuned stream against packet loss, is effective regardless of RTT, and at last, increasing the number of parallel streams reduces the traffic interference [8  C  InfiniBand WAN Since InfiniBand came onto the scene, researchers have firstly focused on the high performance network fabric to connect compute and storage equipments within datacenters Later on, researchers have extended InfiniBand connectivity for wide area networks \(WANs\. From the application's viewpoint the remote compute and storage nodes look and act as if they are sitting right next to each other [10 The benefits of long distance InfiniBand mirror its advantages in the datacenter, namely high bandwidth and low latency. But the WAN InfiniBand performance will not always match the local performance. It is demonstrated a data rate of up to 8 Gbps over thousands of miles across 10 Gbps backbone Both bandwidth and latency tends to drop if it goes farther, but unlike the TCP implementation, quality of service is maintained [10   D  RDMA over Converged Ethernet \(RoCE Remote Direct Memory Access \(RDMA\over Converged Ethernet \(RoCE\ is a network protocol that allows remote direct memory access over an Ethernet network. RDMA operates on the principle of transferring data directly from the user-defined memory of one system to another. The advantages of RDMA are lower latency, lower CPU load and higher bandwidth. In effect, RoCE is InfiniBand protocols made to work over Ethernet infrastructure. The notion of çconverged Etherneté, also known as enhanced or data center Ethernet includes various extensions to the IEEE 802.1 standards to provide prioritization, flow control and congestion notification at the link laye  E x p e r i m e nt pro ve s t h at R o CE i s  a promising technology for high-performance network data movement with minimal CPU impact over circuit-based infrastructures. Researchers compared the performance of TCP and RoCE over high latency 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps network paths, and showed that RoCE-based data transfers can fill a 40 Gbps path, outperform the TCP implementation [11    III  BIG  DATA  TRANSPORTATION  ON  OPTICAL  NETWORK In the deployed backbone network for telecom operators and the test-beds for large science projects, optical networks are inevitably used as the fundamental transport platforms for both science collaborations and packet network bearings. It means that some of the optical network pipelines are used to bear the packet networks, and some for the science applications at the same time. The latter will be summarized and discussed in this section A  Data Driven Dynamic Optical Pipelines Some e-Science projects over the world need high-speed networks provided by the optical network test-beds, such as the user controlled light paths \(UCLP\ CA*net4, Starlight network in Europe, circuit-switched high-speed end-to-end transport architecture \(CHEETAH\, dynamic resource allocation via GMPLS optical networks \(DRAGON OptiPuter, optical metro network initiative \(OMNInet\, 3Tnet in China, and some others [12-16   In general, optical pipelines are in the form of either wavelength channels or sub-wavelength Ethernet/SDH synchronous digital hierarchy\ connections. A widely and implicitly assumption is that at any specific time, there exists 


only one communication task in each pair of end systems, and it will occupy the whole bandwidth. So the dynamic provisioning performances have deterministic influence on these applications [17   Motivated by the above discussion, and also by our involvement in building and testing a GMPLS network test-bed of 3Tnet in the cities centered at Shanghai, we have proposed to define a set of metrics to characterize the dynamic optical pipeline provisioning performance of GMPLS networks. Two documents submitted to the IETF working group were published as Request for Comments \(RFC\ with number 5814 and 6477. In these documents, we defined a set of performance metrics, including unidirectional and bidirectional setup delays graceful release delay and their statistic features in both the data and control planes [18-19 T h e per for m a n c e  t o t r a n sfe r big data files is promising as field trail has demonstrated [20   B  Multiple Connections Per Optical Interface In more actual scenario, end hosts are assumed to have concurrent communication requirements with different remote parities. So we extended the GMPLS-controlled network by proposing a data flow-based VLAN \(virtual local area network tagging and switching technique to provide virtual interfaces with multiple connectivity in a single optical interface [13     Figure 1  Network model with a multiple connectivity interface \(MCI\ and implementation setup [1   Figure 1 shows the network model with multiple connectivity interfaces \(MCIs\ On each end host, Ethernet frames are tagged according to their network or transport layer addresses before they are actually sent to the link. As an example, all the frames generated by one host and destined for other hosts are tagged with different VLAN ID numbers. In addition to VLAN tagging on end hosts, we introduces dynamic VLAN-to-VCG \(virtual concatenation group mapping into Ethernet over SDH devices. Whenever a communication task is scheduled on end hosts, a free VLAN ID will be allocated, and a circuit is established in the form of a routed VCG. At the same time, the ingress network element is informed of VLAN and VCG correspondence. After VLAN-toVCG mapping is established on the ingress network element tagged Ethernet frames are processed subsequently The as-mentioned approach enables an Ethernet interface to establish more than one connection with different remote interfaces and, therefore, realizes the MCIs. In our implementation, the minimum switching granularity is VC-4 155Mb/s\, and a gigabit Ethernet interface can establish connectivity with up to eight different remote MCIs. Each of these connections has dedicated bandwidth of a single VC-4. In short, an MCI-enabled end host can establish connectivity with different remote interfaces through the circuits of varied smaller granularity [13, 20   In the wavelength division multiplexed \(WDM\ network, a good percentage of sub-wavelength traffic will still need to be transported over the one wavelength with muxponder solutions The optical transport network \(OTN\ hierarchy provides a rich foundation for flexibly aggregating mixed-rate client signals onto higher rate wavelengths and switches. Non-OTN client circuits of one gigabit and higher rates in Ethernet and other formats are transparently wrapped, groomed, and mapped into higher capacity wavelengths in flexible combinations [21 C  Flexible Optical Pipelines More recently, researchers are discussing the software defined optical transport network \(SD-OTN\ as evolution of next-generation optical networks with flexible granularity With the help of software defined network \(SDN\ethod OTN can have the features of instant bandwidth provisioning flexible bandwidth pipeline, and programmable transport controller, which meet the demands of forthcoming high-speed and highly-dynamic traffic boom and bring network operators with benefits of 100% resource utilization. It leaves room for future implementation and standardization [21   Under the MCI model discussed earlier, because portions of physical interface bandwidth can be provisioned to multiple TCP sessions, the available bandwidth is not constant. To maximize the link utilization, it would be significant to investigate how active packet transport sessions respond to bandwidth change when the number of active sessions changes On the other hand, mechanisms can be devised so that once an upper layer notices a decrease in its bandwidth consumption, it can notify the underlying optical provisioning entity to adjust the provisioned bandwidth such that high bandwidth utilization efficiency can be achieved. Some novel cross-layer mechanisms can still be investigated to further increase end-toend performance [13 IV  BIG  DATA  TRANSPORTATION  ON  OPTICAL  NETWORK  WITH  STORAGE  RELAYS  A  NEW  PARADIGM The number of connections established on circuit network at a given moment is limited due to the add/drop interfaces and the line capacity. To increase it, one way is to provide parallel connections per each end interfaces as discussed in the MCI model. The second way is to tune the bandwidth of connections and to release more unoccupied bandwidth to accommodate more connections as discussed in SD-OTN model. In this section, we will discuss another way by segment the long connection which bypasses more nodes into several short subconnections in its path with the storages to relay and bridge these sub-connections as an equivalent entirety  


A  A Store, Schedule and Switch Architecture The as-proposed architecture is called a Store, Schedule and Switch \(SSS\ model by employing both advantages of storage and circuit switching. For conceptual understanding, herewith we take a one-dimension topology for example, as showed in figure 2. Five nodes with label 1 to 5 have both crossconnection matrix and storage inside. Assume the capacity of each link between neighboring nodes is equal for simplicity When two connection requests arrives simultaneously, which are labeled C1\(1, 4\ between node 1 and 4, and C2\(3, 5 between 3 and 5, clearly, both requests cannot be meet simultaneously due to the overflow between node 3 and 4. So only one of them, such as C1\(1, 4\ is satisfied first, and the other one C2\(3, 5\ is rejected, or delayed to the second time slot.  In our paradigm, we segmented the rejected C2\(3, 5\ into two sub-connections as C2sub\(3, 4\ and C2sub\(4, 5 respectively. Now the C2sub\(4, 5\ can be provisioned with the C1\(1,4\ogether, and only the C2sub\(3, 4\ is delayed to the subsequent time slot. By intuition, short connections in the following time slot have lower probability to overlap and collide with each other, and, as a result, the performance is improved, as discussed in the following sections  Figure 2  The as-proposed Store, Schedule and Switch \(SSS\Model B  The SSS Schedulling Method [23  Figure 3 shows the scheduling in the as-proposed SSS Model. When there is data ready to send, the data source sends a request to a centralized scheduler \(e.g. SDN controller through the type \(1\ interface, providing information such as data size, destination and priority \(e.g., deadline of delivery Upon receiving such a request, the scheduler makes a decision on whether the request can be admitted, according to historical request information. If the request is admitted, the data source sends the data to the nearest switching node \(the ingress node and the data is then stored in the network. Data from multiple sources under the same switching node are aggregated in the storage. The data for the same destination egress node and with close delivery deadlines form a delivery batch. As the deadline of a batch approaches, the scheduler configures a \(virtual circuit for the batch through the type \(2\ interface, and moves it to the storage on the egress node. After arriving at the egress node, the data in the batch are delivered to their destination applications through their respective procedures. It is worth noting that although type \(1\ interface exists between the scheduler and all data sources/sinks, and type \(2\nterface exists between the scheduler and all switching nodes, only a few are illustrated for simplicity. Also for simplicity, the other network devices that connect multiple data sources/sinks to a SSS switching node through adding and dropping interfaces are not shown in the figure  Figure 3  Scheduling in the as-proposed Store, Schedule and Switch \(SSS Model [23  It is apparent that the introduction of storage into circuit switching networks relaxes the delivery timeliness of data, and hence is helpful to use the network resources in a more uniform and balanced manner. The higher the storage capacity is, and the less tighter requirements application data have on delivery deadline, the higher capacity an SSS network might have. Here high capacity means that more data delivery request can be admitted and accomplished. In this sense, the storage on switching nodes helps to reduce conflicts among those data delivery requests arrives closely in time, a very close analogy to the use of buffers in routers to avoid packet contentions. The former could scheduling and storing the data in minutes or even hours owing to its big storage, whereas the latter in microsecond due to its small buffer size and best-effort mechanism In particular, when the network is large, it might be difficult to establish a high capacity \(virtual\ circuit across the whole network. This often happened in the deployed networks which are always divided into different administration domains with different technologies and operated by different carriers. In that case, installing storage on intermediate nodes and especially at the boundary can improve the network performance by delivering data in more stops with the intermediate storages to relay and bridge the sub-connections as a final equivalent entirety in a larger time scale It is also worth noting that the SSS architecture does not impose any particular requirements on the underline \(virtual circuit switching network. Any network technology that is capable to provision bandwidth guaranteed pipes can be used to implement SSS. For instance, SSS can be implemented on a wavelength switched optical network, on a packet network with Traffic Engineering, or on a SDN with OpenFlow control. It is apparent that such a capability will give the scheduler more flexibility in scheduling different sized data batches in larger time scale and at the cost of higher computing complexity Fortunately, the computing ability is available with the help of computer cluster  Scheduling Switching node Storage on Switching Nodes Scheduled Data Deliver y Control Interface        C 1 1,4 N ode 1        Node 2         Node 3        Node 4         Node 5 C 2 3,5 C 2sub 3,4 C 2sub  4,5  


C  Preliminary Performance Evaluation [23 A preliminary performance evaluation of SSS networks is conducted through simulations on the 14-node NSFNET. In the simulation, every switching node is equipped with storage Link speed in the network is assumed to be 10 Gbps. Figure 4 shows how the number/ratio of discarded data is related to storage equipped on each switching node and to the traffic load It shows that increasing the storage capacity on switching nodes is helpful to reduce the number of discarded data caused by lack of storage. Meanwhile, increasing the storage capacity will increase the number of accepted data flows and will ultimately increase the number of data flows that cannot be delivered without the node storage. So the overall discard ratio decrease slightly as the storage capacity increases  Figure 4  Number of discarded data vs. storage capacity V  CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we discuss the big data transportation on different network layers with different transferring paradigm Traditionally, big data are delivered by using the enhancement TCP and similar tools on packet network. Some other researches discussed the data transportation on optical network We have demonstrated GMPLS controlled network delivered big data files dynamically on field trail. Herewith we proposed and discuss the combination of circuit and storage together to form a now network node, which is termed as SSS. This will be a new paradigm promising for the future big data transportation A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the 863 Program, the university research fund for the doctoral program of priority development areas \(20110073130006\he NSFC \(61221001\ and 973 program of China \(2010CB328204/5 R EFERENCES  1  Cicso, Visual Networking Index \(VNI\ Global IP Traffic Forecast, 20122017, http://www.cisco.com 2  James Manyika, Michael Chui, Brad Brown, Jacques Bughin, Richard Dobbs, Charles Roxburgh, Angela Hung Byers, Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity, Report by McKinsey Global Institute, May 2011 3  IBM, Big Data at the speed of business, http://www01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata 4  BGI tech, http://bgitechsolutions.com 5  B.

a common set of requirements for a new science database system which is named SciDB In recent years techniques in traditional databases have been integrated into scientiìc datasets The inde xing scheme is a representati v e e xample In 10 the authors de v eloped the F astBit system to pro vide a set of compressed bitmap indexes Various research efforts have been carried out to optimize queries over the scientiìc dataset In the authors designed tools to support user deìned subsetting and aggregation over NetCDF datasets In their system the query results are aggregated on the server side before returning to the process which reduces the data transfer cost In this research we propose and study a fast data analysis approach with integrated statistical metadata The proposed approach has a similar idea to the indexing scheme but is lightweight and incurs signiìcantly less storage overhead when compared to the indexing schemes In addition the FASM approach complements existing database techniques that are already adopted for scientiìc datasets An even better performance is expected when they are combined together The ADIOS also demonstrates that integrating the statistical metadata could potentially improve the performance 1 Ho we v e r  the current ADIOS only supports collecting local simple statistical and/or analytical data during the output operation for use in identifying desired datasets The FASM system provides the mechanism of integrating the statistical metadata during the initial write In addition this metadata can be further utilized This research has studied various subsetting schemes and the impact on performance as well Parallel netCDF PnetCDF is a library that provides highperformance I/O while maintaining le-format compatibility with Unidataês NetCDF Our F ASM system is prototyped based on PnetCDF currently All these work have shown the importance of scientiìc datasets and data management libraries In this study we propose an approach to subsetting dataset and integrating with statistics Our study complements these existing datasets and libraries and can be helpful to many data-intensive applications VI CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Scientiìc datasets are used in many data-intensive computing elds such as climate modeling high-energy physics astrophysics computational chemistry computational biology medicine discovery etc Research efforts have started integrating modern database techniques and parallel I/O into the management of scientiìc datasets In this work we proposed a new idea of adding statistical metadata into the datasets The statistical metadata illustrates the data distribution features therefore the parallel access code can utilize this metadata to perform fast queries and data analysis Through experimental tests and evaluations we have shown how the integrated statistical metadata improves the query and analysis performance We have also analyzed the impact of various subsetting schemes statistics generating scalability and overhead The evaluation results have indicated that the FASM approach is promising and can be beneìcial to many data-intensive scientiìc applications In the near future we will investigate further to support data modiìcations resubsetting and regeneration of statistics in the FASM at runtime We will study the feasibility of automatic selection of statistics considering applications access patterns as well R EFERENCES  ADIOS http://www olcf.ornl.go v/center projects/adios  Atmospheric pressure http://en.wikipedia.or g/wiki/Atmos pheric_pressure  BCCR

In addition we also explicitly computed the max-min fair ow bandwidths for these trafìc proìles using the water-ìlling algorithm W e compared the resulting aggre gate throughput to those reported by the simulator For all evaluated trafìc patterns the simulator throughput was within 10 of those reported by the maxmin validator This small difference is because the TCPês AIMD congestion control mechanism only yields approximate max-min fairness in ow bandwidths whereas the validator computes a perfectly max-min fair distribution 6.2 HyperX Networks We rst evaluate Dahu with HyperX networks which have many paths of differing lengths between any source and destination We simulate a  L 3 S 14 T 48 HyperX network with 1Gbps links as described in This models a lar ge data center with 131,712 servers interconnected by 2,744 switches and an oversubscription ratio of 1:8 We seek to measure how Dahuês non-minimal routing and load balancing affect performance as we vary trafìc patterns the maximum derouting threshold and non-minimal routing scheme constrained or not We run simulations with Clique and Mixed trafìc patterns described next and compare the throughput average hop count and link utilizations for Dahu and ECMP In the graphs Dahun refers to Dahu routing with at most n deroutings C-Dahun refers to the similar Constrained Dahu routing variant 6.2.1 Clique Trafìc Pattern A Clique is a subset of switches and associated hosts that communicate among themselves each host communicates with every other host in its clique over time This represents distributed jobs in a data center which are usually run on a subset of the server pool A typical job runs on a few racks of servers There could be multiple cliques or jobs running in different parts of the network We parameterize this trafìc pattern by i clique size the number of switches in the clique and ii total number of cliques in the network In this experiment we vary the total number of cliques from 64 to 768 keeping the clique size xed at 2 switches 96 servers Each source switch in a clique generates 18Gbps of trafìc with 1.5 MB average ow size  Figure 8 Throughput gain with Clique trafìc pattern Bandwidth Figure 8 shows the bandwidth gains with Dahu relative to ECMP as we vary the number of communicating cliques Dahu offers substantial gains of 400-500 over ECMP The performance gain is highest with a smaller number of cliques showing that indeed derouting and non-shortest path forwarding can effectively take advantage of excess bandwidth in HyperX networks a Average hop count         b Link utilization number of cliques  512 Figure 9 Average hop count and link utilization for Clique trafìc pattern with different routing schemes This validates a major goal of this work which is improving the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth in direct network topologies As the number of cliques increases the bandwidth slack in the network decreases and the relative beneìt of non-minimal routing comes down to around 250 Dahu and constrained Dahu have similar performance for the same derouting threshold We further nd that a large derouting threshold provides larger beneìt with less load since there are many unused links in the network As load increases links are more utilized on average bandwidth slack reduces and a derouting threshold of one starts performing better Hop count Beyond raw throughput latency in an important performance metric that is related to network hop count Figure 9a shows the average hop count for each routing scheme Dahu delivers signiìcantly higher bandwidth with a small increase in average hop count Average hop count increases with increase in derouting threshold For smaller derouting threshold the hop count is similar to that of ECMP while still achieving most of the bandwidth improvements of non-minimal routing Note that the small error bars indicate that the average hop count is similar while varying the number of cliques Link utilization Figure 9b shows the CDF of inter-switch link utilizations for ECMP and Dahu for the experiment with 512 cliques With shortest path routing 90 of the links have zero utilization whereas Dahu achieves its bandwidth gains by utilizing available capacity on additional links in the network Also we see that a single derouting can achieve most of the overall bandwidth gains while consuming bandwidth on signiìcantly fewer links in the network thereby sparing network capacity for more trafìc 67

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
