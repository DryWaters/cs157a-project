The paper describes how IBM, for its internal data center environments, has been integrating technology areas such as Mobile, Predictive Analytics Cloud computing, big data such as Hadoop, Monitoring, and Agile environments. The future of Smart Green Infrastructure will depend on how dynamically an IT team can carve out the needs for implementing complex projects in a quick, easy structured and dynamic environment while focusing in the innovation space using advanced technology. The paper describes how such Smart Green Infrastructures are managed and maintained to promote Green initiatives for Innovation while leveraging the use of predictive analytics in the environment Case studies are described that include discussions on challenges faced and lessons learned Keywords-component; green infrastructure; carbon footprint mobile computing; cloud computing; big data; analytics; SSD agile; green IT I  I NTRODUCTION   In the past, data centers were spread across different regions and there were servers in the data centers which were mostly physical servers. With this setup, there was always a great need for space, power consumption and more resources Maintaining these servers thereby resulted in increased operating costs for data centers. To address these problems the Smart Green Infrastructure was envisioned. The main purpose of the Smart Green Infrastructure is to reduce the foot print of physical servers in the data center by adapting a more virtualized environment. This has resulted in significantly reduced maintenance costs and power consumption, along with much improved PUE \(Power Usage Effectiveness metrics. The scope of the Green infrastructure project is not limited to current projects requirements, but is built in a 223Smart\224 way such that it aligns with the technology road map areas planned by the IBM business and the organization for its data centers. In our environment we achieved this with a limited space in the following ways 1  Identified all the legacy applications that were deployed on the physical environment and setup a migration plan to move to a more virtualized environment 2  Reduced the server foot print by vertically and horizontally scaling the applications so that resources are effectively utilized 3  Divided the data center into high density and low density thermal zones. The high density thermal zone hosts the IT equipment and servers that consume a lot of power and dissipate more heat.  The low density thermal zone hosts the IT equipment and servers that consumes less power and dissipate less heat. By having two thermal zones, we could identify which component goes where and how this could impact the overall infrastructure  The smartness in Green infrastructure is not just limited to the use of the latest technology and server components but it also defines how this infrastructure could serve different purposes by leveraging the use of new technology in Mobile Predictive Analytics, Cloud computing, Big data \(such as Hadoop\, Monitoring, storage hardware, and Agile environments, with reduced server footprint.  For this paper we\222ll follow this Outline  1  Introduction 2  Evolution and Planning for Smart Green Infrastructure 3  The Significance of Virtualization and Cloud Computing 4  Ways to promote Green Initiatives 5  Predictive Analytics, Mobile Access, Agile Methods and SSD 6  Private Cloud Case Studies 7  Conclusions  II  E VOLUTION AND P LANNING FOR S MART G REEN I NFRASTRUCURE  A first step in the implementation of any new business process for energy efficiency, is to \223baseline\224 the energy use at your data centers.

Data centers consume much more energy per square foot than any other part of an office building. Figure 1 shows the distribution of space and energy costs at IBM buildings Although data centers are less than 5% of the space cost at IBM, they account for almost 50% of the energy cost.  A study at a major bank indicated that data centers accounted for just 1% of the bank\222s physical infrastructure space but consume about 25% of the power. So, there is a great deal of incentive to create green data centers  Figure 1  IBM Distribution of Space and Energy Costs \(Source IBM Corporate Environmental Affairs, Year end 2010 The process used by IBM for creating energy efficient 223green\224 data centers consists of five basic steps [3 T h e five  process steps are:  diagnose, manage & measure, use energy efficient cooling, virtualize, and build new or upgrade facilities when feasible A  Diagnose the Opportunies and Problems The step here is to do a data-center energy-efficiency assessment.  Many data center energy consultants will bring in tools such as Mobile Measurement Technology \(MMT\to look at \223hot spots\224 in the data center and areas where cold and hot air mix too early and thereby waste energy.  The assessment should include a list of unused IT equipment that can be turned off.  In addition, the diagnostic phase can help encourage organizations to retire unused software applications and focus on adopting more effective software that requires fewer CPU cycles.  A typical x86 server consumes between 30% and 40 of its maximum power when idle. IT organizations should turn off servers that don't appear to be performing tasks.  If anyone complains, organizations should look into whether the littleused application can be virtualized.  Check with your electric utility.  Some utilities offer free energy audits  B  Manage and Measure Many hardware products have built-in power management features that are never used. Most major vendors have been implementing such features for quite some time.  These features include the ability of the CPU to optimize power by dynamically switching among multiple performance states. The CPU will drop its input voltage and frequency based on how many instructions are being run on the chip itself. These types of features can save organizations up to 20% on server power consumption C  Cool Many data centers may use hot aisle/cold aisle configurations to improve cooling efficiency, but there are also some small adjustments they can make. Simple "blanking panels" can be installed in server racks that have empty slots That's a great way to make sure the cold air in the cold aisle doesn't start mixing with the hot air in the hot aisle any sooner than it needs to. Organizations should also seal cable cutouts to minimize airflow bypasses. Data organizations should consider air handlers and chillers that use efficient technologies such as variable frequency drives which adjust how fast the air conditioning system's motors run when cooling needs dip D  Virtualize Virtualization continues to be one of the hottest green data center topics. Many current server CPU utilization rates typically hover between 5% and 15%. Direct-attached storage utilization sits between 20% and 40%, with network storage between 60% and 80%. Virtualization can increase hardware utilization by five to 20 times and allows organizations to reduce the number of power-consuming servers.  Cloud computing is the \223ultimate\224 in virtualization and we\222ll discuss virtualization and cloud computing in more detail later in this paper E  Build Going Green is easiest if you are building a new data center. First, you make a calculation of your compute requirements for the foreseeable future. Next, you plan a data center for modularity in both its IT elements and its power and cooling. Then you use data center modeling and thermal assessment tools and software \226 available from vendors such as APC, IBM, HP and Sun \226 to design the data center. The next step is to procure Green from the beginning \226 which partly means, buy the latest equipment and technologies such as blade servers and virtualization Once you have the equipment, you integrate it into high density modular compute racks, virtualize servers and storage put in consolidated power supply, choose from a range of modern cooling solutions and, finally, run, monitor and manage the data center dynamics using sensors that feed real-time compute, power and cooling data into modern single-view management software that dynamically allocates resources.  An overview of the energy efficiency strategy used by IBM for green data centers is shown in Figure 2  


   Figure 2  An Energy Efficiency Strategy for IBM Smart Green Infrastructures III  T HE S IGNIFICANCE OF VIRTUALIZATION AND CLOUD COMPUTING FOR S MART G REEN I NFRASTRUCTURE  The most-significant step most organizations can make in moving to green data centers is to implement virtualization for their Information Technology \(IT\ data center devices. The IT devices include servers, data storage, and clients \(or desktops used to support the data center.  There is also a virtual IT world of the future - via private cloud computing - for most of our data centers.  Although the use of cloud computing in your company\222s data center for mainstream computing may be off in the future, some steps towards private cloud computing for mainstream computing within your company are currently available.  Server clusters are here now and being used in many company data centers. Although cost reduction usually drives the path to virtualization, often the most important reason to use virtualization is IT flexibility.  The cost and energy savings due to consolidating hardware and software are very significant benefits and nicely complement the flexibility benefits.  The use of virtualization technologies is usually the first and most important step we can take in creating energy efficient and green data centers  A  Reasons for Creating Virtual Servers Consider this basic scenario.  You\222re in charge of procuring additional server capacity at your company\222s data center.  You have two identical servers, each running different Windows applications for your company.  The first server \226 let\222s call it Server A \226 is lightly used, reaching a peak of only 5% of its CPU capacity and using only 5% of its internal hard disk.  The second server \226 let\222s call it Server B \226 is using all of its CPU averaging 95% CPU utilization\ and has basically run out of hard disk capacity \(i.e. the hard disk is 95% full\.  So you have a real problem with Server B.  However, if you consider Server A and Server B together, on average the combined servers are using only 50% of their CPU capacity and 50% of their hard disk capacity.  If the two servers were actually virtual servers on a large physical server, the problem would be immediately solved since each server could be quickly allocated the resource each needs.  In newer virtual server technologies - e.g Unix Logical Partitions \(LPARS\with micro-partitioning \226 each virtual server can dynamically \(instantaneously\crease the number of CPUs available by utilizing the CPUs currently not in use by other virtual servers on the large physical machine.  The idea is that each virtual server gets the resource required based on the virtual server\222s immediate need My favorite diagram for describing the reasons to use server and data storage virtualization is shown in Figure 3 This diagram shows typical server utilization for stand-alone servers \(i.e. NO virtualization\.  The multi-million dollar mainframes are typically utilized on a 24/7 basis at least partly because of the large financial investment.  Mainframe \223batch\224 processes such as running daily, weekly, and monthly corporate summary reports are typically CPU intensive and are run at night and on the weekends.  The small department Windows server \(labeled \223Intel-based\224 in the diagram\ is not typically used at night or on the weekends.  Creating virtual servers of those Intel-based servers not only allows much better and easier sharing of resources for a mix of lightly and heavily used servers \(as in the Server A/Server B example above\ but also tends to spread out the utilization over 24 hours on the large physical server that houses the virtual servers   Server Virtualization - the Reason Current Asset Utilization  Stand-Alone Servers  225 52 225 N/A 225 N/A 225 Storage 225 2-5 225 5-10 225 30 225 Intel-based 225 10 225 10-15 225 50-70 225 UNIX 225 60 225 70 225 85-100 225 Mainframes  24-hour Period Utilization  Prime-shift Utilization   Peak-hour Utilization Source IBM Scorpion White Paper: Simplifying the Corporate IT Infrastructure, 2000  Figure 3  Server Virtualization \226 The Reason B  Cloud Computing \226 The Ultimate in Virtualization Cloud computing is a new \(circa late 2007\ label for the subset of grid computing that includes utility computing and other approaches to the use of shared computing resources Cloud computing is an alternative to having local servers or personal devices handling users' applications. Essentially, it is an idea that the technological capabilities should "hover" over everything and be available whenever a user wants. Although the early publicity on cloud computing was for public offerings over the public Internet by companies such as Amazon and Google, private cloud computing is starting to come of age.  A private cloud is a smaller cloudlike IT system within a corporate firewall that offers shared services to a closed internal network.  Consumers of such a cloud would include the employees across various divisions and departments business partners, suppliers, resellers, and other organizations Shared services on the infrastructure side such as computing power or data storage services or on the application side such 


as a single customer information application shared across the organization are suitable candidates for such an approach. Of course IT virtualization would be the basis of the infrastructure design for the shared services and this will help drive energy efficiency for our green data centers of the future Because a private cloud is exclusive in nature and limited in access to a set of participants, it has inherent strengths with respect to security and control over data.  Also, the private cloud approach can provide advantages with respect to adherence to corporate and regulatory compliance guidelines These considerations for a private cloud are very significant for most large organizations IV  W AYS TO P ROMOTE G REEN I NITIATIVES  If You Can\222t Measure It, You Can\222t Manage It\224     \(Quote attributed to many, including W. E. Deming and Peter Drucker\. In order to measure green IT, we must have standards as to what constitutes green IT.  The standards are IT energy-use metrics.  In addition to measurements for IT energy use, there are also the measurements for green buildings, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED\reen Building Rating System, developed by the U.S Green Building Council \(USGBC\.  LEED provides a suite of standards for environmentally sustainable construction. LEED does not relate directly to green data centers, but rather to the overall building Another metric for green IT is EPEAT, the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool.  EPEAT was created through an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE\ council because companies and government agencies wanted to put green criteria in IT requests for proposals EPEAT got a big boost in January 2007 when President Bush signed an executive order requiring that 95% of electronic products procured by federal agencies meet EPEAT standards as long there's a standard for that product. First, however, we\222ll look at some standards and metrics specifically developed for measuring IT and data center energy efficiency, such as SPEC marks and the metrics being developed by the EPA. The EPA is pushing for metrics for all aspects of data center use and the EPA metrics should be the guideline for green data centers The Standard Performance Evaluation Corp. \(SPEC benchmark information has been used for years to compare servers from a power aspect. In the author\222s experience companies are very interested in SPEC marks when comparing new servers. Customers use the SPEC marks in order to compare relative power.  Here's the SPEC homepage http://www.spec.org In 2008 SPEC started a benchmark to compare the power consumed by a server with its performance - a metric designed to aid users in boosting data center efficiency A  Energy-Use Dashboards at Montpelier, France The demo data center in Montpelier, France is called the PSSC \(Products and Solutions Support Center\reen Data Center of the Future [5 T h e m ain id ea  w as  t o cr eat e a customer friendly real-time green showcase production data center that will demonstrate a large percentage of the currently available best practices in IT and facilities energy conservation integrating at least one bleeding-edge major conservation technology. The information on the use of a live camera thermal camera, and green IT energy use real-time dashboards available to IT personnel through a portal are interesting innovations that can help communicate the energy efficiency of the data center to all interested employees The Power Usage Effectiveness \(PUE\ the metric used to measure the energy efficiency of a data center. Both IT and non-IT resources\222 energy consumption are gathered. Two PUEs are measured: overall and high-density zone For demo purposes you can show in real time the PUE of the PSSC Green Data Center.  Although the PSSC green data center is for demo purposes, these energy use dashboards would be useful for any data center to raise company awareness on IT energy efficiency. These dashboards remind me of the real time gas mileage graphics on the Toyota Prius automobile I recently rented. The graphics on the Prius\222 dashboard constantly reminded me that I was getting around 42 miles per gallon and informed me when the car was using the electric motor and when it was using the gas engine \(and charging the battery\.  The data center energy use dashboard for the Montpelier demo center is shown in Figure 4   Figure 4  Montpelier PSSC Green Data Center Energy Use Dashboard \(Source: IBM Montpelier PSSC Green Data Center Team B  Smartbank \226 Smart Green Infrastructure Monitoring at the Solution Level Monitoring at can be done at the Solution Level Smartbank is a live showcase involving many platforms. For demo purpose, the monitoring of an entire solution can be demonstrated.  Active Energy Manager is implemented for the energy management of z10 and Blades.  The Smartbank solution level monitoring is shown in Figure 5. As stated for the previous dashboard, these data center energy dashboards can communicate current energy efficiency to interested IT team members just as the hybrid automobiles constantly remind the driver with dashboard gas mileage graphics. The real-time dashboard can give the IT team immediate feedback on how data center energy management techniques impact

These technologies area all part of the Smart Green Infrastructure strategy 200  SSDs \(Solid State Drives\ve no moving parts and don\222t get hot, which means they are quieter and don\222t require much cooling. They also use less space, which impacts how much data center real estate is needed. The Storage Networking Industries Association \(SNIA\ estimates that 13 percent of the total power consumption in a data center comes from storage. So SSDs can be a significant contributor to a green data center 200  Agile development methods can greatly increase application development efficiency and save energy 200  Mobile access and predictive analytics \(including big data and Hadoop technologies\ only increase flexibility in IT but also contribute to overall IT energy efficiency [4  VI  PRIVATE CLOUD CASE STUDIES FOR THE SMART GREEN INFRASTRUCTUE  This section describes the significant advantages of using a cloud for test and development environments A  Computing and Private vs. Public Clouds Cloud computing [1 i s a s t y l e  o f  IT de l i ve r y  i n  w h i c h  applications, data, and IT resources are rapidly provisioned and provided as standardized offerings to users over the web in a flexible pricing model. The resources are provisioned \223on demand\224 A cloud computing platform dynamically provisions configures, reconfigures, and deprovisions servers as needed Servers in the cloud can be physical machines or virtual machines. Clouds can also manage other computing resources such as storage area networks \(SANs\ and network equipment A public cloud \(external cloud\ describes cloud computing in the traditional main-stream sense, whereby resources are dynamically provisioned on a fine-grained, self-service basis over the Internet Private clouds describe offerings that emulate cloud computing on private networks. These \(typically virtualization automation\ products offer the ability to host applications or virtual machines in a company's own set of hosts. Enhanced security is a major benefit provided by private clouds B  Cloud Considerations Here is information from IBM\222s Systems Engineering Architecture and Test \(SEA&T\ team members on how cloud helps improve testing efficiency 200  For performance testing, our teams can test in a wide variety of test environments, ranging from a development environment, to an integration test environment, to a customer hosted environment 200  If testing occurs in an integration test environment, the normal process involves engaging the IBM Test team on a planning/technical call, then to determine when the environment would be needed and built, and also what kind of server HW/SW \(hardware/software\ and configuration is needed \(number of processors, memory needed, storage needed, software needed, etc., present significant challenges without use of cloud technology One of the primary challenges is to test on a production like environment to ensure that test results are predictive of production performance 200  Depending on schedule and resources available, the time for provisioning and setup of servers could take anywhere from several days to several weeks \(resolving schedule challenges is a significant benefit of moving to cloud 


200  Once servers are provisioned and assigned to the project additional time is needed for application install. This also presents a possible set of challenges.  Normally application teams do not have direct access to the servers and must provide install files and instructions.  Cloud technology can be used to automate this process 200  Breakdown and reuse of servers - Normally, after a project completes, servers are "broken down" and reprovisioned for use by other projects or applications.  A cloud automates this breakdown and reuse process C  Example Case Study: Private Test/Dev Cloud for Cell Phone Company This case study is based on the author\222s experience working with a cell phone company in South Africa on ways to improve efficiency of their IT environment. At that time the cell phone company was experiencing very typical concerns for large companies with their test and development environments.  The concerns included 200  Test environment resource availability.  This was for both hardware and people resource, especially in an end to end testing environment 200  There was no good scheduling process for shared resources 200  There was significant amounts of test server waste due to lack of governance and management \226 for example every project gets servers for testing and the servers were often not released when testing is completed  A detailed spreadsheet was developed to determine the projected financial benefit from the use of a private cloud. The spreadsheet indicated projected server and labor resource savings due to use of a private cloud for test and development servers.  The projections indicated that when 280 application test/dev environments were moved to a private cloud, the number of servers could be reduced by 62%.  The time \(days to provision the test environments would be reduced from 33 days to 5.4 days and the number of test team members needed to provision the test environments would go from 16 team members to 2 team members  The cloud estimations spreadsheet described above proved to be a good way to present savings due to the use of cloud for test/dev.  Much of the projected savings was due to reduced labor \(i.e. testers\.  Overall, a private cloud provides a way to greatly improve test and development environments for 1\ Speed in setting up test environments 2\aving hardware, software, and labor for testing The cloud is an excellent environment for test and development environments.  The trend to use cloud first for test and development environments is a worldwide phenomenon.  Cloud allows for automation, efficiency, and energy savings B ecau s e of th e d y n a m i c as pect of IT  w e  have already made significant progress with cloud computing and can build on that past  For success with cloud test and development environments strong governance, scheduling and management of the systems are required VII  C ONCLUSIONS  The discussion on the Smart Green Infrastructure in this paper focused on the importance and techniques that can be used to significantly improve energy efficiency at data centers and at the same time automate the process. Cloud Technology is key for both energy efficiency and automation. All of our studies and implementation have indicated the great benefits of cloud technology for test and development environments  Innovation at data centers for energy efficiency and automation has been especially active within IBM at the PSSC demo data centers around the world and at the IBM CIO Lab\222s Innovation data centers. The innovations include measuring the energy efficiency and automation improvements with the use of mobile, analytics, cloud computing, and smart monitoring for the applications on an agile platform  Going forward, we all have a role in data center and IT energy and cost efficiency and can help save the planet A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The authors acknowledge the significant contributions from IBM SEA&T \(Systems Engineering, Architecture, and Test The IBM CIO group provided valuable \223lessons learned\224 on implementing smart green infrastructure at IBM\222s internal data centers.

the shore and if the cellular system does not take into account to optimize its coverage extension to the sea the involvement of the satellite network will increase the cost associated to this network Another drawback of IWMCN is when a connection needs to be established for ship-to-ship communications and when the mobile user is not located within VANET then how the IWMCN will handle the selection of the communications link D MaritimeManet A distributed surveillance application can be deployed in MaritimeManet network which provides uninterrupted surveillance over a large maritime area of responsibility AoR The distributed surveillance application called sensors in concert SiC has been developed due to the inefÞcient and expensive existing maritime surface surveillance using satellites maritime petroleum aerial vehicles or multiple navy vessels SiC nodes create SiC systems each node senses its surroundings up to  km using radar automatic identiÞcation system optionally equipment operator EO and passive sonar to communicate with its neighboring nodes to exchange sensor data and integrates its own sensor data with the other received sensors data using MaritimeManet SiC nodes can be conveyed over buoys relatively small navy vessels unmanned surface vehicles USV commercial ships or oil rigs SiC nodes should be placed at sufÞcient height so that the optical horizon complements the sensing range to achieve suitable spatial deployment which results in continuous and full coverage of area-of-responsibility AoR even when islands exist To enable SiC maritime nodes should be able to communicate in an ad-hoc network manner The underlining protocol of SiC nodes operates in three parts The distribution middleware sub-system transport layer the ad-hoc IP MANET SSM DiffServ sub-system network layer and the transmission sub-system data link and physical layers A publish-subscriber data-oriented distribution middleware provides interconnection between different application processes In the network layer an ad-hoc routing protocol is used jointly with other IP forwarding capabilities such as protocol independent multi-casting with source speciÞc multicast PIM-SSM and differentiated services DiffServ With a novel approach of neighbors discovery LOS communications between nodes relies on multi-beam antennas For beyond line-of-sight BLOS communications an alternative wireless technology based on HF and near vertical indices skywave NVIS antenna is used when LOS is not supporting a connected network The ad-hoc routing protocol will be deÞned by one of the available routing protocols of MANET Obviously nodes are located on surface platforms with fairly moderate speed and non rapid changes in the network typology To optimize routing protocol modiÞcations have to be applied to a proactive protocol such as open link state routing OLSR In MaritimeManet each node transmits data to the nodes when they need it The coordination and forwarding methods for data transmission can be conÞgured using existing IP capabilities  In the d istrib ution m iddle w are a node publishes its data types deÞned by data model and irrespective of the designed system to other nodes which can show interest in one or more of them The source-speciÞc multi-cast SSM  is the bearer for data dissemination where a unique data delivery channel is created by the IP-address of the source and the group addresses Also data types are uniquely mapped to group addresses DeÞciency arises as this method operates well only in systems with multiple nodes having the same capabilities such as SiC despite that SSM uses multicast forwarding which is utilized for communications sessions between two nodes SSM must be acti v ated in the netw o rk in order to use the source address and the group addresses channels Therefore internet group management protocol IGMP is essential to permit nodes to join and receive packets from a certain channel The delivery tree for the group addresses will be formulated by SSM routing protocol In order to use the channel multicast forwarding is needed to exchange data By using SSM in state of the ordinary multicast where any node can send to a multicast group avoids the exploitation of complex multi-cast routing In SSM unicast routing protocol is adequate In MaritimeManet the loss and delay values for speciÞc data types service quality that can be tolerated for each data type are achieved during forwarding in the network Based on the control bits in the packet header DiffServ allows controlling over the buffering of packets Prior to the packet forwarding over the network a node maps the indicated loss and delay values to the best matching forwarding service and sets the controlling bit in the header The control bits deal with the delay and discard priorities of the packet During the transmission of the packet at each intermediate node the control bits decide how packets are treated in the queue By doing this simple and efÞcient service differentiation is achieved with applications while guaranteeing their QoS requirements IV C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE D IRECTION In this paper we have discussed the wireless communications technologies for building reliable maritime mesh networks while outlining the challenges and requirements for guaranteeing high quality maritime wireless mesh communications The presented maritime communications networks and systems provide ubiquitous maritime applications by integrating and expanding the terrestrial network with/to the maritime environment This research study classiÞes the research work which has been done so far on maritime wireless mesh networks deployment and technologies Generally a maritime communications network should maintain backward compatibility with satellite and other maritime radio communications to provide seamless handover in case of any network disruption or failure As a next step in our research work we will be working on multi-hop routing for maritime wireless mesh networks with the aim to improve the transmission speed and reduce the cost of maritime communications

The performance of BFS and triangle counting are dependent on topological properties of the graph For BFS the performance is dependent on the diameter the longest shortest-path of the graph Using the Small World graph vs traditional 1D partitioning we show the weak scaling of both with BFS on RMAT graphs on BG/P in Figure 12 Because 1D partitioning suffers from data imbalance the graph sizes in the experiments were reduced to prevent 1D from running out of memory The weak scaling of edge list partitioning is almost linear while 
vertices twice the size as experiments on BG/P Intrepid We expect our approach to continue scaling as larger HPC clusters with node-local NVRAM become available To experiment with the effects of increasing NVRAM usage per compute node we performed an experiment where the computational resources are held constant while the data size increases The results of our data scaling experiment are shown in Figure 9 As the data size increases from 34 billion to 1 trillion edges 10.8 TB the additional data we store on NVRAM results in only a moderate performance reduction The overall performance reduction from DRAMonly to 32x larger graph stored in NVRAM is only 39 This is a signicant increase in data size with only a moderate performance degradation Results using our distributed external memory BFS for the Graph500 are shown in Table II In addition to the HyperionDIT cluster we performed experiments on Trestles at the San Diego Supercomputing Center SDSC and Leviathan LLNL Each compute node in Trestles has commodity SATA SSDs and shows that our approach is not limited to enterprise class NVRAM Leviathan is a single-node system using implementations from our previous multithreaded work  4  Le viathan has 1TB of DRAM and 12TB of Fusion-io in a single host These represent 3 of 8 total systems on the November 2011 Graph500 list traversing trillion-edge graphs To demonstrate the effects of

vertices and undirected edges We performed a weak scaling study in which each compute node stores 17 billion edges on its local NVRAM roughly 169GB in a compressed sparse row format The results of the weak scaling are shown in Figure 8 at 64 compute nodes the graph has over one trillion undirected edges and probabilities shown above each datapoint Maximum vertex degree used for x-axis Computational resources xed at 4096 cores of BG/P Graph size is xed at vertices and 
vertices and undirected edges undirected edges per core generator we show the effects of increasing diameter on BFS in Figure 10 By decreasing the small-world random rewire probability while keeping the size of the graph constant the diameter of the graph increases The increasing diameter causes the performance of BFS to decrease Similarly the performance of triangle counting is dependent on the maximum vertex degree Using the Preferential Attachment graph generator with an added step of random rewire we show the effects of increasing hub degree while keeping the graph size constant in Figure 11 The topological effects can also be seen in the algorithm analysis in Sections VI-D 1 and VI-D 3

We experimented with the effects on BFS performance of choosing different size on a graph with vertices on 4096 cores of BG/P The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 13 where the percent improvement of ghosts per partition vs no ghosts is shown Using a single ghost shows more than a 12 improvement and 512 ghosts shows an 19.5 improvement This improvement is highly dependent on the graph and as hubs grow to larger sizes it may have a larger effect For scale-free graphs when  there is an opportunity for ghosts to have a positive effect because at least one partition will have multiple edges to  where is the number of distributed partitions and is the graph For the sparse Graph500 datasets with average degree of 16 this may occur for as low as 256 partitions and is independent of graph size Second under weak scaling the amount of algorithm state e.g BFS level stored per partition scales with  where is the total number of vertices This will ultimately hit a scaling wall where the amount of local algorithm state per partition exceeds the capacity of the compute node Finally with respect to our desire to use semi-external memory where the vertex set is stored in in-memory and the edge set is stored in external memory hypersparse partitions are poor candidates to apply semi-external memory techniques because the in-memory requirements proportional to the number of vertices are larger than the external memory requirements proportional to the number of edges Our has been explored by Willcock  20  Acti v e messages are routed through a synthetic network to improve dense communication scalability A key difference to our work is that their approach has been designed for the Bulk Synchronous Parallel BSP model and is not suitable for asynchronous graph traversals The STAPL Graph Library  21  pro vides a frame w ork that abstracts the user from data-distribution and parallelism and supports asynchronous algorithms to be expressed 
Recent work using 2D graph partitioning has shown the best results for traditional large scale HPC systems  3   10   11  Ho we v er  it has serious disadv antages at scale and with external memory First when processing sparse graphs each 2D block may become hypersparse i.e fewer edges than vertices per partition  19  Specically  partitions become hypersparse when
