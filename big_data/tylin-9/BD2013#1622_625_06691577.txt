The equivalent tensor form of a concept tree can be described as a large table of terms and coefficients where the terms represent distinct concepts called basis-vectors  coefficients represent the relative impor tance of each concept in the tensor. For the purposes of this paper we assume that the basis-vectors are represented in their 64-bit MD5 Hash forms and the coefficient is a 32-bit number.

They are generally characterised by short parallel paths/threads with a small memory footprint, irregular, unpredictable memory access requirements The need for a reconfigurable processor occurs because the same processing units can be reused to execute a different phase of the computation, while sharing the same interconnect network and conserving die area It is possible to design specialized functional units \(SFU\ithin a reconfigurable processing element \(RPE eby providing both coarse and fine-grained parallelism required by an application. Several big-data applications may not require reuse of data, so cache memories and branch prediction logic is unnecessary. A simple memory hierarchy which allows cores/RPEs to issue multiple outstanding memory access requests to off-chip memory is advantageous  Fig. 4  Reconfigurable hardware architecture template for data-intensive algorithms The overall architecture of the reconfigurable computing solution is illustrated at a high level in Fig. 4. It comprises of an execution controller EC\, multiple reconfigurable processing elements RPEs\o distinct inte rconnection networks : corecore and memory-core.

In this paper, we use a cross-bar interconnect Two distinct interconnection networks are specified because the memory-core load and core-core loads are application dependent. The memory-core interconnect network links the RPE’s to r off-chip memory banks. These memory banks may be filled in using the DMA controller independent of processor interaction. The EC manages the operations of the RPE’s including orchestrating initiali zation, task assignment synchronisation; it also provides an interface to the host CPU processor. A group of RPE’s can also have shared memory accessible to more than one RPE. Each RPE is capable of independently reading and writing from/to its memory bank based on the configuration data sent to it as a bus-master The following section describes how we parallelized the SIF algorithm using the above reconfigurable architecture template.

In particular, we have chosen ARM Cortex A9 as the low-power RISC processor When designed with TSMC’s 65nm generic process, it can be clocked at 1 GHz and consume 250mW. The rest of the figure describes the RPE matrix with 128 elements \(RPE0-RPE128 configuration instructions vi a an execution controller. The RPE’s have been designed to use the AM of the few signals necessary and limited I/O needs. The execution controller has  an AM  which are translated into the APB domain using an AXI to  ists of two AXI Master ports which are connected via two interconnects \(Memory-Core CAM-Core\ and CAM banks respectively. A separate p bit bus from each RPE feeds into a separate RPE-Sync block on the SoC. Each of the components and rationale for designing them is explained in the subsections below. In the following description BURSTx_READ and BURSTx_WRITE refer to AXI transactions which read or write x bytes in a single transaction respectively   Fig. 5  Proposed reconfigurable SoC architecture for SIF  A  Role of the host processor \(ARM Cortex A9 The host processor orchestrates the entire operation of the SoC, partitions and loads data into the memory units, delegates and responds to interrupts from the Execution Controller \(EC and performs the final sum operation.

Its three key operations are summarized below 1. Configuration & monito ring for BF set phase The EC sends the following configuration registers to the RPE  read_start_address 1  num_data 1  operation_id  for where to read t 1i s from, how many entries to read and operation_id=32’h1 This is performed as a BURST3_WRITE  transaction from AXI_Master ports on the EC AXI to APB Bridge RPE’s APB slave port. The execution controller also receives a completion signal \(32 bit, equal to operation_id  from the RPE’s once the BF set phase is complete. On receiving this signal, the EC proceeds to stage 2 2. Configuration & monitoring of BF test phase The EC sends the following config. registers to the RPE  read_start_address 2  num_data 2  CAM_address  core_id  operation_id  that read_start_address and num_data now represent from where the RPE would read t 2j c 2j  would read. The operation_id 32’h2 The EC waits for the completion signal line from the core to learn that the BF test phase is complete and proceed to stage 3 3. Retrive SUM, generate interrupt The BF set phase will execute concurrently on all RPE’s unless there is a interconnect bottleneck. However, the BF test phase on the RPE’s will run asynchronously because it is data-dependent. If a particular RPE has a large number of potential matches  test_success=1 ill wait on the CAM units longer to return the corresponding coefficient\(s  c 1m s in line 10 of Algorithm 1 RPE’s will terminate at different times and will in that order inform the EC.

C  Design of the RPE  Fig. 6  Reconfigurable Processing element \(RPE Fig. 6 presents a schematic overview of each RPE. Each RPE executes 5 distinct operations as part of two phases set  and test During the set phase, stages 1,2 & 3 are executed serially whereas during the test phase stages 1,2,4 and 5 are executed serially. Configuration instructions dispatched from the EC are stored in 32-bit c onfiguration registers. These configuration registers drive th e RPE state machine. Memory read requests to the memory banks are issued via the read channel of an AXI master subcomponent. We use a BURST16_READ in the increment mode for highest throughput. Once a basis_vector term is received, it is passed onto stage 2 to generate the required k Bloom Filter indices BFI k is 22 bits long \(corresponding to the bitaddress of a m 2 22 4Mi wide BF bit-vector\e use k=7  indices per basis_vector term, which corresponds to a BF_Address bus p 154-bits wide. A BF_Address line for every core is routed externally to a BF-Sync module \(described subsequently\loom filter The test phase proceeds in an analogous manner. In this phase however, each core is expected to read both the  basis_vector,coefficient c 2j  Tensor 2 allocated to it. The key difference being that once the BFI k bits  for the test basis_vector are generated, they are now tested for prescence in the BF. When Test_success is a true shown as an input from the RPE_Sync module automatically triggers a lookup for the corresponding coefficient of Tensor 1 lines 8-11 of Algorithm 1 operation is issued by the RPE from its second AXI Master port as a BURST1_READ on a 128-bit address. The lower 10bits of the 128-bit address are us ed to identify the cores identity  coreID  basis_vector of the candidate match.

A subsequent XOR ope ration with these 0’s would retain the previous value, several bit-positions would become deteministic; thereby reducing the effecitveness of the bloom filter indices.  In contrast a cicular rotation operation preserves the entropy in the original data. Further, bit-wise XOR has a significantly lower power draw than an adder; hence method 5 was chosen as the preferred method to generate BFI k  2  Design of the RPE-Sync module  Fig. 7  Construction of the RPE-Sync module Fig. 7 shows the internal construction of the RPE-Sync module.

Workload specific accelerators are expected soon. Workload specific accelerators for Big-Data will need to be software reconfi gurable to be applicable to a wide array of similar applications, provide extra-oridinary energy savings and high-performance to be a compelling alternative. In this paper, we described a novel software reconfigurable computing architect ure for efficient and scalable semantic information filtering.
