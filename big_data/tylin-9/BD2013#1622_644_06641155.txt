The original JDL model focused on the data fusion \(correlation, filtering, and association\ issues, while today there is an increasing emphasis on an integrated approach to information exploitation over sensors, users, and missions using enterprise architectures, interope rability standards, and intelligence to the edge. Given these recent changes to computation and distributed access, we examine wa ys for extending the JDL model from 1998 to support exploitation functions and information management for situation awaren ess, massive data analytics for contextual awareness, and doma in-specific needs for mission awareness Keywords JDL model, enterprise ar chitectures, data fusion information management, contextual reasoning  I  I NTRODUCTION  This paper is meant to serve as a re-examination of the use of the Joint Directors of Laboratories \(JDL\ model [1, 2, 3, 4  to meet the needs for fusion pr ocessing that is responsive to new technologies of big data, cloud computing, and machine analytics. The inception of the original JDL Data Fusion model aimed at providing a process flow for sensor and data fusion   Su bse que nt re vi s i ons were m a de i n  19 9 8  2  t o  incorporate new understanding of the issues involved in exploiting information for diverse purposes such as impacts versus threats and process refinement versus sensor management. There also were needs to clarify terms, broaden the model from its initial focus on tactical military applications, and apply to different users [3  W i t h t h e establishment of the International Society of Information Fusion \(ISIF\ notion of 223information\224 became an important concept in IF designs and analysis. In 2004, the JDL model was revised as per the issues discussed from the working group [4  At t h e sam e t i m e fr om t h e wo r k i ng group, there was the proposed Data Fusion Information Group DFIG\odel, which included suggested updates from the constituent member discussions such as a focus on user functions [6  The f o c u sed a ppl i cat i o n of t h i s  pa per  deal s wi t h  information exploitation of distributed multimedia content which requires revisions of the JDL model for machine analytics, information management, and user contextual reasoning over enterprise applications Since the 1990 book of Multisensor Data Fusion 7 e process flow for \223fusion\224 has been about the same. However with the popularity of the web and the formation of ISIF www.isif.org\, new developments have resulted from information exploitation and \223management\224  These  developments affect the existing models. An accepted modeling distinction has been made between high-level information fusion \(HLIF\ and low-level information fusion LLIF\ich was first described in e low-lev e l functional processes support target classification identification, and tracking, while high-level functional processes support situation, impact, and fusion process assessment. LLIF concerns numerical data \(e.g., target locations, kinematics, and attribute types\. HLIF concerns abstract symbolic information \(e.g., threat, intent, and goals  Ove r the last decade, t h ere have been numerous panel discussions on HLIF that de monstrate the ever changing issues in systems-level inform ation fusion [1 Som e  re cent systems issues include new methods for evidential reasoning  n ess logic  rprise a r c h itectures 1 i n t e rface  m a nagem e nt 14  an d di st ri but e d a r chi t ect ures  15  A co m p lete list o f in terestin g m o d i ficatio n s t o t h e u s e of the JDL functional model can be found in hundreds of papers in the ISIF conferences The focus of the paper is aimed at those who are building information fusion systems that support information exploitation \(InfoEx\. InfoEx from many sensors and users distributed across a variety of loca tions requires a revisit to the JDL model for system-based applications. For a closed-loop sensor system, the tenets of the original JDL process flow are applicable with real-world parameters \(e.g., a Kalman Filter For InfoEx systems, which are envisaged to have multiple users, data sources, intelligence data collections, missions, and different users, the JDL model can be used for guidance, but has to be adapted to meet these needs. A large-scale system is difficult to comprehensively model, and thus, provides a notional representation of the process flows across parameters and conditions as done in [4  The key goal of [4 was t o cl ari f y  defi ni t i on of t e rm s and  establish a clear and generalized basis for the JDL model. It defined data fusion as 'the process of combining multiple pieces of data to estimate the state of some aspect of the world. Partitioning into data fusion "levels" was stated in terms of the types of such asp ects: L0: features, L1: individual 129 16th International Conference on Information Fusion\r\nIstanbul, Turkey,\ July 9-12, 2013\r\n 978-605-86311-1-3 Ó2013 ISIF 


entities, L2: structures \(e.g., relationships and situations scenarios and outcomes, and L4 aspects of the system itself Sensor and other information management functions were partitioned into a series of analogous levels. The model is a functional model and therefore agnostic as to whether implementation of any of these functions is by people or automated processes [2 Ex tend ing t h e JDL m o d e l to  encompass resource management with data fusion supports functions of problem-solving under uncertainty. System designers and process managers may want a tight integration of diverse fusion, data mining, adaptive modeling, sensing and diverse resource management processes Information exploitation considers the utility of information probability of acquiring such information via candidate action plans and costs of plans, all of which are time-dependent utility and cost are also user variables\Ex involves considerations of the characte rization and representation of utility and cost, multi-agent and multi-user systems, and adaptive management and adaptive context exploitation Steinberg states [16  Context provides expectations, constr ains processing, and can infer or refine desired information \(\223problem variables\224\the basis of other available information \(\223context variables\224  A key issue of utilizing context relates to the original distinction of low-level information fusion \(LLIF\ Highlevel Information Fusion \(HLIF\.

For example the user requires different tasks utilizing various skills perception\rules \(tasks\d cognition \(knowledge\[20  Also, many fusion systems are designed to meet a specific mission. Thus, the Level 5/6 are distinct as to represent the different interactions, tailor the information fusion design to different systems, and address the advancements in the use of information fusion by the general community. However, there are practical limitations to the DFIG model Limitation 1 The L1 \(explicit machine fusion\/3 \(implicit machine fusion\ and interface to human \(L5\ are not unique Processes at any of these levels can include explicit, implicit human or machine approaches [6 A b e tter d i stin ctio n th an explicit/implicit is between \(1 filtering/refinement which converts an input estimate of a random variable to a more accurate or less uncertain estima te of that variable, and \(2 inference/abstraction which estimates \(frequently latent variables from those available as inputs Limitation 2 From Fig. 1, the choice to combine L2/L3 based on common functions needs to be separated based on variables extracted for exploitation. Distinguishing \(L1, L2, L3\ata fusion functions \(blocks\ and \(L0, L4, L5, L6\ource management functions \(interfaces does not characterize that these blocks and interfaces represent fusion and control exploitation processes. For example, cognitive reasoning \(L5 to constrain control could also be evidential reasoning \(L2\ for fusion. Planning, typical done by humans through automation is now afforded through autonomy with enterprise resources Finally, the platform of sensors and ground stations should encompass other enterprise resources \(e.g., World Wide Web with varying degrees of controllability over not just the implied physical \223real world\224 but perhaps the \223external universe of discourse\224 to cover virtual realities Major suggestions since the 2004 revisions are the focus on information management, advanced visualizations, data mining, and mission focus with teams, priorities, and coordination. All of these functions help to establish context  for the HLIF unsolved issues of fusion and resource management. For example, RM can be aided by information management enterprise computing \(aspects of data acquisition access, recall, and st orage services The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect.

A  Information Fusion Modeling in the Enterprise The current trends in information fusion \(IF\ are data mining  enterprise architectures and communications 21  D iff eren t mission applications require coordination over \(1\ data models, storage/accesses control, and process and transport flow, \(2\architectures: \(e.g. serv ice-oriented architecture\, and 3\he enterprise \(e.g. servi ce bus, computing environment and the cloud\Fig. 2 highlights the needs of the user elements of data mining  and dat a  fl o w i n t h e ent e rp ri s e   Information exploitation involves two processes \(1 integrating and managing the data, and \(2\analyzing the data through IF and data mining. The JDL model deals only with part of data analysis as IF. Services and clouds can deal with the implementation of these two st eps as represented in Fig. 2    Figure 2 \226 Information Fusion Enterprise Model \(Adapted from    Context is both input and output of data analysis. For example context \(e.g., terrain and backgro und traffic\ is used to support fusion \(e.g., finding usual behavior\d at the same time is the output of fusion \(e.g., terrain from fusing video\ Recently Solano and Jernigan [1 pre s ent e d a n ent e rp ri se arc h i t ect ure  to manage intelligence products for mission objectives highlighting data formats \(e.g., schemas, unstructured, and metadata\es \(e.g., access, ingest, cleansing profiling, and ontology workflows\and database management services \(DBMS\DB resources include contextual information such as terrain models.

There are several means by which this can be accomplished 200  Reducing barriers to effective information use by providing notification, mediation, access c ontrol, and persistence services 200  Providing an information space wh erein information is managed directly, rather than delegating IM responsibilities to applications that produce and consume information 200  Focusing on consumer needs rather than producer preferences to ensure that information can be effectively presented and used 200  Providing tools to assess informa tion quality and suitability 200  Exploiting producer-provided char acterization of information to support automated management a nd dissemination of information   and  200  Tools for goal-driven search discovery and exploitation of information to meet dyna mic information needs  Optimal users\222 ability/effectiveness achieved by any of these means can make applications  less complicated and enables the enterprise to be more agile to adapt to changing requirements and environments There are several best practices that help achieve the goals of information management. Organizations will greatly improve the interoperability and agility of their future net-centric information fusion \(and command and control\ systems by 1  Adopting dedicated information mana gement infrastructures \(e.g cloud computing 2  223Packaging\224 information for di ssemination and management 3  Creating simple, ubiquitous services that are independent of operating system and programming language 4  Using a common syntax and semantics for common information attributes such as location, time, and subject; and 5  Adopting interfaces among producers, consumers and brokers that are simple, effective and well-documented If appropriately employed, these best practices can reduce the complexity of information fusion systems, allow for effective control of the information space, and facilitate more effective sharing of information over an enterprise environment Fig. 3 presents an IM model which illustrates the extended relation of the actors coordinating through the enterprise with the various layers and inner circles providing the protocol for information service access and dissemi  Figure 3 \226 Information Management \(IM\ Model People or autonomous agents interact with the managed information enterprise environment by producing and consuming information or by managing it. Various actors and their activities/services within an IM enterprise surround the IM model that transforms data into information. Within the IM model, there are various services that are needed to process the managed information objects \(MIOs A set of service layers are defi ned that use artifacts to perform specific services.

Three issues that have been addressed as inherent at each level are 200  Uncertainty management through contextual awareness  and particularly, mana gement of second-order uncertainly. This involves issues of source charact erization \(particularly with human sources\ representation of diverse flavors of uncertainty as well as computational issues e.g. in PHD-based methods  28, 29, 30 200  Adaptive context exploitation  considering the utility of information, probability of acquiring such information via candidate action plans and costs of plans, all of which are timevariable \(utility and cost are al so user-variable\ involves considerations analogous to the above: consistent characterization and representation of utility and cost Additional factors include multi-agent and multi-user systems Aspects of this problem are the integration of fusion, mining and general problem solving methods adaptive process, model, and goal management, and adapti ve context exploitation 31  200  Methods of user involvement through contextualization  to include the interface and control issues for specific tasks that are operationally divided amongst different users such as information collection, real-time control, forensic analysis, and visualizations. These functions are local functions distributed over a large team for specific tasks versus a single user that is responsible for the entire information fusion syst    The JDL variations of the Signals, Feature, Decision \(SFD Model  D F R M  no de a r c h i t ect ure 2   t h e User Fusion Model \(UFM Tran sf orm a t i on of  R e q u i r em ent s  for Information Process \(TRIP\odel [3 an d St at eTransition Data Fusion \(S TDF o mm on processes across many levels and a more robust way of implementation by re-use of data and methods to serve different purposes. The method of context has also been a subject of these model developments and variations that have influenced developers using the JDL as a framework for implementation. For the DF/RM model, context is divided into those elements that support data fusion \(L0-3\, and those for management \(L4\. An example is terrain information in which tracking can be adapted to road information and sensors can be managed as related to zones of authorized operation. The TRIP model divides the problem into demand conditioning L4-6\ and supply conditioning \(L0-3\The demand/supply duality is meant to serve users requesting information and the system determining if these requests can be answered. For demand conditioning, decision, exploitation, and observability context are used to decompose the user request into machine functions \(i.e., fusion\hat can be processed.  The  UFM seeks to utilize the users cognitive requ ests \(L5-6\n establishing context in their coordination of the fusion levels \(L0-4 Finally, the STDF utilizes the same control \(L4-6\ over different functions such as physics-derived \(e.g. radar\ \(L0-1 human-derived \(e.g. text\ \(L 0-1\, situations, \(L3\, and scenarios \(L4\ key attribut es of these JDL variants are inherent in establishing different methods of fusion and control with common issues described at each level The future of the use of JDL will require developments in uncertainty analysis, exploitation, and user involvement based on the context, such as mission management \(L6\. While these related models \(SDF, UFM, TR IP, DF/RM, STDF\e elements of context, they also try to solve real problems for real users. Hence, a current tren d in information processing is 132 


machine analytics that seeks methods of data compression and presentation for user interaction III  M ACHINE A NALYTICS  In the JDL model revisits in 2004, little attention was paid the enormous amount of types of data \(e.g. email and sensor distributed locations, and various connections to different applications \(e.g. finance to surveillance\hat have resulted from the expansion of the World-Wide Web. Related concepts recently emerging are machine descriptive, prescriptive predictive, visual, and other analytics yet to be coined. There are three issues of importance hardware e.g., Apache Hadoop data intensive distributed architecture software e.g., machine analytics\nd user/domain applications \(e.g. visual analytics text analytics\ce the JDL is a functional model, we will focus on the last two. Data Mining \(DM\ and data fusion \(DF are analysis functions supported by machines A  Modeling Analytics The commercial business industry has been managing large volumes of transactional data us ing powerful databases systems and, most recently, using cl oud infrastructures. Traditional business analytics has focused mo stly on descriptive analyses of structured historical data using statistical techniques. The current trend in DM is towards predictive  analytics of unstructured data such as documents, video, image sets multimedia data, network data, matrices, tensors, and graphs and tensors [38 The fi el d of dat a fusi on 3 9  has been m a k i ng use of cutting edge Artificial Intelligence \(AI\d Machine Learning \(ML\ techniques to perform situation and threat assessments. Given that analytics and data fusion are two sides of the same coin, an effective revision of the JDL model warrants a close cooperation between the two communities in terms of technology enrichment for managing and intelligent processing of large volumes of data. The model extensions should be able to seamlessly exploit such enriched technologies in areas such as massive data an alytics, hybrid reasoning, text analytics, and distributed processing Traditional statistical approaches are invaluable in data-rich environments, but there are areas where AI and ML approaches provide better analyses, especially where there is an abundance of subjective knowledge. Benefits of such augmentation include mixing of numerical and categorical variables in algorithms, \223what-if\224 or expl anation-based reasoning explainable results of inferences easily understood by human analysts, and efficiency enhanc ement incorporating knowledge from domain experts as heuristics to deal with the \223curse of dimensionality\224. Though early AI reasoning was primarily symbolic in nature \(i.e., manipulation of linguistics symbols with well-defined semantics\it has moved towards a hybrid of symbolic and numerical, and ther efore one is expected to find probabilistic and statistical founda tions in many AI approaches Conversely, business analytic s traditionally has powerful customer or other related segmentation techniques via various powerful clustering algorithms such k-means, hierarchical clustering and k- nearest neighbor. Table 2 depicts some of the well-known techniques categorized along the statistics, AI and ML paradigms along with a special category for temporal reasoning given the dynamic nature of analytics and fusion problems. Here are some examples of augmentation and enrichment of business analytics 200  Meld regression analyses with probabilistic graphical modeling  200  Augment \223nearest-neighbor\224 and k means clustering techniques with support vector machines and neural networks   Table 2 Approaches to Modeling Analytics Paradigm Approach Technologies Statistical Non-deterministic relationships between variables are captured in the form of mathematical equations and probability distributions Test hypothesis, regression analyses, probability theory sampling, inferencing Artificial Intelligence Domain experts provide knowledge of system behavior, and knowledge engineers develop computational models using an underlying ontology Logic-based expert systems fuzzy logic, Bayesian networks Temporal Linear/nonlinear equations specify behavior of stochastic processes or of dynamic systems as state transitions and observations Autoregression, survival analysis, Kalman filters Hidden Markov Models Dynamic Bayesian Networks Machine Learning System input/output behavior is observed, and M techniques extract system behavior models Clustering, neural network and various linear, nonlinear and symbolic approaches to learning  Machine analytics MA\covers the broad spectrum of applications and provides a direct link to the traditional JDL model. Processes that require machine data analysis include physics-derived sensor \(e.g., video\, human-derived \(e.g text\d machine \(e.g., web file s\. MA is also based on the processes of man-mach ine and machine-machine interactions. Inside MA are the emerging concepts of \(1 descriptive, prescriptive, predictive analytics, and \(2 scientific, information, and visual analytics. These concepts mirror discussions in the current JDL model revisits of information exploitation The business oriented definitions of analytics complement elements of data fusion 200  Enrich principal component and factor analyses with subspace methods \(e.g., latent semantic analyses  200  Descriptive Analytics looks at an organization\222s historical and current performances which can be used to diagnose the situation 200  Predictive Analytics forecasts future trends, behavior and events for decision support such as to suggest courses of action profile and trending 200  Prescriptive Analytics determines alternative courses of actions or decisions options \(using predictive information\iven the historical, current and projec ted situations and a set of objectives, requirements, and constraints  Visual analytics VA\1 seek s scien tifi c inform atio n   and cognitive representations. Visualization supports analytical reasoning, planning, and decision making through effective data representations and transformations over physical- and human-derived data \(sometimes referred to hard and soft data fusion\Finally, user interaction with machines is important for the collection, exploitation, and dissemination of data 200  Scientific visualization deals with data that has a natural geometric structure \(e.g., MRI data, wind flows 133 200  Extend autoregression and survival analysis techniques with Kalman filter and dynamic Bayesi an networks, embed decision trees within influence diagrams; and  


200  Information visualization handles abstract data structures such as trees or graphs 200  Visual analytics is especially concerned with sensemaking and reasoning   If we look at \223analytics\224 \(Table 3\irrors the JDL \(and other proposed models \226 DFRM and DFIG\ in having both the data fusion reasoning e.g., Bayes\nd systems-level management e.g., control\functions. Thus, the MA is like reasoning, while VA is about management  Table 3 Machine Analytics Mapped to Information Fusion Levels  Fusion Machine Conce p t Level 0 Scientific Access to data and pedigree of information and issues of structured/unstructured data Level 1 Information Visual, text Development of graphical methods for data analysis Level 2 Descriptive Uses data mini ng to estimate the current state \(i.e. Machine learning\ferent reasoning of trends for modeling Level 3 Predictive Future options from current estimates Level 4 Prescriptive Sequencing of selected actions Level 5 Visual Sensing Making and Reasoning Level 6 ActivityBased Policy instantiation of desired outcomes as to a focused mission B  Data Fusion Analytics Descriptive and Predictive Analytics together establish current and projected situations of an organization, but do not recommend actions. An obvious next step is Prescriptive Analytics which is a process to determine alternative courses of actions or decision options, given the situation along with a set of objectives, requirements, and constraints. Automation of decision-making of routine tasks is ubiquitous, but subjective processes within organizations are still used for complex decision-making. This current use of subjectivity should not prohibit the fusion and analytics community from pursuing a computational approach to the generation of decision options by accounting for various non-quantifiable subjective factors together with numerical data. The analytics-generated options can then be presented, along with appropriate explanations and backing, to the decision-makers of the organization Systems routinely collect and store large volumes of data on a continuous basis from a variety of disparate and heterogeneous sources. Though such distribution is coherent with recent thrusts towards net-centric warfare, analysts often face a daunting task when searching for specific data or for series of correlated data residing in distributed sources. One solution is to build a large centralized data storage area in advance, such as a cloud infrastructure. However, the proprietary nature of some of the sources requires that they operate autonomously and hence a distributed fusion approach i s vi t a l   There are also other ty pes of analytics: \(1 Web Analytics  internet usage data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage, and business and market research; \(2 Image Analytics real-world videos and images to extract information with machine performance comparable to humans; and \(3 Cross-lingual Text Analytics Analytics with contents in multiple languages that enable a system to discover and maximize the value of information within large quantities of text \(open-source or internal\ The growing trend in analytics serves at DF/DM for both autonomy \(machine\and automation \(machine to user IV  U SER I NVOLVEMENT  The Observe-Orient-Decide-Act \(OODA\ model serves as another common widely used model, and referenced in the information fusion community. As differentiated from the IM Model which deals with the enterprise and distribution of the data, the OODA is focused on a local control loop. Both of these models are useful for information fusion and can be enhanced with InfoEx capabilities such as visual analytics The ODDA model serves as a good basis for an operator; but updates have appeared with multiple OODA loops: TECKOODA [4  C O OD A  44 a n d  Us ve rs us Them   F o r  example in Fig. 5, a real-time operator is reactive; whereas an analyst has more time for data mining and discovery   Figure 5 \226 Multiple OODA Loop Human/Machine Interactions  Using multiple OODA loops [46 47 ere are two typ e s of cases where an operator is ma king real-time decisions and an analyst is making forensics non-real time assessments. The motivation is based on the paradigms of \(A\etting inside the enemy\222s control loop \(L3\, and \(B\eam decision making L5\Obviously, the selection of the competitor, such as in game theory  req u i r es d e t e rm i n i ng a f o cu sed t h reat  L 6  What is extended from the JDL and variations [48 i s  highlighting real-time versus the non-real time data mining and machine analytics for adaptive information exploitation V  A NALYSIS OF I NFORMATON E XPLOITATION  With the JDL and advances in computation, there is a need to focus on the HLIF management functions such as managing the amount of information available. Current developments in enterprise architectures supp ort information management cloud computing, user refinement through queries, and machine analytics. For contextual reasoning much of the ancillary data is available on a distributed enterprise system to provide situational analysis focused on mission needs. One example is that a user would lik e to refine the estimates of many target tracks and uses semantic queries \(ontology\ to access the database through mach ine analytics /data mining A  Context Tracking with Physics & Human-derived data We designate two types of data: video and user text \(e.g documents\he physics-derived video can be processed by a machine; however, the human-derived text can be processed by a machine, but still needs user involvement to understand the meaning of the connected words Information fusion developments include large data \(e.g imagery\exible autonomy \(e.g., from moving airborne platforms over communication systems\nd human 134

For example, when the user designates an area of interest, the machine can then detect and track targets \(L1 fusion\ and access contextual information through data mining \(L2/L3 fusion\o enhance understanding \(e.g., target type identification \(ID\d activity Finally, the results are used to query the sensors to get more information \(L4 fusion\, store the results, present to the user \(L5 fusion\ disseminate back to the cloud for mission awareness \(L6 fusion B  Information Management Contextual Tracking In scenario 1 raw \(images, text\ \(tracks, keywords and fused \(tracks with classification and ID labels\are sent to user stations. For the five cases \(1-5\we model data scaled to the relative volume values. We assume that there five distributed operators are maintaining surveillance. The complexity from Case 1 to Case 5 is akin to tracking a few targets \(8 = 40/5\ to that of trying to maintain tracks over the entire context of a city \(200 tracks = 1000/5\. For users, they need information fusion support to track these many targets   Figure 7 \226 Traditional JDL Data Fusion Assuming raw data messaging, it is intuitive that the filtered information can reduce the volu me by ruling out unnecessary data \(see Fig. 7\. The results indicate that from the traditional JDL methods, there is little to no information management from the user, mission, or machine analytics In the second notional scenario we are interested in seeing the benefits of user involvemen t, machine analytics, and information management to support distributed users. Not all users require the same collection information; however they can query the information they need from the cloud to be presented on their displays. In this case, we use a publish/subscribe \(Pub/Sub architecture to afford the interactions of distributed users Using Pub/Sub information management, it is important to note that over a different set of users desiring situational context, with two data feeds \(video to tracks and text to keywords\ 40 to 200 tracks, there is a break point in operations. For this case, if you try and normalize over the time duration of the scenario the fused information accounts to three pieces of information for each image. For the case of two operators, they can follow more objects by specializing in the data source and area of designated interest to highlight tracks. The interesting part is the difference between 5 to 10 operators in that there is an order of magnitude more information being passed around as many users \(assumed\ are requesting the same information The notional Scenario 2 speaks to team management. With too many operators looking at similar data, there could be overlap in functions. Using contextual information and user-defined operating pictures \(UDOP\ displays, information can deliver machine analytic results to th e appropriate user. Each UDOP provides a tailored situational display and the user can call the raw, filtered, or fused data. For this scenario, we compare the filtered and fused data as the user does not want the raw data    Figure 8 \226 Data Fusion with info exploitation   Fig. 8 demonstrates possible needs to extend the JDL model In this case, using information management sends the correct data to the correct user \(by request\r assessment However, using the combination of information fusion and contextual awareness in a pub sub enterprise, only the fused data is going back and forth \226 saving volumes of data transactions.

VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Since the inception of the JDL model, it has served as a process model to explain information fusion. This paper revisits the JDL based on technology developments in the last decade as discussed in the IS IF community. We highlight three information exploitation technology developments affecting the JDL model that include: \(1\n enterprise architecture that supports info rmation management to store and access data through clou d computing, \(2\achine analytics for data mining, and \(3\an-machine interfaces to support users as active observers of contextual reasoning \(L5  Acknowledgement: We appreciate the reviewers\222 insightful additions R EFERENCES  1 O Kessle r  et. al 223Functional Description of the Data Fusion Process technical report for the Office of Naval Technology Data Fusion Development Strategy,\224 Naval Ai r Development Center, Nov. 1991 2  A.

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
