Boolean association rule based on Apriori algorithm and the data mining algorithm of the multidimensional association rule based on BUC algorithm of MD mode. Afterwards, this paper regards the main relics of Jiangzhai site as the research object, using the very two algorithms to carry out the association mining analysis of the attribute data of Jiangzhai first period cultural relics. At first, it does the attribute association mining on the ancient big, middle and small houses. Then, it does attribute data mining on the pit tomb buried and the urn tomb of the whole site so as to find the connotative relationships among the 
attribution data, and provides a new technique for the analysis research of archaeology site information  1. Introduction  There's plenty of room for improvements in the current field archaeology, and it mainly includes the following aspects 0017 With the rapid development of the economy, substantive relic sites are discovered, and large numbers of field archaeologists are busying taking the salvageable mining precept to them. So the field archaeology is very passive. There is a problem deserving of study, which is how to do the designed 
mining under the direction of experience, and taking it as a part of economic construction  0018 By virtue of a long filed archaeological mining period, mass mining data can not be collected in order in time, but kept in the leader of an archaeology team for a long time, so the mining report can not come into being as soon as possible to the public for relevant researchers. How to help the field archaeologists quickly putting the archaeological data in order, exploring knowledge in the mass archaeological data and applying them to 
direct the archaeological mining is a very urgent problem that needs to be resolved According to the field archaeological data of Jiangzhai settlement of a prehistoric site, this paper studies the data mining with the purpose of resolving these problems stated above, that is, through the attribute data mining, the aim is to find the internal laws of the site and discover the archaeological knowledge to serve the macro planning and the micro speculation in the archaeology The Apriori algorithm of R. Agrawal from IBM one of the association algorithms, has the greatest 
influence in the field of data mining 000\003 The international main researches of association mining have the following aspects. Koperski and Han  have ever advanced the algorithm of mining high spatial association rules in geographical information databases, that is to say, using the mode or relation with a higher frequency in the spatial database, and given a two-step spatial optimization technique. Han Karypis and Kumar  
have presented two Apriori parallel algorithms, including the intelligent data distribution and mixed classification of mining the association rules. Owing to combine the decision support system 000\003\000Z\000L\000W\000K\000\003 GIS data 000\003 in the analysis of soil salinity, Ekund, Kirkby and Salim  have found the association rule that can be applied to environmental planning and secondary soil salinization monitoring Combining the landscape ecology, environment 
models with GIS, Aspinall and Pearson  have researched the environmental conditions of the catchment in American Yellowstone National Park through the integrated geographical assessment, and then discovered the association rule for environment protection. Clementini, Felice and Koperski  have mined the multi-level spatial association rule from the wide-boundary spatial objects

The following are some domestic researches on the association data mining. Cheng Jihua and Shi Pengfei  have gotten the mining algorithm of multilevel association rules, using set operation to compute the high-frequency mode, which improves the mining efficiency. Xu Longfei and Yang Xiaoyun  have analyzed the mining methods, the mining strategies and the rule mining language of the generalized association rule model. Tu Xingyuan 8 has studied the mining of association rules based on the numerical value attribute. Cheng Jihua and so on  have proposed the mining algorithm of association rules based on the concept. A mining algorithm for generalized association rules based on relation operation by Xiao Li  alternating mining association rules on the multiconcept layers. The transition rule mined by Xiao Li etc  describes the stateís transition in light of a definite probability from the current  period of the system to its next, and the state of the next period is depended on the state and transition probability of the prophase. Zhu Ming, Wang Junpu and Cai Qingshen   have advanced a heuristic search algorithm of an optimal characteristic set on the basis of the example characteristic matrix, and compared it with the greedy algorithm  of the characteristic selection. Ding Xiangwu  has increased the temporal information that describes the timeliness of the association rule into the association rule model. Zuo wanli  has studied the technology of type conversion that extractes the association rule from the databases containing category attributes  2. The association rule algorithm  2.1. The mining of single-dimensional Boolean association rules  Apriori algorithm is the most influential algorithm to mine frequent items of Boolean association rule The classical Apriori algorithm divides the design of the association rule mining algorithm into two steps 0017 The first step is to find all the items, whose supports are greater than the minimum, and these composed of K numbers of frequent items are called K-item set 0018 The second is to take advantage of these frequent items  found in the first step to produce anticipant rules. For each frequent item A, if B 002 A, then B and if Confidence \(BÅ \(A-B\ Å the minimum  confidence  minconf\en the association rule B 001 A-B\s formed The second step is relatively simple because there is only one item on the right side of the rule. If a given frequent item is Y=I 1 I 2  000\003\000 000N  k 000 2, I j 001\031 I, then, there are at most K numbers of rules whose items are only contained in the set {I 1 I 2 I k and the rule is shaped as I 1 I 2 I i-1 I i+1 I k 001 I i 1 000 i 000 k. Among these rules, only those whose confidences are greater than the minimum confidence given by users are left The recursive method is used in the Apriori algorithm so as to produce all frequent items, and the pseudocode is as follows Input: D, the minimum support \(minsup Output: Result = all the frequent items and their supports Method L 1 large 1-itemsets for \(k=2;L k 000 1 001.\000 k++\in C k apriori-gen\(L k-1  for all transaction items transactions t 001\031 D do begin C t subset\(C k t for all candidate items candidates c 001\031 C t do c 002 count end L k c 001\031 C k c 002 count 0011 minsup end Result 001 k L k   2.2. The mining of the multi-dimensional association rules  During the time of mining the multi-dimensional database, the association among the multi-dimensional attributes frequently attracts many more attentions. In general, it imports the first-order logical predicate to express the multi-dimensional association rule, among which the predicate denotes the dimension, and one item of predicates represents a certain object and the others represent certain attributes of the dimension The multi-dimensional association rules can be divided into the association rule among different dimensions and the mixed-dimensional association rule, according to the principle that the same dimension whether occurs repeatedly in the same rule., and the former rule doesn't allow the same dimension to occur repeatedly while the latter allows the same dimension to occur on both two sides of the rule at the same time The type of attributes should be considered when multi-dimensional association rules are mined. The database attribute can fall into the classification attribute, also called the nominal attribute, and numerical quantification attribute. The classification attribute has finite different values without order, while there is connotative order among quantification attributes. All of previous classification algorithms can be applied to the classification attribute, but some pretreatments are needed when it comes to the quantification attribute. In light of the methods of dealing with quantification attributes, the association 
386 


rules related to quantification attributes can be divided into statistic association rule, quantification association rule, and association rule based on distances and so on 000\003  2.3. The improved BUC \(Bottom-Up Computation\ algorithm   The structure of multi-dimensional transaction database D is defined as \(ID,A 1 A 2 A n items the sole identifier of every transaction in the database A i is the structural attribute of the database, and the items is the set of all the items connected with the given transaction. The information contained in every transaction T=\(id,a 1 a 2 a n items-t\ falls into two parts: dimension \(a 1 a 2 a n nd item set \(items-t\he mining process contains two parts. In the first, it mines the mode on dimensional information, and then, it searches the frequent item sets in the projected subdatabase and vice versa. The first step is demonstrated by the multi-dimensional database in table 1 First of all, it searches the combination of the frequent multi-dimensional values, and then finds out the corresponding frequent item sets from the database  Given that the threshold value in database D in table 1 is 2. Afterwards, if the combination of attribute values occurs twice or more than twice, it is frequent, and is called the multi-dimensional mode or MD mode During the mining of MD mode, the improved BUC algorithm pioneered by Beyer and Ramakrishnan as can be used to do it. The basal approaches of the BUC algorithm are as follows   Table 1  The multi-dimensional transaction database D  ID A1 A2 A3 items 01 a 1 m x,y,z 02 b 2 n z,w 03 a 2 m x,z,w 04 c 3 p x,w Order the every item in the first dimension \(A 1 n alphabetical order of values. Because the value of attribute A 1 is expressed by christcross-row, the order is alphabetical rather than depending on the digital 0017 The only MD mode in this dimension is \(a because of only the value of ìaî occurs twice. Owing to the other values of ìbî and ìcî occur only once, they donít belong to MD mode. The value \(*\ the other two dimensions means that there is not relations in the first step, and it can be combined by the allowed values without order. Choose those items owning the MD mode in the database, and they are the samples with ID 01 and 03 in this example. As concerning the second dimension A 2 the values are 1 and 2 respectively, and reorder the predigested database. Because there is not a mode appearing twice, there are not MD mode with the values A 1 and A 2 and  the second dimension A 2 can be ignored, which can not predigest the database any more In the next step, all the selective items will be used Order every item in the third dimension \(A 3 n alphabetical order, the sub-group \(a,*,m\ contained in two items and is a MD mode. Because there is no other dimension in this example, the second step can start 0018 Repeating the process of the first step, it searches MD mode from the second dimension not the first. In the following iterative process, it is not necessary to search the first dimension, so it reduces the search process at the very start. In this example, the second iteration begins from the attribute A 2 and the MD mode is \(*,2,*\here is no other MD mode except the dimension A 3 The last iteration in this example begins from dimension A 3 and the corresponding MD mode is \(*,*,m It is obvious that, the improved BUC algorithm defines a set of MD modes and the corresponding database projection. When all of the MD modes are found, it starts to analyze the next step of the multidimensional transaction database, that is, it makes use of the Apriori algorithm and so on to mine the frequent item sets on each MD mode in MD projection. Another method is to mine the frequent item sets, and just after that, it mines the corresponding MD mode  3. The data mining result and analysis for Jiangzhai site in fi rst period culture  Jiangzhai site is located in Lintong District of Shaanxi Province, southwest close to Linhe River south cling to Lishan Mountain, and north near to Weishui River. It is a Neolithic settlement site belonging to the type of Banpo in the culture of Yangshao. The official excavation of Jiangzhai site lasted 8 years from 1972 to 1979, total 11 scientific excavations, and found a large number of important relics, such as houses, cellars, moats, tombs, fences the pottery of stoves and so on    3.1.

Figure 5  Hot spot detection during the area scanning process Images can be analyzed as soon as available in order to con\002rm/discard the detection to properly align the vehicle with the exploration track while the FSP provides room for the turning maneuver and the realignment with the following exploration track During the each exploration track the Red Eye cameras are automatically activated in order to gather images at the required frame rate that will depend on the camera/optics the selected altitude and the desired frame overlapping between consecutive frames Each frame acquisition is indicated on the screen as a green dot Frame acquisition stops once the FSP is surpassed and re-stars as soon as the helicopter gets into the next ISP While the exploration is being completed thermal images are being analyzed in order to determine if they have a signi\002cant thermal signature In that case the corresponding dots may turn into red or yellow depending on the intensity of the thermal signature Additionally the source of the hot spot is identi\002ed inside the image and then geo-referenced according to the information provided by the IMU and GPS at the time of the acquisition The analyzed information is offered to the controller in order to con\002rm if it is a real hot-spot or maybe stray heat re\003ections from some element on the ground rocks human-made devices etc Thermal images can be over imposed on top of high-de\002nition images in order to facilitate the identi\002cation of the hot-spot Explorations are selected at users discretion and can be repeated if necessary and/or interleaved with the con\002rmation phase After an exploration is being completed some detected hotspots may be still undecided The Red Eye system offers support to design a trajectory that over\003ies all undecided hotspots in order to analyze them at a lower altitude and/or during a hovering 003ight Having a closer look on the potential hot-spot should help deciding its relevance Hot-spots are processed sequentially following the sequence suggested by the application Con\002rmation sequences can be repeated after the ground squads have refreshed the area In that way detected hot-spots can be revisited to determine if the extinguishing task have been successful Given the set of con\002rmed hot-spots the controller can assign them to the available ground squads working on the area Ground squads will receive all information available on the hot-spot like its position thermal and visible images and any available detection information Once the squad has identi\002ed the hot spot and worked on it 6 Hot-spot con\002rmation Ground squad task assignment 


they will communicate the controller through the application that the spot has been processed During this process the controller will be able to follow the progression of the teams on its screen 4 S OFTWARE A RCHITECTURE The active elements in the overall Red-Eye architecture have been already described in Section 2 The proposed software architecture will be composed of 002ve main components Each component will work collaboratively to constitute a platform of high added value to the people in charge of surveillance and to help to make their task more accurately Red-Eye Architecture Components The components of the proposed Red-Eye solution are 017 Sensor platforms and embedded control system on-board the helicopter 017 Mobile ground control station 017 Ground squad information terminal 017 Air/ground communication infrastructure Figure 6 depicts the general application scenario in which a Red-Eye helicopter monitors an active 002re being directly linked to the ground control station In parallel to this direct air-ground communication an additional Mobile Ad-hoc Network MANET connects all ground squad terminals in a highly dynamic structure Two different types of nodes can be found personal terminals operated by 002re\002ghters on the move and vehicle mounted terminals that offer improved link strength Complementing this infrastructure both the RedEye helicopter and the ground control station can become members of this MANET network Specially relevant is the role of the aerial vehicle because it may provide communication to separated squad that may be out of range through ground links Sensor platforms and embedded control\227 The helicopter platform and sensor set is selected according to the targeted 223Mediterranean\224 area and cost objectives A medium altitude tactic helicopter is preferred for cost availability Basically two cameras need to be installed on-board a high de\002nition visual camera and a thermal camera con\002gured for temperature ranges according to the precise mission to be implemented Multi-spectrum thermal sensors may also be desirable but its availability cost and possible integration in a tactic helicopter is uncertain In addition to the INS/GPS-navigation subsystem the avionics in the helicopter should include hardware support to execute all services required to properly manage the monitoring mission sensor management data storage communications image processing 003ight-plan management and mission management All those services are internally networked through the MAREA middleware running on top an Ethernet switch or router All data acquired by the sensor package will be internally stored and partially processed in real-time on board the helicopter Selected telemetry and sensor information will be scheduled to be transferred to the ground control for more detailed analysis All data can be later on transferred to the ground when the helicopter gets back on the ground or during 003ying periods in which no other high-priority data is scheduled to be transferred Mobile ground control station\227 The ground teams working on the surveillance area should have equipment available to directly track the helicopter operation in real time Additionally immediate 223\002re\224-related information should be made available to this control station so that 002re operations coordinators can use it regardless of further distribution of the information to other control centers This is the goal of the Mobile ground control station MGCS The objective is to be able to control the system close to the area of actuation relaying on line-of-sight communications due to the cost and complexity of satellite communications Helicopter location and status actual state of the mission operation and the initially obtained surveillance data will be received there although other data sources in addition to the Red-Eye itself may be available The MGCS will offer a basic graphical GIS interface for quasi real-time management of data and for mission re-tasking according to the 002re evolution Hot-spot management as well as 002re-front detection and evolution could be completed here including a true ortonormalization of the overall information Ground squad information terminal\227 A set of PDA clients carried by 002re brigades will be integrated into a wireless network formed by the Red Eye helicopter and the MGCS These PDAs will receive and present information from the MGCS which could include messages pictures videos maps alarms commands They can also transmit data from a set of attached sensors to the MGCS which includes GPS position of the brigade pictures video messages ambient temperature and humidity etc The position of all information terminals is integrated in the mission interfaces offered by the MGCS to the 002re operations coordinator Air/ground communication infrastructure\227 The availability of a reliable communication connection between the Red-Eye helicopter and the MGCS and eventually with the Squad Information Terminals is critical However the existence of a mixture of communication connections should not negatively interfere with the development of the various mission services involved in the application The MAREA middleware will properly manage these connections according to the priority of the information to exchange the available bandwidth and the cost of each connection The wild\002re monitoring system will initially rely on a variety of commercially communication subsystems namely the embedded radio modem and a wi\002/wimax module for high 7 


Figure 6  General view of the participating modules in the SOA-Based Red-Eye architecture bandwidth data transmission A GPRS/UMTS OEM system and a spread spectrum commercial radio modem will be incorporated in the future Eventually a commercial satellite link can be added depending on the budget availability Transmission rules will limit full resolution image exchange to the wi\002/wimax link Telemetry and Red Eye control will have the highest priority among all other information 003ows Mission control will manage the acquired sensor information those tagged as highly relevant will be scheduled for transmission either in full format or in reduced resolution In case the available bandwidth is not suf\002cient even for reduced resolution images images will be analyzed in order to extract meta information like hot-spot location and/or position of 002re fronts Then this meta-information can be exchanged even with the lowest bandwidth data links Figure 7 describes the main services that will compose the Red-Eye service architecture on-board the helicopter As it can be seen services are distributed in two sub-networks one of them dedicated to data acquisition and management while the second one is dedicated to data exploitation and user HMI interfaces The data acquisition subnetwork contains speci\002c services to manage the image acquisition of both the thermal and the high resolution visual camera Both services will provide streams of synchronized images each one tagged with the local clock of the computers managing both IP cameras Image acquisition will be pre-planned when executing area or perimeter scans while individual images are requested when speci\002c hot-spot points are under analysis In parallel to the image acquisition services a navigation service linked to a INS/GPS unit will provide a continuous stream of computed positions and angular information Both camera services will attach this position information in addition to the time stamp so that other services can process and orto-normalize the images for further analysis This navigation stream will also be used by other services within the RedEye architecture to manage for example the vehicle navigation Finally this image stream is directly stored in a data-base service that acts as main data storage but at the same time as processing queue to provide the hot-spot analysis services to exploit the available thermal images as fast as the available on-board computation permits or to transmit information to the ground segment as fast as the availably communication links permit The data exploitation and user HMI interfaces network contains the on-board controller interface that should provide all the HMI capabilities previously described in Section 3 This service will orchestrate the overall system operation by using a set of supporting services 8 Helicopter-segment services 


Figure 7  Overview of the services implementing the aerial segment of the Red-Eye system The Mission Management Service will organize all automated elements within the operation of the Red-Eye system i.e request the computation of the necessary scanning patterns organize the collected information for each area under exploration and for each scan in each area the activation of the sensors at the start and during the scanning etc The Hot-spot Analysis Service will process the thermal images acquired in order to detect heat In a 002st phase a crude selection criteria will be used If traces of heat are detected a move detail analysis will be performed identifying the speci\002c location in the image in which the hot-spot is located and possibly correlating this information with adjacent images Once a particular hot-spot is detected the thermal image and its high-resolution visual counterpart will be ortonormalized and merged All the combination will be properly stored in the supporting storage service associated to all the remaining scanning information Noti\002cations and or alarms will be sent to the services tracking the operation on the ground so that the images can be scheduled to be transmitted A Geo-server Database Service provides terrain reference to properly perform the orto-normalization tasks but also to provide information for the safe navigation of the helicopter over the terrain The objective is to have enough information so that the scanning operations are scheduled at the appropriate/safe separation from the ground The overall information gathered by the aerial segment of the Red-Eye system can be transmitted to the ground control or even to the individual squads operating on the ground This is achieved through the Communication Gateway Service a subsystem capable of selecting which on of the existing communication links is the available at any time taking into account communication shortage due to loss of line-of-sight and routing the information scheduled to be sent to the ground accordingly to its priority Moreover this gateway is capable of connecting itself to the MANET on the ground so that it can participate as an additional MANET node for achieving connectivity between ground squads that will be isolated otherwise thus permitting a sort of over-the-horizon capavility Finally the Pilot Support Interface and the Red-Eye Operator Interface will implement the overall HMI interaction with the Red-Eye pilot and the operator The 002rst will offer references to the pilot so that he can 003y the required tracks and scanning maneuvers while the second will offer the operator the required interfaces to design the required scanning operations and the analysis capabilities required to identify the most critical hot-spots in real-time Figure 8 describes the main services that will compose the Red-Eye service architecture on the ground Again services are distributed in two sub-networks one of them dedicated to communications while the second one is dedicated to data analysis and user HMI interfaces Middleware-based software systems consist of a network of cooperating components in our case the services which implement the business logic of the application and an integrating middleware layer that abstracts the execution environment and implements common functionalities and communication channels In this view the services are semantic units that behave as producers of data and as a consumers of data coming 9 5 U NDERLAYING MAREA M IDDLEWARE Ground-segment services 


017 017 017 017 Service management The container is the responsible of starting and stopping the services it contains It is also on charge of watching their correct operation and notifying the rest of containers about changes in the services behavior Name management The services are addressed by name and the Service Container discovers the real location in the network of the named service This feature abstracts the programmer from knowing where the service resides or how to communicate with it In case of service malfunctioning it is also the container responsibility to notify the other containers in the domain In this way the containers are able to clear and update their caches From the name management point of view the Service Container acts as a proxy cache for the services it contains Network management and abstraction The services do not access the network directly All their communication is carried by the service container This abstracts the network access allowing the middleware to be deployed in different networks Moreover the container hides the bookkeeping related with the management of UDP/TCP ports and multicast groups Resource Management Given that each network distributed node has a unique container and that all the services in that node are layered on top of it the container is the right place to centralize the management of the shared resources of the node memory CPU time input/output devices that are accessed in exclusive mode etc In some cases for example when the node is a low-end microcontroller the service container can act as a minimal operating system From the point of view of a distributed application there are basically three models for information communication Point-to-Point Client-Server and Data Distribution System Our middleware is designed following the Data Distribution 10 Middleware capacities  Overview of the services implementing the ground segment of the Red-Eye system from other services The localization of the other services is not important because the middleware manages their discovery The middleware also handles all the transfer chores message addressing data marshaling and demarshalling so subscriber services can be on different platforms than the publisher service delivery 003ow control retries etc Any service can be a publisher subscriber or both simultaneously This publish-subscribe model virtually eliminates complex network programming for distributed applications In our architecture MAREA the middle w are tak es the form of a component called service container The services are executed and managed by a service container that is unique in each node of the distributed system network The service container can manage several services and provides common functionalities network access local message delivery name resolution and caching etc to the services it contains The service container supports mechanisms that go beyond the basic publish-subscribe model The key bene\002t is that services are entirely decoupled Very little design time has to be spent on how to handle their mutual interactions In particular the services never need information about the other participating services including their existence or locations The container automatically handles all aspects of message delivery without requiring any intervention from the service including determining who should receive the messages where recipients are located and what happens if messages cannot be delivered More concretely the main functionalities that provide the service container are Figure 8 


System communication model because it better adjusts to the application characteristics of an aerospace mission while the other models are too simple for our purposes The Point-to-Point communication model is the simplest model for a distributed application In this model the distributed elements must implement the communications one by one specifying the target of every communication and assuming communication loses or service redundancies inside the object code This model has been extensively used in telephony applications using protocol stacks to reduce error message treatment As the application complexity increases it requires higher and higher bandwidths and more complex developments because the connection pipes increase exponentially In the case of the Client-Server model the distributed application must create differentiated objects for data providers and data consumers The paradigm of Client-Server has been extensively used in the Internet and also in database accessing applications because it adjusts easily to network requirements and it is simple and intuitive to develop applications In fact Client-Server model is the base of network 002le systems database management systems and Internet services e-mail browser etc Most middleware approaches like SUN RPC CORBA or Web Services are also designed under this paradigm The Client-Server model has been extensively used with good results but mainly when information is centralized In this case the server centralizes the accesses to data and minimizes the possible race conditions of data modi\002cations Some of their weaknesses are poor performance possibility of bottlenecks and poor robustness because of the single point of failure The Data Distribution Service model arose as a solution of most novel distributed applications today It promotes a publish/subscribe model for sending and receiving data events and commands among the nodes Nodes that are producing information publish that information and other nodes can subscribe to them The middleware layer takes care of delivering the information to all subscribers that declare an interest in that topic The Data Distribution Services model has been shown as a very good solution for many-to-many communication frameworks They are also very ef\002cient for distributing time-critical information For the speci\002c characteristics of an aerospace mission which may have lots of systems which may interact many-tomany the proposed solution is based in this paradigm Many Data Distribution Services frameworks have been already developed each one contributing with new primitives for such open communication scenario In our proposal we implement only the communication primitives required by a minimalistic distributed embedded system in order to keep it simple and soft real-time compliant The mission and payload control has been used as a motivating example and guiding application Next sections describe the proposed communication primitives which have been classi\002ed in four types Variables Events Remote Invocation and File Transmission Variables As variables we mean the transmission of structured and generally short information from a service to one or more additional services of the distributed system This information is sent at regular intervals or each time a substantial change in its value occurs This relative caducity of the information allows to send it in a best-effort way The system should be able to tolerate the loss of one or more of these data transmissions This communication primitive follows the publicationsubscription paradigm A service can provide zero or more variables Each of them is composed of a basic type boolean integer 003oating point real character string etc or by a composition vector struct or union of basic types From the point of view of the allowed data types in a variable our middleware is similar to a C-like language By means of its service container a service announces the availability of its variables This way other services present in the distributed embedded system can subscribe themselves to one or more of these variables From the moment a service subscribes to a variable the provider service is responsible for sending it with the accorded quality of service characteristics In any case the services using this communication primitive should tolerate the loss of some variable values If this situation goes on the service container will warn of this timeout circumstance to the affected services The provider service can specify the variable validity as a quality of service parameter When a variable value is lost the subscribed services can receive previous values as long as they are still valid In addition the middleware has a mechanism that guarantees an initial exact value for the services that need it The service container maps this sort of communication over UDP packets in broadcast or multicast mode when the underlying network allows it This sort of transmission allows optimizing the bandwidth use because one packet sent can arrive to multiple nodes in the distributed embedded system Events Events are similar to variables in the sense that both work following the publication-subscription paradigm The main difference is that events opposite to variables guarantee the reception of the sent information to all the subscribed services The utility of events is to inform of punctual and important facts to all the services that care about Some examples can be error alarms or warnings indication of arrival at speci\002c points of the mission start of some pre-programmed actions like taking a photo etc Events can contain associated information error codes current position etc or have meaning 11 


by themselves When they carry additional information data is coded the same way as in the variable communication primitive In the case of events an important fact that has to be taken into account apart from correct reception of the message by all subscribers is that latency due to reception and processing may be critical A typical solution to this problem is the reservation of time slots in both the processor and the network The publisher and subscriber services interact with other services always using the service container like in the variable case Finally this communication primitive is mapped by the service container over TCP or over UDP using a mechanism to acknowledge and resend lost packets This speci\002c retransmission mechanism in the application layer is more ef\002cient for event messages than the generic case provided by the TCP stack Remote invocation Most middleware implements some way of distributed computing based on the remote procedure call paradigm for example ONC RPC CORBA or Web Services However for some distributed embedded domains the data publicationsubscription or global data space paradigm seem more appropriate For this reason we provide a 002rst-class set of publishsubscribe communication primitives Nevertheless remote invocation is an intuitive way to model some sort of interactions between services Some examples can be the activation and deactivation of actuators or calling a service for some form of calculation Thus in addition to variables and events the services can expose a set of functions that other services can invoke or call remotely The functions exposed by a service can have an arbitrary number of parameters and optionally a return value This communication primitive implements two-way point-topoint communication between two services one acts as a client and the other as server The client service is always the initiator or the communication and the server service location is abstracted by the middleware However a difference from previous communication primitives is that the client service is not continuously subscribed nor connected to the server service Their relation is occasional and delimited by the time the invocation is executed During middleware initialization the services check that all the functions they need to properly accomplish their task are provided by one or more services available in the network Redundancy and fault-tolerance are managed by the middleware that can also redirect remote calls to server services statically or dynamically Static allocations of the client-server relationships are useful in critical services where resources like CPU time or network bandwidth are pre-allocated On the other hand runtime information can be used to redirect calls to non-critical services to the server where best performance is expected  For this load balancing techniques are used Upon service failure if another service is implementing the same functionality the middleware will detect the situation and redirect requests to the redundant service This allows the system to continue its mission although perhaps in a degraded mode If no service provides the requested function the middleware will warn the system to take the programmed emergency procedure In some cases both event and function primitives can be applied to realize a functionality In this case in our current implementation events seem faster than their function equivalent This communication primitive is generally mapped by the service container over TCP but UDP plus retransmission at the middleware level can be also used However this primitive is never mapped over broadcast or multicast given that is always a point-to-point communication File-based Transmission In our preliminary prototypes it has been discovered that some requirements of the mission are not ful\002lled by the proposed communication primitives In some cases there is the need to transfer with safety continuous media This continuous media includes generated photography images con\002guration 002les or services program code to be uploaded to the service containers Some modi\002cations could be done to the previous primitives to accept this sort of information transfer But 002nally a speci\002c primitive has been developed to treat this case given the huge performance bene\002ts that can be attained This primitive is used basically to transfer long 002le-structured information from a node to another and is implemented mapped directly over TCP Internal Implementation MAREA has been designed with interoperability and 003exibility in mind Their internals have been distributed in several layers allowing the addition of new components such as transports and codi\002cations MAREA has its components distributed in four layers Protocol Encoding Presentation and Transport This distribution loosely resembles the PEPt architecture from The transport layer is the lowest level layer on the MAREA stack It is on charge of sending and receiving data from the underlying network and to interface to the upper Encoding layer The MAREA middleware is message based so the transport layer is especially well suited for datagram based networking i.e UDP In the case of stream based communications the transport layer implementation has two options 12 


Figure 9  MAREA Internal Implementation The 002gure shows the internal delivery of data between components on the same local network a one stream can be opened for each message and after its sending the stream is closed b as the stream initialization usually require a long handshaking phase it is better for performance to reuse the established connections waiting for new messages to be send to the same destination through a unique stream In its current status MAREA offers an UDPTransport TCPTransport and PersistentTCPTransport They implement basic UDP and TCP transports for MAREA messages In the case of PersistentTCPTransport as the 002rst connection with other node is established it is cached in a table indexed by node All the following messages between the nodes that have established the connection are sent through this connection For this transport a speci\002c transport has been designed to dissect the stream into messages Basically each message is preceded by a header that indicates the length of the next message This way the receiving transport layer knows when a message is complete and it can pass it to the upper Encoding layer MAREA transport layer is not limited to IP based communication Although the most common connection between MAREA containers is IP over Ethernet or Wi-Fi other simpler networks are possible for example serial RF modems Each of these connections are represented in MAREA by an ITransport interface This interface provides access to the underlying device and allows to send and receive data and to get link status information i.e link quality expected bandwidth and latency This modular approach allows to easily add new datalinks to the system The encoding layer is on charge of transforming MAREA messages into byte arrays and vice versa Data received in the transport layer is cut into datagrams and sent to the upper encoding layer Here the received bytes are translated into a message that can be processed by the upper layers In a similar way when the Service container needs to communicate with other Service containers it forwards a Message to the encoding layer that transforms it into a coded byte array MAREA provides several coders and decoders to allow easy interoperability and devices/network adaptability Depending on the selected encoding the balance between codi\002cation latency and network bandwidth needed to transmit the encoded message can be modi\002ed Currently MAREA supports one optimized binary encoder and one text-readable XML encoder Finally the Protocol layer is on charge of scheduling the message depending on its priority and after that process it Control messages managing the discovery publication and subscription of services are managed on this layer while data messages are feed to the subscribed services All the services provide a common interface to get noti\002cations and data from the container and other services The service interface contains operations to manage the following operations Start This operation is invoked for all the initial services at container startup A service should respond to this call by allocating its needed resources and start performing its functionality Stop A service is asked to 002nish by receiving this call Container issues this call at system shutdown recon\002guration or during problem containment Run Usually a service requires a thread to perform its job The Run function contains the code to be executed by this main thread VariableChanged When a subscribed Variable primitive gets new data the container calls this function in the subscribed services The function acts as a callback returning the originating service and the sent data EventFired This is the equivalent callback but for Event primitives FunctionCall Finally Function primitives are noti\002ed by issuing this call in the producer service The service executes the indicated operation and returns the results to the container which will send them to the calling service 13 017 017 017 017 017 017 


The service container will issue this operations on the different services as they are initiated stopped or they receive new data from others services In addition the service container will contact with other containers in the local network to discover new services and manage remote publications and subscriptions More details about the protocol between containers are given in the next subsection Figure 9 shows three different views of a MAREA service container receiving and processing a message through its different layers In the leftmost 002gure we can see two service containers deployed over the same aircraft internal network More speci\002cally the Mission Control service noti\002es the Video Camera service to take an aerial photo by using a Variable communication primitive In the central 002gure we focus on what happens inside the service container and its layers First we found the Transport layer where the different transports keep the communication with other service containers Next we found the Encoding layer where the raw data received in a transport is decoded to be scheduled and processed in the upper Protocol layer In the rightmost 002gure the Mission Control noti\002es the Video Camera by using a Variable primitive so the VariableChanged callback is called for all the subscribed services in the container Then each service will react to the input according its functionality 6 G ROUND S EGMENT AND MANET O PERATION Adhoc networks are packet-based multi-node networks that are gaining popularity in other cooperative environments because they do not need a central point of organization like an access point in Wi-Fi networks and they can be selfcon\002gured as nodes appear and disappear If we add dynamism and mobility we reach the concept of MANET Mobile Adhoc Network 13 14 MANETs can extend a network more than the range of a single node range because their inherent multi-hoping capability allows the use of intermediate nodes to propagate packets to its destination Sensi\002re Support Terminal for Ground Squads One of the environments in which the technology has in\003uenced less is the forest 002re\002ghting techniques In this scenario it usually work small groups of 002remen squads organized all around a 002re truck The 002re truck commonly carries a GPS receiver and a radio unit to be in contact with a coordinating base station The Red-Eye system offers the ground squads a PDA system that can receive the set of hot-spots they have been tasked by the controller The PDA set feeds back the position of the squad given its attached GPS The PDA set can also be instrumented in order to feedback other information like temperature humidity level and wind speed and direction These data samples are designed to be sporadic because they need the proper placement of the sensors However the GPS position will be continuously transmitted The main advantage of using a MANET infrastructure is that information can get to the squads either directly from the Red-Eye helicopter of relayed from some other ground squad thus minimizing the 223out of coverage\224 situations Also having a continuous monitoring of the ground squads will improve their ef\002ciency as well as prevent dangerous situations in case of major changes in the evolution of the wild\002re These limited means generates some grave problems dif\002culty for knowing the location and state of the 002re brigades and lack of updated information for the decision taking This situation is make worse by the fact that communication is dif\002cult in these conditions Brigades usually work in zones of dif\002cult access and which lack adequate communication infrastructures They mostly use voice communication over radio and then is dif\002cult to transmit concretely 002re state or positions over the terrain We propose to alleviate these drawbacks by the usage of a distributed system For this application each 002reman will carry a personal digital assistant PDA device communicating with a central base station where all the information is centralized and keep a global vision of the situation The PDA is a small and light device secured to the 002reman arm This way the PDA does not disturb during the 002reman work and he can use the device with his free hand The functionalities provided by the device are receive and present information from the Base Station This include voice messages images picture or videos text messages maps and associated GPS coordinates It can also send these sort of messages Meanwhile the brigade is carrying the PDA its attached sensors are gathering useful information to the base station brigades realtime location temperature and humidity This way the base center can have an updated picture of the 002re and the effectives All the PDAs and the base station conform a mobile ad-hoc network or MANET Obviously this network does not guaranties a perfect coverage however it offers 003exibility and mobility while its coverage can be improved by using repeaters installed in the trucks or in the aerial means The PDA includes a service container and several services that implement the client application Client Application Sensor Module Storage Module and Map Database 017 Sensor module interact with the GPS receiver and the humidity and temperature sensors It can broadcast this data at regular intervals using the variables temperature  humidity and position  In case of an extreme temperature detected it can send an alarm to the base station using the event primitive 017 Storage module is a common component used in most of the applications following this architecture It represents a 14 


002le system where other components can store and retrieve information in a hierarchical way 017 The Map Database is a higher level of abstraction component that allows the storage and retrieval of geo-referenced information mainly maps All 002le-structured information i.e maps or images that is need to be sent to several brigades can be sent using the 002le transfer primitive of the middleware This primitive optimizes the bandwidth usage when multicast networks are used Communication Gateway In air-ground communications it is very common to use different links to support communication at different ranges and to provide redundancy in the case a link is down These pointto-point links usually do not support multicast and may have associated costs economical or power-consumption that restrict their usage to speci\002c situations or very important transmissions In this case the system should be intelligent enough to send the data through the most appropriate channel This decision should be based on the type and length of the data to send the current quality of the different links and the mission status At the same time the communication should be as much uniform and transparent to the services as possible in order to allow the deployment of the same services in different missions over different network relays MAREA has a speci\002c system called Communication Gateway that it is on charge of managing air-to-air and air-to-ground communications Their main purpose is to make the network transparent to the different services that use it Our middleware assumes a highspeed Ethernet-like network that interconnects the different service containers This local area network provides a very good bandwidth/cost ratio and very high reliability Communication Gateway requirements\227 The basic requirements that the Communication Gateway has to ful\002ll are 017 Support for several datalinks The vehicle will have several datalinks that the services should use in command and transparent manner New datalinks should be easily con\002gured to be used 017 Network hardware and protocol independence The services should not be modi\002ed because using one network technology or another The underlying network can use IP or not For example most RF modems provide a wireless RS-232 link this means no data transmission integrity no error correction and no retransmissions MAREA Transport component implementation should resolve this transport-speci\002c problematic while encapsulating and hiding these details to the rest of the system 017 Transparent handover between networks When a communication session has been established between two remote service containers changing from a datalink to other should be transparent to the services involved Imagine that we are using a high-throughput 802.11a WiFi connection to while the helicopter is near the ground station as the distance increases signal will decrease and the Communication Gateway will change to RF modem communication Established sessions will hand over from a datalink to the other 017 Prioritize traf\002c from different services When the available bandwidth is not enough for all the required data 003ows the Communication Gateway should prioritize the traf\002c from speci\002c services Other traf\002c can be discarded postponed its transmission or stored in persistent medium for later processing on ground For example command data should be prioritized always over telemetry data 017 Using simultaneously several networks for higher throughputs If a vehicle con\002guration provides several datalinks and in a speci\002c point of the mission there is a high throughput necessity and they are available the MAREA container should distribute the generated data through the different datalinks Imagine that we have two RF modem on different bands and we want to download to ground a high-resolution aerial photo by using the two RF modems simultaneously we will be able to 002nish the job in half the time 017 Security and encryption The MAREA protocol has some security checks but in general it has not need to cope with malicious services because the internal local network can be considered safe When the communications are done external to this network and using a wireless channel the possibilities that this channel can be attacked are highly increased Some effort is done in this area although the current implementation of the current gateway lacks these features System architecture\227 The idea of the communication gateway is to add a new layer on the stack that will manage the multiple datalinks and decide which to use for each data 003ow This process is dynamic as it depends on the links status Link status can change from available to unavailable in any moment of the mission on that case the Communication Gateway will be on charge to transparently handover the communications from one link to other One advantage of separating this functionality on an independent layer is that the service containers present on internal networks not needing handover and multiple network interface functionalities can remove completely this layer avoiding all the resources cost Communication Gateway layer is installed between the Protocol and Encoding layers just before deciding which encoding use It only processes output messages Input messages are bypassed and their differentiation is performed at the scheduling done by the Protocol layer Messages from high priority services are queued before An XML con\002guration 002le de\002nes which transports to use and which policies to apply to each sort of packets The packets are mainly classi\002ed by their producer and their consumer In addition to this static information the Communication Gateway receives dynamic information from the Transport layer mainly the link status of all the transports enabled The Transport components on the transport layer has been extended to be able to

All information related to link status and interfaces are stored in a component called Network Manager The Network Manager it is on charge on relating addresses with its link status With this both dynamic and static information the Selector component decides to which interface send each Message Services and service container layers use speci\002c objects called TransportAddress to identify the recipient of a Message This object not only carries the address of the underlying speci\002c networks for example its IP address but also information about the encoding to use This TransportAddress will be used by the lower layers to select the appropriate encoding and interface Communication Gateway only needs to route the Message through the lower layers by changing the TransportAddress of the Message Figure 10  Communication Gateway architecture The 002gure shows the layers of the MAREA middleware interacting with Communication Gateway A general view of the architecture is shown in Figure 10 After being processed by the Protocol layer two packets arrive at the Communication Gateway With the information gathered from the Transport layer and stored in the Network Manager about the two Link available the Selector decides which route to use The XML con\002guration 002les de\002nes that the Messages from Service 1 are encoded in binary and sent through network 1 Wi-Fi while the Messages from Service 2 are encoded also in binary but sent through network 2 RF In addition to the Communication Gateway layer a speci\002c SerialTransport has been implemented to be able to use Radio Frequency Modems based on RS-232 interaces for example the Digi 2.4Ghz XStream module 7 C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK Having aerial resources working in a command and control over wild\002res may improve the overall extinguishing process Improving the awareness trough those monitoring systems may will maximize the ef\002ciency of the available resources and at the same time improve the safety of the personnel working on the 002re However the complexity of integrating these monitoring systems together with the traditional aerial resources is a complex and unsolved task The Red-Eye system is a partial solution to this task Its objective is to provide hot-spot detection over areas in which other aerial resources has been temporally removed It has been identi\002ed that this scenario may provide important bene\002ts in terms of ef\002ciency Red-Eye will allow aerial and ground resources to be employed on other 002re fronts by reducing the number of resources that need to be kept on the 002eld one a 002re front has been controlled Red-Eye works on top of a middleware speci\002cally designed for avionics MAREA provides a full distributed paradigm to the avionics designers Each avionics semantic is encapsulated into a service or piece of software which realizes a function Data communication between services are always conducted through the middleware The physical location of the services is transparent to the designers being MAREA responsible of the service discovery location and execution The main targets in the MAREA development process have been the communications ef\002ciency the transparent service location and the automatic selection of the physical link for the communications The communications ef\002ciency is de\002ned as the relation between the transfer speed and system cost The paper presents also the second layer the gateway This layer has information from the lowest layer about all the available links and their status The gateway using a con\002guration 002le decides the best physical channel Service ubiquity is the 002nal result for avionics designers A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work has been partially funded by Ministry of Science and Education of Spain under contract CICYT TIN 200763927 This work has been co-\002nanced by the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation EUROCONTROL under its CARE INO III programme The content of the work does not necessarily re\003ect the of\002cial position of EUROCONTROL on the matter R EFERENCES  223Upnp forum 224 http://www upnp.or g Online A v ailable http://www.upnp.org  Y  Kaufman C Justice L Flynn J K endall E Prins L Giglio D Ward W Menzel and A Setzer 223Potential global 002re monitoring from eos-modis,\224 Journal of Geophysical Research  vol 103 no 32 pp 215\226238 1992  L Giglio J Descloitres C Justice and Y  Kaufman 16

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
