Linguistic Summarization of Data Association Rules Sets Using Janusz Kacprzyk Member IEEE and Slawomir Zadrokny Abstract-We discuss linguistic summaries of databases introduced by Yager 28,29 Starting with our previous work 7,8,9,13,14-161 we propose some extensions to the form of a liiguistic sannnary The new form still fits the scheme of an assochlion rule 1,24,25 However in comparison to the previous approaches, the use of a range of linguistic values as items and their linguistically 
quantified aggregation is allowed An algorithm for mining such association rules within this framework via the authors FQUERY for Access package is presented Moreover we show that Zadeh's 311 idea of protofom and their hierarchies can be employed to represent various types of linguistic summaries Index Terms-Data mining linguistic database summary association rule fuzzy querying protoform 1 INTROOUCTION Collections of data gathered either in regular databases or data warehouses are now too voluminous to be comprehensible and manageable by humans and intelligent techniques for their 
handling are needed The approach we advocate here refers to linguistic summaries of data introduced by Yager 281 exemplified by Most expensive real-estate properties possess large land area Thus linguistic summaries provide us with the highly aggregated information on the data in question The use of linguistic terms makes the summaries more human Consistent The point of departure is our add-in to Microsoft Access DBMS FQUERY for Access, which makes possible the use of flexible fuzzy queries Kacprzyk and Zadroiny 11-12 The use of linguistic terms in queries provides for some 
form of information aggregation Our fuzzy querying interface inherently supports some features required for an efficient implementation of linguistic summaries due to Yager 28,29 In Kacprzyk and Zadroiny 7,8,9.13,14-16 we described a preliminary implementation of linguistic summaries within our FQUERY for Access So far, only a limited subset of possible types of summaries was implemented The most sophisticated form of the summary is computationally very difficult We proposed to employ well-known efficient association rules mining algorithms for that purpose It makes it possible to mine more sophisticated although still rather simplified, forms of linguistic summaries Here 
we investigate the possibility of further advancing in this direction  Moreover we show that Zadehs 31 recent idea of a hierarchy of protofom of linguistic summaries may provide a convenient theoretical framework The association rules were originally meant for binary data mining and efficient algorithms have been devised to generate them Moreover the concept is easily extensible to more complex data including real valued and scalar data as well as taxonomies of values Our approach consists in adapting rules discovery algorithm for the use of linguistic terms so that either fuzzy querying or data mining can be 
set up on the same vocabulary of linguistic terms Here we proceed further employing the same algorithm for mining summaries of an enriched structure We outline the idea of linguistic summaries their classification and relation to Zadehs 31 concept of a hierarchy of protoforms We discussed proposed here extended forms of summaries and how they can be generated using association rules mining algorithm 11 DATA MINING VIA LINGUISTIC DATABASE SUMMARIES Data mining is meant for finding interesting pattems dependencies regularities etc in data stored in databases Yager 28,29 proposed to use linguistically quantified 
propositions due to Zadeh 301 to summarize the content of a database table For example it may be interesting for a manager to get the following summary of the table EMPLOYEES holding information on the staff of his company Most of the employees are of medium age and eam a high salary or Most of the newly hired employees with a high salary are young Such linguistically expressed statements may be of a great value but we have some means to assess their validity mth Zadehs 30 
calculus of linguistically quantified propositions makes it possible to calculate the truth-value of such propositions which may be put in a more general form 1 Most elements of set X satisfy s and formally expressed as follows Q S\(x EX The authors are with the Systems Research hstifute Polish Academy of Sciences 01447 Warsaw I Newelska 6 Poland e-mails kacp~yk@ihspan.waw.pI mdromy@ibrpan.waw.pl 0-7803-7810-5/03/$17.00 82003 IEEE 702 The IEEE International Conference on Fuuy Systems 


where Q is a fuzzy linguistic quantifier e.g most x Y  x is a universe of discourse and a fuzzy predicate The second example exemplifies another form of a proposition Most elentents of set X satisfying F satisfy also property s 3 that may bc formally expressed as follows QFS\(.r 4 A\200 x where F is another fuzzy predicate Both F and S are fuzzy equated with fuzzy sets Fand S so that truth\(S\(.v us\(.ri and truth\(F\(.r u,c\(.r In fact wherever a predicate is mentioned there may appear just a predicate an atomic formula s is newly hired or a combination of predicates a formula Ir is newly hired and r has got a high salary In the context of database table the set X is identified with the set of rows of this table and the formula S inay be uiiderstood as a query Then I states that niost of tlie rows satisfy the query formula S The more complex is the query involved the less trivial is the suminary obtained 111 large data sets it may relatively seldom happen that most rows satisfy a given noli-trivial query Then a proposition of type 3 may be helpful Namely it states that a subset of rows satisfies specified query In the database terminology formula F may be understood as apIter and 3 asserts that iiiosr of the rows passing through F match query S Moreover since F may be fuzzy a row may pass through it to a degree from 0,1 In Yager's approach 128 291 the truth-value of\(I or 3 is the primary measure of quality of the obtained summary Practically such a basic quality indicator has to be supplemented with some measure of interestingness non triviality unexpectedness   cf Kacprzyk and Yager 91 or Kacprryk Yager and Zadroiny IO In what follows we will discuss different types of linguistic data summaries based on the gcneral scheme given by 3 Thus the generation of a linguistic summary consists in finding propositions of type 3 that have a high truth-value Basically a proposition sought consists of three elements a fuzzy filter F optional a query S and a linguistic quantifier Q There are two limit cases where we 1 do not assume anything about the form of any of these elements or 2 fix all the elements of a summary In case 1 data summarization will be extremely time-consuming but may produce interesting results In case 2 the user has to guess a good candidate for summarization but the evaluation is fairly simple, equivalent to the answering of a fuzzy query In-between there are different types of summaries with various assumptions on what is given and what is sought It may be noticed the concept of a protoform in the sense of Zadeh 31 may be valuable for tlie study of all possible types of summaries First of all a protoform is defined as an abstracted prototype that is in our context is given by 2 and 4 Protoforms may form a hierarchy i.e we can define higher or lower level more or less abstract protoforins e.g replacing Q with IJIOSI in 2 and 4 we obtain I and 3 respectively Therefore the more abstract forms correspond to cases in which we assume less on what we know In our previous work lO,l5 we proposed 5 types of summaries corresponding to different levels of abstraction in the hierarchy of the protoforms Here we are interested in a simplified version of the summaries of type 5 that correspond to the most abstract protoform 4 It is worth noticing that it may be interpreted as a classical IF-THEN rule stating that in case of niost rows if they satisfy filter F then they satisfy also query S For a general form of such a rule it is difficult to devise an effective and efficient generation algorithm Generic al&orithm based approaches may be employed 61 In order to alleviate the computational complexity, additional assumptions may also be made For example some sets of relevant interesting promising etc attributes for the query and the filter may be selected in advance Some constraints may also be put on the structure of S and F In the next section we pursue this idea and discuss in more detail a special case of this type of summaries that correspond to the well-known concept of the association rule Then computationally efficient algorithms known in the literature may be employed for mining the summaries 111 ASSOCIATION RULES AN0 LINGUISTIC SlIhlMAKIES Originally the association rules were defined for transactional data and binary valued attributes in the following form AId2~...d A 5  An association rule states that if in a datahase row a11 the attributes from Al A2 A take on value 1 then also attribute A is expected to take on value 1 A row in a database table is said to srippoi-t a set of attributes AiltE if all attributes from the set take on in this row value 1 There are WO measures of the quality of an a~~ocintion rule 5 1 the sirpporl is the fraction of the number of rows supporting the set of attributes A iE  I,..,n+l  in a database table and 2 the coiifideiice is the fraction of the rows supporting A ic I  i1+1 among all rows supporting A ie  I,..,ii Thus while the support determines a statistical significance of a rule the confidence measures its strength. Usually we are interested in rules having values of the support above some minimal threshold and a high value of the confidence This form of association rules was motivated by their early applications for a so-called customer's basket analysis Some efficient algorithms for finding all association rules possessing a required support measure were devised see e.g 1,20 and association rules have become a very popular tool for data mining The original concept of an association rule evolved over time but still the same algorithms are applicable The 703 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 


extensions to the initial form of the association rule include the following I the right-hand side like the left-hand side may contain a conjunction of the attributes instead of just one attribute 2 many-valued scalar values and their hierarchies may be used 1241 3 numerical real-valued attributes may be used 25 leading to the quantitative association rules and iv 4 some constraints may be imposed on combinations of attributes in rules 26 In view of i and iii the initial scheme of an association AI=alA2-~A...AA.=a 3 A.+I=a,+lA...AA.+,=a 6 where ai represents a value or a range of values of an attribute Clearly association rules may be interpreted as a special case of summaries Namely, the antecedent and consequent of 6 correspond to filter F and query S of 41 respectively Confidence of a rule is related to the combination of the linguistic quantifier and truth degree of 4 General concept of the linguistic summary assumes a query S to be a formula atomic or complex Thus the structure of the filter and the query available in case of association rules is rather limited but this simplicity secures the existence of efficient algorithms for rule generation In our previous work we implemented mining of the linguistic summaries corresponding to the association rule 6 within the framework of our fuzzy querying package cf the next section For that purpose we generalized 6 to the following form 7 This boils down to the use of fuzzy valuesf instead of crisp values or their ranges as in 6 Here we propose two extensions to this form offurzy association rule First a minor one enriches the structure of an atomic condition 1 ii 111  rule 5 may be rewritten as follows Ai AI Isf1~...41Sf 3 A ISfn+~~...4+,,,ISfn Ai lSf 8 an item in the terminology of the association rules by allowing it to take the following form Ai IS It;lv...vJk 9 where Ji are all fuzzy values defined over the domain of the attribute A Thus we propose to make it possible to use a range of fuzzy values what corresponds to the case of quantitative crisp association rule 25 In practical cases it is often enough to consider just three fuzzy values for a numerical attribute low medium high Then the atomic condition 9 may be identified with a negation as in the following example salary IS low or medium I salary IS NOT high The second extension of 9 consists in using a flexible aggregation operator in query andlor filter formula This leads to the following form of the atomic condition where Q is a linguistic quantifier e.g most In practical cases this will be most often the only atomic formula in an antecedent or consequent of an association rule However it may be just a part of a compound formula Please observe, that fi in 9 refer to the same attribute while fls in 10 to different attributes The idea of such an extension of the fuzzy association rules is rooted in the capabilities of our fuzzy querying package FQUERY for Access The next section presents it briefly providing also some details of the implementation of the above extensions to the fuzzy association rules syntax IV ASSOCIATION RULE MINING VIA FQLiERY FOR ACCESS Fuzzy querying consists in a direct use of linguistic terms in queries Our implementation FQUERY for Access package supports the following types of linguistic terms 1 numericalfuq values exemplified by low in salary is 2 scalar furzy values exemplified by Central Europe in 3 fuzzy relations exemplified by much greater than in 4 linguistic quantifiers exemplified by most in most In our description of fuzzy linguistic summaries we will be concerned only with type I and 4 linguistic terms Fuzzy linguistic quantifiers are handled using Zadehs 30 calculus of linguistically quantified propositions cf 1 4 Usually a query consists of a number of simple conditions combined using the classical AND and OR In our approach linguistic quantifiers provide for a more flexible aggregation of simple conditions in queries For example instead of requiring that all simple conditions be met using a linguistic quantifier we may indicate that most of them are to be met The definitions of all linguistic terms including representing them fuzzy sets are maintained in dictionaries of linguistic terms defined by users as well as predefined in the system Thus in fact all building blocks of the fuzzy linguistic summaries as defined with 7 are available within our fuzzy querying environment Moreover it may be assumed that the linguistic terms defined by a user have a clear interpretation for him or her Thus a fuzzy querying interface offers a practical solution to some problems the classical l 25 261 search for the association rules faces Namely, the quantitative association rules i.e including also non-binary attributes usually require discretization of the attributes obtained via a panition of its domain into a number of intervals Then, each interval is treated as an additional binary attribute and known algorithms for the generation of classical association rules may be employed It is not obvious how such a partition should be arrived at Having a domain covered by a number of overlapping fuzzy values defined and tested for the purposes of fuzzy querying\makes the partition available for free Combining querying and mining within the same interface seems to yield a synergetic effect Also from the viewpoint of low country is in Central Europe income is much greater than spending", and conditions have to be met 704 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 


software engineering it is advantageous as we can employ some of the modules to support both functions Thus we extended our package with the capability of producing linguistic summaries of a database Here we consider only those corresponding to fuzzy association rules notably as illustrated with 9 and IO The user interface is the same as for fuzzy querying However for computational efficiency reasons, the very algorithm of fuzzy association rules mining is implemented as a separate executable implemented using Delphi Our implementation of association rules is based on the Agrawal and Srikant\222s AprioriTID algorithm I Basically, the algorithm works in two steps first it finds frequent itemsets and then produces rules from each itemset The second step is relatively easy hence we will focus on the first one An itemset is a conjunction of the items of the form 9 or IO A row in the database table is said to support an itemset if the corresponding conjunction 223is true\224 for this row An itemset containing k items is called a k-itemset The algorithm starts with the evaluation of 1-itemsets These itemsets which are not supported by sufficient number minsup of rows are deleted Previously we assumed 1-itemsets only in the form 8 In order to implement items of the form 9 and IO we have to extend this step Namely we treat as I-itemsets also items of the formAi IS J1v...vJJ and Q of\(Al ISf Az Ish A IS f\223 More precisely first only 223regular\224 I-itemsets 8 are counted i.e a full scan of the database table is done and frequency of appearance of all items is calculated Then 1 itemsets 9 are constructed however only such f are taken into account that have support greater than some value another parameter of the method besides minsup and minconf higher than 0 and less than minsup For example, if a regular l-itemset 223salary IS high\224 gets very low support we will not construct neither 223salary IS medium or high\224 nor 221\221salary IS low or high\224 1-itemsets This helps to reduce the time and memory complexity of the algorithm Such reduction is even more important in case of the implementation of 10 1-itemsets Basically we should take into account all subsets of regular 1-itemsets and all possible quantifiers Q This would he computationally intractable and in fact require a kind of recursive use of Apriori in the first step Thus in the current implementation we limit ourselves to just one fixed quantifier by default it is a counterpart of the 223more than 50%\224 phrase Moreover for obvious reasons, we take into account only such subsets of regular items that all refer to different attributes and there is enough number of them to make quantification Thus, we will e.g neither construct a 1-itemset of the form 223most salary IS high salary IS low r nor 223most salary IS high age IS high Having the 1-itemsets of the form 9 constructed we calculate their support We assume that informally speaking no row supports two different fuzzy values for the same attribute Then, the support for Ai IS t;lv...v is just the sum of supports for Ai IS Ai I  k that we calculated earlier Now I-itemsets of the form 10 are constructed They may use both regular l-itemsets as well as 9 1-itemsets e.g meaningful 223Most AI IS filv...vfiJ A2 Ish  are allowed Now the support for 10 I-itemsets is calculated However due to the use of AprioriTID version of the algorithm another full scan of the database is not needed During the first scan we have recorded in some data structures the IDS of rows supporting particular regular l-itemsets and now it is enough to operate on this structures Obviously it does increase memory complexity of the algorithm Then the algorithm proceeds as usual I generating and evaluating k-itemsets for k=2,3   The only additional effort is needed to guarantee that no itemset produced twice refers to the same attribute e.g a 2-itemset 223salary IS high AND salary IS medium\222\222 have to be excluded Finally all found frequent itemsets are taken into account when producing association rules of the confidence at least equal to the required value minconf We deal with real valued attributes Thus following previously mentioned approaches for each such an attribute and each defined for it fuzzy value we introduce a new items which may be treated as binary i.e appearing in a row or not Thus practically only a limited number of fuzzy values per attribute say 3 leads to computationally tractable mining tasks For example, taking into account the attribute SALARY may yield the following items: SALARY IS SALARY IS medium and SALARY IS high A row supports such an item e.g SALARY IS low if the value of the attribute SALARY in this row best matches the fuzzy value 221low\222 or in other words this value\222s membership degree is highest for a fuzzy set representing 223low\224 in comparison to fuzzy sets representing 223medium\224 and 223high\224 In our current approach we use crisp support, i.e., we select \(exactly one best matching fuzzy value we possibly use random tie breaking mechanism and say it is fully supported by given row Another option is to allow 223support to a degree\224 from 0 11 The implementation of the linguistic summaries mining via extended fuzzy association rules may be summed up as follows Selection of the attributes and fuzzy values Normally, the use of all attributes for rules construction is not recommended Thus the user has to choose the attributes to be used Moreover they should he accompanied with some meaningful description to be used in the rule presentation In the current implementation the user simply builds a query referring to all attributes which should be taken into account The same applies to the selection of fuzzy values Then. the user initiates the data summarization sets the parameters minsup, minconf and other discussed above and the system automatically performs the rest of steps Construction of the items For each pair  of selected attributes and fuzzy values  the system creates an item as described earlier p Creation of the data set and starting external application for fuzzy linguistic rules mining The items constructed in the previous step are numbered Then the data set is produced describing each 705 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 


row with numbers of items supported by it As discussed earlier an attribute value in a row may supports exactly one item The calculations are supported by fuzzy querying module. When the data set is ready an extemal application is started with this data set given on input J Calculation of the support for the regular 1 itemsets Extemal application reads input data set and immediately calculates support for the regular 1-itemsets It also records for each I-itemset numbers Ds of rows supporting it Construction of 1-itemsets of type 9 and calculation of their support Only regular 1-itemsets of the support higher than a user-specified threshold are taken into account Number of produced I-itemsets of this type for given attribute depends on the number of fuzzy values defined for it The support is obtained by summing up the support of constituent reular I-itemsets All new 1-itemsets are numbered according to a specific convention Pruning of the set of 1-itemsets All itemsets with the support lower than the support threshold minsup are discarded Additionally also itemsets with the support higher than another threshold an item omit threshold are discarded since items present in almost all records contribute nothing interesting to the produced rules Construction of 1-itemsets of type lo calculation of their support and pruning Both regular and l-itemsets added in the Step 5 are considered we refer to them jointly as simple 1-itemsets Produced I-itemsets are identified with lists of constituent simple 1-itemsets The lists are ordered lexicographically what makes the process of generation more efficient Support is computed for generated itemsets and those below minsup threshold are dropped All itemsets produced so far and passing pruning form now the collection of l-itemsets SETk=2 Generate k-itemsets They are generated from frequent k-1 as in AprioriTid. Pairs of frequent k-1 itemsets of the form AI/\\AAZ~.../\\A and BlhB>~...hBk where A for i=l,..,k-2 are sought Then the new k-itemset of the form AI/\\AZ~.../\\A~.I~~.l is generated In the original algorithm the rules so generated are additionally tested and possibly eliminated before Step 7 On the other hand we add another k-itemset generation limitation namely items Abl and have to correspond to different original attributes. This requirement is obvious if items Atl and Bk are regular. Otherwise, identifying an item 9 or IO with a list set of attributes referred to within it we require that the intersection of these sets is empty Calculate support for all k-itemsets The calculation is based on the recorded numbers ID\222S of rows supporting particular k-1 The similar data on the supporting rows is produced for k-itemsets Pruning of the set of k-itemsets as in Step 6 As the result we obtain the frequent k-itemsets IF the set of k-itemsets is void THEN GOT0 Step 11 SET k k 1 GOTO Step 8 Generate rules from frequent I-itemsets l=l,..,k-1 and output them to the file An external application completes its work 2 Display the results The module of FQUERY for Access regains control reads the results of the external application, decodes numbers of the items comprising produced rules and displays results in a form readable for the user The number of produced rules is usually huge Some counter-measures have to be undertaken as e.g., approaches to concise association rules representation see e.g IS We adopted the following pruning scheme A rule R1 is pruned if there exists another rule R2 such that the three conditions are met simultaneously 1 the antecedent of R2 is a subset of the antecedent of R1 2 the consequent of R1 is a subset of the consequent R2 3 the confidence of R2 is not less than the confidence of R1 This leads to a substantial lossless reduction of the number of rules V CONCLUDING REMARKS We presented the use of fuzzy linguistic summaries as a natural and human consistent tool for data mining We indicated that Zadehs 31 concept of a protoform and a hierarchy of protoforms may conveniently be used to present various linguistic summaries We extended our previous work on the application of association rules mining technique for generation of linguistic summaries We proposed more sophisticated forms of fuzzy association rules Their mining becomes even more complex These applies especially to the concept of linguistically aggregated elementary items 10 Similar concept has been recently proposed by other authors 27 Their AND-OR taxonomies share some expressive power as well as computational complexity with our proposal The latter is addressed in 27 with a strong restrictions on the allowed combinations of items in itemsets. Both approaches are also in some sense 223opposite\224 in 27 a sophisticated taxonomy is assumed as in other classical approaches to linguistic association rules mining cf  while in our it may be to some, limited extent, recovered We show that data mining tools dealt with in the paper based on linguistic summaries can be implemented through 706 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
