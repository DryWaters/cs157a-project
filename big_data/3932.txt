Application Research of Cluster Analysis and Association Analysis Hai-Dong Meng, Yu-Chen Song, Fei-Yan Song, Hai-Tao Shen School of Mining Engineering Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology Baotou, China haidongm@imust.edu.cn   Abstract For applications of data mining techniques in geosciences, through mining spatial databases which are constructed with geophysical and geochemical data measured in fields, the knowledge such as the spatial distribution of geological targets, the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of geological targets, the differentiation among the geological targets, and the relationship among geophysical and geochemical data, can be discovered Due to the complexity of geophysical and geochemic al data, traditional mining methods of cluster analysis and association analysis have limitations in processing complex data. In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on density and adaptive density-reachable is presented which has the ability to handle clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. For association analysis, mining the continuous attributes may reveal useful and in teresting insights about the data objects in geoscientif ic applications. Quantitative association rules aims to deal with the relationships among continuous attributes of geoscientific data objects. An association analysis algorithm based on the distances among clusters projected on attributes is presented in this paper. Experiments and applications indicate that the algorithms are effective in real world applications Keywords- Cluster analysis; Association analysis; Geo-spatial database; Geochemical data; Data processing I  I NTRODUCTION  Cluster analysis has long played an important role in a wide variety of fields: psy chology and other soci al sciences, biology pattern recognition, machine learning, image processing information retrieval, geosciences, and climate research Cluster analysis aims to identify groups of objects \(clusters that satisfy some specific criteria, or share some common characteristics. A large number of clustering algorithms have been developed in a variety of dom ains for different types of applications. None of these algor ithms is suitable for all types of data, clusters, and appli cations. In fact, it seems that there are always rooms for new clustering algorithms that are more efficient or better suited to partic ular types of data clusters, or applications [1 In many application domains, such as geoscientific data processing, clusters of data objects are of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities, and the number of clusters is unknown. In such scenarios, traditional clustering algorithms, including partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods and grid-based methods cannot identify clusters efficiently or accurately. Obviously, these are critical limitations or weaknesses of clustering methods. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems. For example, Ertˆz, Steinbach, and Kumar proposed a clustering technique that addresses the problem of finding clusters in data when clusters are of widely differing sizes, densities and shapes, and when the data contains large amounts of noise and   presented a multiple data clusterings combiner, based on a proposed Weighted Shared nearest neighbors Graph \(WSnn G\he problem addressed in the paper is that of generating a re liable clustering to represent the natural cluster structure in a set of patterns, when a number of different clusterings of the dat a is available or can be generated. A clustering method called CLARANS which aims to identify spatial struct ures that may be present in the data was propose DBSCAN [5, 6 is a sim p l e and effective density-based clustering algorith m which is relatively resistant to noise and can handle clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes but it has trouble when the clusters have widely varying densities. Zhang, Ramakrishnan  efficient data clustering meth od for very large databases, which is based on the notion of clust ering feature and effective for incremental clustering. A cluster ing algorithm based on density and ada aims to handle complex data Much work in data mining revol ves around the discovery of rules within large quantities of data. The rules over relations are of the form X Y where X and Y are conditions on tuples of the relation. The term association rule has been used to describe a specific form of such rules Association rule analysis aims to find frequent patterns in datasets. Frequent patterns are patterns \(such as itemsets subsequences, or substructures frequently. Finding such freq uent patterns plays an essential role in mining associations correlations, and many other interesting relationships among data objects. Frequent pattern mining has become an important data mining task and a focused theme in data mining research. Association rule analysis is applicable to many application domains such as bioinformatics, medi cal diagnosis, Web mi ning, and scientific data analysis [1 Algorithms for discovering cl assical association rules make different assumptions about the ty pe of datasets to be mined. In general, the dataset is a relat ional table. The domains of the 59 7 


attributes are restricted to boolean domains. The databases in most business and scientific domains have many types of attributes, including quantitative, categorical or boolean attributes. The classical association analysis algorithms for boolean attributes can not mine quantitative association rules from databases with continuous attributes, and may yield very unintuitive results when applied to continuous attributes. R Srikant and R. Agra p roposed an algorithm for mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables, defined the problem of mining associati on rules over quantitative and categorical attributes in large relational tables, presented techniques for discovering qu antitative rules, and referred to this mining problem as th e quantitative association rules problem. For the problem of mining association rules over interval data, R. J. Miller and Y. Yang pr oposed the definition of interest for asso ciation rules that takes into account the semantics of interval data and developed an algorithm for mining association rules under the definition. A definition of quantitative asso ciation rules based on statistical inference theory was presented by Y. Aumann and Y. Lindell  intui tion that the goal of association rules is to find extraordin ary and therefore interesting phenomena in databases. The definition is not based on a discretization paradigm that çconvertsé quantitative data into categorical items, but based on the consideration of the distribution of the continuous data, via standard statistical measures such as mean and variance In this paper, on the basis of cluster analysis and the definition proposed by R. J Miller and Y. Yang algorithm for mining distance-b ased quantitative rules is presented, which is a new appr oach to handling continuous attributes for association analysis. The purpose is to improve the validity and efficiency of association analysis for handling continuous attributes, and to ma ke it more suitable for real world applications The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present a novel clustering algorithm based on density and adaptive density-reachable in section 2. In section 3, the creation of quantitative association rules based on distance is proposed The experiments and applications of the algorithm are presented in section 4. Section 5 concludes with a summary and some directions for future research II C LUSTERING A LGORITHM BASED ON D ENSITY AND ADAPTIVE D ENSITY REACHABLE  Clustering aims to find usef ul groups of obj ects \(clusters There are many concepts about clusters. Based on the spatial distribution of data objects, th e type of clusters can be described as follows [1 Well-separated cluster. A cluster is a set of objects in which each object is closer \(or more similar\very other object in the cluster than to any object not in the cluster Center-based clusters. Each object in a cluster is closer to center of the cluster than to centers of any other clusters Contiguity-based clusters. Each object in a contiguity-based cluster is closer to some other ob ject in the cluster than to any point in a different cluster Density-based clusters. A cluster is a dense region of objects that is surrounded by a region of low density In order to handle the different types of clusters and meet the needs of different applications many clustering algorithms have been developed. These can be categorized into partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods, grid-based methods, and model-based methods In many application domains clusters of data objects are of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities, and the number of clusters is unknown. In such scenarios, t raditional clustering algorithms including partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, densitybased methods and grid-based methods, cannot identify clusters effectively or accurately. Obviously, these are critical limitations or weaknesses of cluster ing methods. In order to solve the problem, we proposed a clustering algorithm which has the abilities to find clu sters of arbitrary shapes and sizes, to handle clusters and noise of varyi ng densities, and to identify outliers effectively. The algorith m is called CADD \(Clustering Algorithm based on Density and adaptive Density-reachable CADD   A Relevant Definitions of the Clustering Algorithm 1\he density of data points Given N d-dimensional data points in dataset D  X i where i = 1, 2,É, N. The density of data points models the overall density of a set of points in dataset D as the sum of influence function associated with each point        N j X X d i j i e X Density 1 2  2 2    Here, Gaussian influence function    2 2 2  X   j i X X d j i Guass e X f    indicates the density influence of each data points to the density of point X i and  is density adjustment parameter which is analogous to the st andard deviation, and governs how   2\ocal density attractors: Local density attractors are the data points at which th e values of density function Density\(X  are local maximum 3 is used to determine a circular area of data points x, labeled as   X 0 d  X i X j  R and the data points in the circular area are belong a same cluster.

The adaptive adjustment is carried out through multiplying the original density-reachable distance R with an adjustment coefficient   R R Adap 015   Here R Adap is adaptive density-reachable distance, and  is defined as      1 i i Attractor Density Attractor Density   015  This is because that when the density value of local density attractor of a cluster is greater , the distance between objects in the cluster is smaller, and on the contrary, when the density value of local density attractor of a cluster is smaller, the distance between objects in the cluster is larger. When i 1, let Because   so   1. It is necessary to point out that adaptive adjustment coefficient  may also be other value of function which can adjust the density-reachable distance effectively     1 0 Attractor Density Attractor Density      1 i i Attractor Density Attractor Density   B The Clustering Algorithm The operation of the clustering algorithm consists of the following steps  To calculate the density values of data points in dataset D  using Equation \(1\determine the Local density attractors Density  Attractor i     To compute initial density-reachable distance R using Equation \(2 adjusted by the initial adjustment coefficient of density-reachable distance CoefR   According to the initial density-reachable distance R and  the adaptive density-reachable distance R Adap search data points which belong to local density attractors respectively. In this step, if the number of data points in the area of density-reachable distance is less than MinPts  such as MinPts 5 or 7, the data points are identified as noise or outlier and assigned to noise dataset The process of the clustering algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1   Figure 1 The process of CADD According to the definitions we design and implement the clustering algorithm as below  Algorithm Clustering Algorithm based on Density and adaptive Density-reachable, CADD Input Adjustment coefficient of density- reachable distance CoefR density adjustment parameter   Output Number of clusters, the members of each cluster outliers or noise points 1: Compute the densities of each data points and initial density-reachable distance 2:  i1 3 Repeat  4: Seek the maximum density attractor O DensityMaxi in the original dataset of clustering objects as the cluster centroid of C i  5: Assign the data objects which are density reachable within adaptive density-reachable distance from O DensityMaxi to cluster C i and delete the clustered objects from original dataset 6:  ii+1 7 Until Original dataset is empty 8:  Make the clusters which have few objects \(such as less 5 or 7\into outlier or noise group III D ISTANCE B ASED Q UANTITATIVE A SSOCIATION R ULES  Association rules that contain continuous attributes are commonly known as quantitative rules. There are various methodologies for appl ying association analysis to continuous data. The types of methods mainly fall into three broad categories [1]: \(1 ased methods, \(2 based methods, and \(3\methods. The quantitative association rules derived using these methods are quite different in nature The main concept for creating distance-based association rules is to cluster data ob jects and mine association rules among these clusters according to the distances between the clusters A Clustering It is necessary to point out that if there are a number of clusters in a data space, the strong association rules among attributes just exist in each cluster. Therefore, the creation of association rules just focuses in each cluster. The notion proposed in this section can make the process of quantitative association analysis more simple, efficient and effective We use the clustering algorithm CADD to group the data points in a dataset. For a specifi c set of attributes, restrictions are placed on the properties of these data points when projected on X For this reason, when a cluster is projected on X the cluster is denoted as C X Given N d-dimensional data points  i X   i 1,É,N C X the Clu d as                                    0 R X N CF       Here N is the number of data points in C X      N i i X N X 1 0 1 is the centroid of C X and 59 9 


 2  1 2 0 1    1  X X N R N i i     is the average distance from member points to the centroid or the radius of C X According the clustering feature CF the relationships among clusters projected on attributes are determined as presented later B The Association Rules For a cluster, if association rules exist among the attributes X  x 1 x x and Y  y 1 y y the definition of association rules is x 1 Cx 1  x 1  x x Cx x  x x  y 1 Cy 1  y 1  y y Cy y  y y  led with the attributes on which they are projected. For abbreviation, the rule is presented as Cx 1 Cx x Cy 1 Cy y where all the attributes X  x 1 x x  and Y  y 1 y y are disjoint. The rule Cx 1 Cx x  Cy 1 Cy y  holds with confidence c if i Cx i   j Cy j  Cx i  c The rule holds with support s if i Cx i   j Cy j  s  For distance-based association rules, the confidence c is determined by the distances among the images of clusters Cx 1 Cx x  and Cy 1 Cy y and the support s is dominated by the numbers or densities of clus ters. In this paper, we use the Euclidean distance metric to measure the distance between data points According to the notion proposed by R. J. Miller and Y  definitions of distance-based association rules are as follows Let x 1 x 2 x x and y be pairwise disjoint sets of attributes. A N:1 distance-based association rule \(DAR R  Cx 1 Cx x Cy where each Cx i is a cluster projected on x i and Cy a cluster on Y  R holds with degree of association D 0 if x i D Y Cx Y Cy D i    1      0  j i d X Cx X Cx D i x j j i i    0       Here, we emphasize that Cy  Y  tes the Cy  Cx i  Cx i  Y  s  the image of all data points in the range of Cx i projected on Y  and is the distance between centroids of Cy  Y  and Cx i  Y  pplications, the value of D 0 is determined by the radius of the cluster. Because the creation of association rules is in each cluste r, it is unnecessary to calculate Equation \(7\e define the support S of the association rule as      Y Cx Y Cy D i        Ds Y Cy S   Here Cy  Y  ber N of data points in the cluster, and  Ds indicates the number of all data points in the data space The degree of association replaces the traditional notion of confidence and the density thresh old \(or the number of data points in a cluster\ the notion of support For 2 dementional data space, as sho wn in Figure 2, we discuss the creation of dist ance-based association rules. When there is one cluster in the data space, as shown in Figure 2\(a we can obtain the association rule Cx  Cy  0       Y Cx Y Cy D   X Cx D   1     S 100%, i.e., when the value of X is in the interval of x1  x2  e v a lu e o f  Y is bound to y1  y2  and Cy  Cx  S 100%, i.e., when the value of Y is in the interval of y1  y2 the value of X is bound to x1  x2  2\(b two clusters with same number of data points in the data space and the rules derived from the data space are C1x  Cy  0     X Cy 0  Y x C Y Cy D 0   2     S 50%, and C2x Cy   Y x C Y Cy D Cy X Cx D    2    y C X Cx D  D  2   2   S 50%. If let the degree of association D 0  R radius of the cluster\ we can not derive the rule Cy  Cx because the centroid Ox of Cy  X  located between C1  and C2 and As for Figure 2\(c\we can obtain the rules C1y Cx  S 50%, and C2y Cx  S 50%, but not Cx Cy If the distribution of data points in the data space is as shown in Figure 2\(d on rules derived from the clustering result are C1x C1y  S 50% and C2x C2y  R X       X Cx D 0    X  1   1 X y C X x C 0  0   1  X y C 0    X y C X x C D 0   1   1   S 50 C1y C1x   X x C X y C D 0   2   2   S 50% and C2y C2x   X x C X y C D  S 50 The analysis indicates that th e strong association rules only exist among the attributes in a cluster, and other clusters existed in the data space may weaken or break the association among the attributes in the cluster   a\ One cluster in data space.        \(b\wo clusters parallel with X   c\parallel with Y d\ue crossing axis Figure 2 Association rules in 2-dimentinal data space In this paper, we focus our research to the N:1 distancebased association rules. N:1 distance-based association rules have a number of important applications. Often in data mining we are interested in discovering wh ich attributes determine one of a specific set of target attributes. For example, in geochemical applications, there are many chemical elements which are measured in the field and we have to determine the relationship between a target element and a specific set of elements so as to solve some geochemi cal problems Another example is that in medical domain we also have to research the relationships between a specific sym ptom and other symptoms and so on 600 


C The Association Algorithm The algorithm presented in this section is a modification of the algorithm pr s three phases   In first phase, clusters in the data space are identified using normal clustering al gorithms, such as K-means or CADD [8 a lculated  In second phase, the distances are calculated in a cluster which holds support S here Y is the target attribute chosen by domain experts interactively and X  x 1  x      Y Cx Y Cy D i x are the other attribut es of data points in the data space  In third phase, the rule is fo rmed by combining the clusters projected on a ttribute Y which holds and  0      D Y Cx Y Cy D i         Ds Y Cy S  IV A PPLICATIONS  In the real world applicati on of data mining techniques, we use cluster analysis and association analysis to research the regional geochemical characteristics in a region of western China. The sampling area is 80*72 Km 2 the distance between sampling points and lines is 2 Km, and the number of sampling points is 1517. The lithological distribution pattern in the region is shown in Figure 3 1\ the pale yellow area indicates humus, anemoarenyte and diluvium in Quaternary; \(2 yellow area is sandy and carboni ferous dark gray-colored slate and silty mudstone with siltstone in Dyas; \(3\rk yellow area represents clastic rock, dark gray-colored conglomerate graywacke, and silty slate with silty mudstone in Dyas; \(4 yellow and yellowish-brown-c olored granite porphyry hornblende granite porphyry and masanophyre in Yanshanian magmatism distribute in the pale pink area; \(5 flesh and red-colored granitello and medium-grain granite in Yanshanian magmatism; \(6\the blue area indicates gray and sage green-colored rhyolite, rh yolitic tuff with breccia in Jurassic; \(7\he purple area is dimgray-colored medium and coarse-grain quartz diorite and gneissic quartz diorite in Variscan magmatism; \(8\nd palegray-yellow-colored biotite plag ioclase gneiss with amphibole plagioclase gneiss, quartz schist, shallow particle rock, and griotte  Figure 3 Lithological distribution patter n in the sampling region The purposes of clustering analysis and association analysis are to research the characteristics of regional geochemical anomalies, to determine the distribution of an omaly source, and to analyze the type of mineral resources according to the relationship among the geochemical elements A Cluster Analysis There are 1443 samples actually in the geochemical measurement region, and for each sample 17 kinds of chemical elements are measured which are Ag, Al, As, Au, Cd, Co, Cu Fe, Hg, K, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, Zn. The sampling points constitute a spatial dataset in which each data point has 17 attributes, i.e., Ag, Al, As, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mn, Mo Pb, Sb, Sn, W, Zn. The clustering result of CADD is shown in Figure 4. There are four clusters Cluster1, Cluster2, Cluster3 Cluster4 and Outliers found in the spatial dataset. The distribution pattern of the clu sters is consistent with the lithological distribution patte rn in the region, which can indicate the characteristics of geochemical anomaly. The distribution area of Clust er1 reflects the geochemical characteristics of the dimgray-colored medium and coarsegrain quartz diorite and gneissi c quartz diorite in Variscan magmatism \(the purple area   Figure 4 Clustering result of geochemical samples B Association Analysis Geological survey in the field indicates that mineral occurrences of W and Pb or Cu exist in the area of Cluster1 According to the geochemical th  hem ical characteristics of a geological unit can be evaluated using the association rule of the chemical elements. In this section, we use association analysis to analyze the relationship among the chemical elements so as to determine the characteristics of a geological unit, and provide useful knowledge for mineral resource survey Because the chemical elements Cd and Sb are important indicator elements for the ev aluation of mineral resources, we research the relationships Cd and Sb with other chemical elements using the distance-based association analysis. For Cluster1, when D 0 0.005, the quantitativ e rules are as follows 1\he association rule of Cd with other elements As 1.4 Ag 0.01,0.29  Au 0.3,1  Hg 1.0,120 0.02,4 Pb 5.0 Sb 0.03 Sn 0.1 W 0,8.7 Cd 0.01  D 0 0.005 S 33.6 2\he association rule of Sb with other elements Ag 0.01,0.29  As 1.4  Au 0.3,1  60 1 


Hg 1.0,120 0.02,4 Pb 5.0 Sn 0.1,14], W 0,8.7.0 Sb 0.03,2   D 0 0.005 S 33.6 The association rules indicate that Cd and Sb are related with Ag, Au, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sn and W under certain degree of association and support According to geochemical we can conclude that the mineral resources in the region are related with Ag, Au, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sn and W. The conclusion is consistent with the real characteristics of mineral resources in the region V C ONCLUSIONS  For real world applications of data mining, the key technique is to handle complex data effectively and efficiently The research results indicate that CADD can not only overcome the weaknesses of traditional partitioning and hierarchical methods to handle arbitrary clusters and outliers but also improve the capability of density-based methods to deal with clusters of varying de nsities. At the same time, the algorithm can evidently reduce time and space complexity as compared with other density-based algorithms. In association analysis, mining the continuous attributes may reveal useful and interesting insights about the data objects which are of continuous attributes. Quantita tive association rules aims to deal with the relationships among continuous attributes of data objects. The association analysis algorithm presented in this paper uses a clustering algorith m to identify th e intervals of attributes in clusters and combines the clusters projected on attributes to form distance-b ased association rules held with degree of association and su pport. Experiments and applications indicate that the algorithms of clustering and association are effective in real world applications. In future research, we will do more work in the creation of N:N distance-based association rules, and make the algorithm more effective for processing geoscientific data The research results may provide new methods and techniques for comprehensive interpret ation of geophysical and geochemical data, and minim ize the uncertainness and ambiguity of geoscientific data interpretation. Along with the development of geosciences, more and more data are collected and data mining techniques have ev olved important methods to process huge amounts of geoscientific data and to discover useful geoscientific knowledge efficiently and effectively A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The materials are based on wor k supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No 40762003, and by Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia under Grant No. 200711020814 R EFERENCES   P N Tan M Steinbach and V Ku m a r.
