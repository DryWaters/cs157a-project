Proceedings of IC-NIDC2010 A NEW DESIGN OF SECURITY WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK USING EFFICIENT KEY MANAGEMENT SCHEME Shuai Yang, Jie Liu, Chunxiao Fan, Xiaoying Zhang , Junwei Zou School of Electronic Engineering Beijing University of Po sts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China tjyangshuai@bupt.cn Abstract Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Network \(WSN becoming a hot topic after the çSensor China concept proposed in 2009. Sensor nodes are deployed in a hostile or unattended environment to collect the data inform ation. Therefore, network security has become a big problem. A new key management scheme of security network architecture for wireless sensor network is presented in this paper. The proposed key management mechanism combines trusted-server scheme and key pre-distribution scheme which meets the security requirements of WSN. We also illustrate the new network architecture for wireless sensor network and a typical communication process between two sensor nodes to describe the design idea and implementation. Finally, we analyses the system security and performance of WSN. The results demonstrate the proposed scheme could obtain more shared key and reduce large amount of computations Keywords wireless sensor network \(WSN\urity key management scheme 1  Introduction Recently, Wireless Sensor Network has becoming a hot technological topic with the development of computer science and wireless communication technology, especially after the çSmart Planet concept which was proposed by IBM in 2009 and Internet of Thingsé concept in China. WSN Wireless Sensor Network\means an environment composed of large-scale micro devices which are called sensor nodes h ese sens or nodes a r e battery-constrained, have limited storage memory and computational processing capacity, because they usually need to work many years. Sensor nodes consist of many functions of monitoring a wide variety of surrounding conditions and collecting important data, including magnet, temperature and so on When sensor nodes are deployed in a hostile environment, adversaries can easily listen to the traffic between nodes and intentionally provide misleading information to other nodes. So how to guarantee the security in WSN is becoming especially important. The main idea is how to set up secret keys between nodes. Th is problem is known as the key agreement problem. There are three types of general key agreement schemes: trusted-server scheme, self-enforcing scheme, and key predistribution schem The self-enforcing scheme depends on asymmetric cryptography, which uses public key algorithms such as RSA [3 Diffie-Hellm a n 4  Ho wev e r, it is n o t  practical to use public key algorithms, due to limited storage and computation resources. This paper presents key agreement scheme which is a hybrid between trusted-server scheme and key predistribution scheme. Here we quote the efficient key pre-distribution scheme which is Hui-Feng Huang  proposed in 2007. Compared to Choi and proposed key pre-distribution scheme, this scheme can reduce large amounts of computations and communications for both the key pre-distribution step This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces the present situ ation of WSN. Section 2 shows the new network architecture of WSN that we proposed. Section 3 presents some works includes the proposed key agreement scheme and a typical communication process between two nodes. Section 4 shows the security analyses and the performances of the proposed scheme. Section 5 draws a conclusion 2  New network architecture of WSN The traditional network architecture of WSN is selforganized and flat, so it is not easy to centralized monitor all the devices operation. This paper proposes the new network architecture of WSN, as shown in Figure. 1. It introduces the idea of central control and helps us grasp the network conditions in WSN 504 ____________________ _______________ 978-1-4244-6 853 9 10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE    


Figure 1 Network Architecture of WSN It contains lots of sensor nodes, several small base stations, one big base station, one trusted server and one person monitor system. Here we can also set up a firewall to prevent inner WSN from outer Internet attacks In order to reduce the production cost of WSN, it is practical to lower the process capacity of each sensor node and let trusted server implement the complex computation and key management scheme. Inside the WSN, we can define one cluster including one small base station and all sensor nodes it covers The sensor nodes, which detect and gather data information from environment, are scattered in the sensor field. They are connected by low power radio link. Data are routed back to the base station by multi-hop principle. The small base station can receive data from local sensor nodes and send information to them. It can also communicate with other small base stations by high bandwidth radio link. All the small base stations are wireless linked to the big base station which can broadcast information to all the small base stations. The trusted server stores all the private keys and shared key of devices in WSN. In order to prevent eavesdroppers from disclosing the private key, here we use wired link to connect trusted server and big base station. At last person monitor system can help us to monitor the operation and broadcast information to all the devices in WSN. Any ev ent, including broken devices, collected data information and etc, will appear on the monitorês screen 3  Related works This section presents the proposed key management scheme and a typical communication process between two sensor nodes 3.1 Proposed key management scheme Here we propose a new key management scheme which combines trusted-server scheme and key predistribution scheme. Hui-Feng Hua d an efficient key pre-distributio n scheme in 2007 which guarantees any pair of sensor nodes can find a common private key with simple computation. Based on this scheme, we add a trusted-server to this scheme which can store private key table of all devices, shared key matrix and generate messages which imply shared ke y between two nodes. In order to enhance the security, the proposed approach is to map the used shared key to another one and replace it Once shared key is chosen by trusted server, it will be mapped to another one which doses not exist in the shared key matrix. If the trusted server chooses the same key afterwards, instead of using the same key as the previous one, it will derive a new different key by mapping the original key Supposing there are a number of n neighborhood sensor nodes   12   n NN N and one small base station in one cluster. For each cluster, the trusted server assigned two tables. One contains private key of each sensor node and small base station, and the other contains shared key matrix of all sensor nodes in this cluster. The private key is permanently store in the sensor node or base station when it is manufactured, and you can only use it but donêt know what it is. It seems like USB key of ICBC The scheme is based on the linear comb  and details are as follows 1\rst, the trusted server randomly chooses a positive integer t and a base of form   21 1   n tt t  2\he trusted server generates a shared key matrix of sensor nodes, that is      1            ij ij nn ij ij ji i j k this figure does not make any sense Kk i j k is the shared key between nodes and k k t    012 012    012 012 015   Here, there is no need to assign  ii k a meaningful value, because within our key management scheme the diagonal elements will not be assigned to sensor node as shared public key 3\he trusted server could construct the secret message i S of the form 21 1  2 3   n ii i i in Sk ktkt kt     for 1 2  in  by using n distinct secret keys 1  2    ii in kk k The big base station transmits the secret message i S to specific small base station, and then transmits i S to all the sensor nodes in this cluster. Follows the same procedure j S could also be sent to nodes 4\he two communication nodes i N and j N could compute 505 


  1 mod i ij j S kt t      and  1 mod j ji i S kt t      respectively. Thus  ij ji kk  is a shared private key between i N and j N here the expression of 1 i j S t     is the largest integer less than or equal to 1 i j S t   5\nally, the shared key  ij k   ji k will be mapped to another one which does not exist in the shared key matrix. It can prevent eavesdroppers from disclosing the shared key matrix and enhance the security of WSN 3.2 A typical communication process This section presents a typical communication process between two sensor nodes. Assuming that node A and node B are neighbors, if node A wants to communicate with node B, the main communication process is shown in Figure.2 Figure 2 Main Communication Process between Node A and B In order to describe the communication process more clearly, first we define some symbols. Table 1 displays the notation used in this scheme Table 1 Notation used in this scheme Notion Description i ID the identify number of node i   H one-way hash function i k the private key that only owned by node itself and donêt allow external access. You can only use it but donêt know what it is  i k the key that is    ii kHk  ij k shared secret key that used between two nodes ij M The original request message that represents node i want to communicate to node j. and ij M must meet the prescribed form  ij M the encrypted request message that represents node i want to communicate to node j i S secret information that server sends to node i  k E the symmetric en cryption function using key k  k D the symmetric decryption function using key k t r is a random positive integer and r is bigger than node size The following details will describe the steps that both nodes will take in establishing a secure communication process 1 Supposing that node A attempts to communicate with node B, firstly, node A broadcasts hello message to the base station wh ich can deliver the message to the trusted server 2 Node A computes the encryption key   ii kHk   Here we use the SHA-2 algorithm as hash function Because the popular hash function MD5 \(Message Digest algorithm 5\nd SHA-1 are considered not entirely secured and may ha ve some security threat   1 1  12   3 Using the encryption key  i k node A can encrypt the original request message ij M to be  ij M  Here ij M is the original request message that represents node i want to communicate to node j and must meet the prescribed form. We have to use symmetric cryptography al gorithm due to limited capacity of storage and computation 4 Node A transmits  ij M and itês i ID to the base station which can deliver th e message to the trusted server 5 Searching the private key table of all devices, the trusted server can find the private key i k by i ID  After that trusted server uses the same hash function to calculate decryption key  i k and decrypts out plaintext ij M  6 The trusted server could construct the secret message i S  j S by using secret keys   for 1 2 ij ki j n  The base station transmits the secret message i S  j S to sensor node A and B 7 Using the formula  1 mod i ij j S kt t      and  1 mod j ji i S kt t      node A and node B can compute shared key ij k and ji k  obviously ij ji kk  And then, node A and node B 506 


will send ACK message to the trusted server. After receiving two ACK messages, the trusted server will transmit ACK message to node A and B From now on, node A can transmit data information to node B 8 Currently, the node A could encrypt the data with the shared key ij k using symmetric cryptography algorithm and transmits it to node B 9 Node B could decrypt the data with the shared key ji k using the same symmetric cryptography algorithm. And then node B will send Finished message to node A 10.After receiving Finished message, node A could send Finished message to node B If all the steps finished, a typical communication process between two sensor nodes finished. Figure 3 summarizes the total communication process Figure 3 Typical Communication Process between Node A and B 4  Security analyses and performances of the proposed scheme 4.1 Security analyses The security of this key management scheme is based on hash function, private key and the trusted server In this paper, we choose SHA-2 algorithm as hash function which is considered to have preimage resistant and collision resistant property. If given the output  k it is hard to find any k such that   kHk  Furthermore, it should be hard to find two different messages 12  kk such that     12 H kHk   The private key is permanently embedded in the sensor node when it is manufactured, and you can only use it but donêt know what it is. It seems like USB key of ICBC. This mechanism makes sure that any adversary cannot derive the private key Assuming that one forged sensor node attempts to communicate with node B, if two nodes receive security message i S and j S by using   1 mod i ij j S kt t      we can calculate  ij ji kk   Although the forged node receives the encrypted data using encryption key  ij k it canêt decrypted data using different key  ji k Therefore, this scheme is secure People can monitor all even ts happened in WSN, and the trusted server is totally controlled by person Obviously, it can help us centralized control devices working properly. Therefore, the trusted server must be deployed to the person monitor system where only administrator can maintain it. The shared key matrix is only access by trusted server. Furthermore, if the shared key  ij k is used before, it will be mapped to another one which does not exist in the shared key matrix to enhance the security. Without knowing i S and t, the attacker cannot derive the shared key  ij k between nodes i N and j N  All these mechanism can make sure the scheme is secure 4.2 Performances of the proposed scheme Compared to Huangês key management scheme, the proposed scheme could have more shared private keys to use. So assuming that there exist a number of n neighborhood sensor nodes, the shared key matrix is nn  real symmetric matrix that means ij ji kk  Within our key management scheme there is no need to assign  ii k a meaningful value because the diagonal elements will not be assigned to two sensor nodes as shared public key. So Huangês key management scheme has 2 2 nn  available shared keys to choose. However, my proposed scheme could have 2 2 nn  available shared keys to choose and has n more shared keys than Huangês scheme. For example, when 60 n  Huangês scheme has 1770 keys to choose, but my proposed scheme has 1830 keys to choose Figure 4 shows the comparison of available shared key number between Huangês scheme and my proposed scheme. The results of Figure 4 show that 50 7 


the proposed scheme has more shared keys than Huangês scheme with the number of sensor nodes is from 20 to 100. As a result, this enables to obtain more shared keys to choose for communication Obviously, itês difficult for eavesdroppers to crack the shared private key, and this scheme could enhance the security of WSN Figure 4 Comparison of Available Shared Key Number between Huangês Scheme and the Proposed Scheme with the Number of Sensor Nodes is from 20 to 100 Compared this scheme to Youn al.ês schem 9 scheme. For convenience, I just give simple description of his comparison. You can find detailed analysis in Hui-Feng Huang s defines m T is the time for one multiplication computation d T is the time for one modular division computation. Assuming that there exist a number of n neighborhood nodes   12   n NN N in a designated area. We select   21 1   n tt t  as the base of expression. The value of i t can be pre-computed and stored in the storage memory For the key pre-distribution step, the computational complexity of this scheme is 2 m nT in contrast, Youn al.ês scheme is   32 md On T On T  For computing a common key for any pair of nodes, the computational complexity of Youn al.ês scheme is   m OnT while this scheme is only d T it is obvious that this scheme can reduce large amount of computations 5  Conclusions This paper proposed a new design of security wireless sensor network using efficient key management scheme. We have introduced the new system architecture of WSN, key management scheme and a typical communication process between two nodes. The trusted-server is regarded as the third trusted authority which restore private key and shared key of all sensor nodes. SHA-2 algorithm is used as hash function to generate the encryption key. All these can make sure the security of WSN Finally, we analyses the system security and performance of WSN Acknowledgements The work presented in this paper was supported  by the Special Funds for Key Program of the China No 2009ZX01039-002-0 01-07,Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Build Together Project and Ministry of Education  infrastructure construction project\(2-5-2 References  S.

5  The organizational capabilities that must be developed or refined in order to realize the strategy and support the processes The key benefit of this phase was the link between strategy and the processes that would deliver the strategy The linking of strategy to process had been ignored at the Bank in the past. Objectives and strategy were carefully developed and refined but in isolation from their enabling processes Once linked to strategy the critical processes could be the focus of management attention. Without this phase there was a danger that developing corporate objectives and strategy was a useless exercise as the output tended to get lost and ignored over time and the benefits of the strategy process were shared by a few senior managers The process of developing a Strategy Map and the other related models was regarded as a lot of effort by the reactive managers Their tendency was to get on with it   Give me my targets and let me worry about the rest Reactive managers needed to be coached in the benefits of this phase and also the value provided at the completion of this phase a clearly defined strategy document that could be used to focus the efforts of the staff in their business area 5.2 The Design Phase A variety of models were used in this phase. They tended to be a combination of models that provided alternating macro views \(value chain\ and micro views \(dynamic flow models It should be noted that within the standard BPM implementation models modeling in this phase is limited to the execution layers of process. The macro or contextual views are not included There was a tendency during the Business Process Reengineering phase of the early 1990s to model the entire organization. The approach today is based on the concept of a wiki where the process models are developed over a period of time and added to the repository as required then validated and amended by the stakeholders and integrated into the whole via higher-level models A central repository is critical for this wikibased approach to work effectively The objective of the design phase was to document or design the processes that underpin the execution of the strategy There were multiple benefits associated with the ability to view the process in various forms, from both an end-to-end perspective and at a detailed level Different views of the process were considered Characteristics of the process were reviewed as they were documented for example, the purpose of the process; the triggers, the business rules and so on The dynamic flow models could be used in simulation mode \(discrete event simulation\ to gain further insight into the behavior of the process and to test the effectiveness of the defined process metrics  The deliverables from this phase were a useful  set of semantically correct models approved by those responsible for the processes, the business unit leader or the process owner. Having the processes stored in a trusted central repository ensured that all staff had access to the processes In an organization dominated by a culture of reactive management there is rarely a repository of comprehensive process-related documentation. The impact of not having such documentation stored in a trusted central repository is waste The process documentation tends to be in hard copy form and is generally discarded after the completion of the project. The whole process is repeated six to nine months later when a new project is initiated The impact and cost of not having the organization s critical processes is very difficult to measure. But the result is a lack of shared knowledge on how the business works and constant re-work to document processes when a new project is initiated On the positive side comprehensive processrelated documentation provides a common definition of process across the business area and is invaluable in facilitating and understanding of the business leading to the proactive management of the business processes The biggest issue faced in this phase was \(and remains\ develop appropriate modeling skills in the organization. This included mandating the use of the standard modeling tool \(and modeling notation and discouraging the use of drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio and PowerPoint. This was the biggest challenge as staff found it more time consuming to use formal modeling tools where they were constrained by a particular notation There was a tendency to view processes as having one dimension the process steps in a flowchart This was a byproduct of using process flowcharting methods. Training in business modeling versus process modeling was required but no formal training was offered The key change management challenge was to instill a culture of process thinking in the organization. The goal was to get to the stage where staff used process models to describe how their Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


business worked instead of using an organization chart  5.3 The Implementation Phase Processes that have been documented, designed or re-engineered are deployed for execution in the Implementation phase. The intent is that the processes are executed as they have been documented. However this is rarely the case where the processes are not automated. These processes are called shadow processes and the practice is very difficult to eliminate Processes can be manually deployed using Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\ey can be governed by the execution of application software eg a Loan Processing system or they can be automated using workflow technology If the processes have been designed to align with the organization s objectives and strategies then this is the moment of truth. Effectively designed and documented processes provide the foundation for continuous improvement providing their execution is standardized In the case of the Bank there was little standardization of workflow engines and workflow deployment. The integration of process design and process implementation only occurred in a few areas of the business. The application of workflow technology was generally an outcome of individual projects Ideally the deliverables from this phase are robust, efficient processes the realization of the organization s objectives and strategy. However in reality process execution was disconnected from process design In addition to process deployment the process execution environment must effectively expose the process metrics that are designed in the Strategy Phase and utilized in the Control Phase The key organizational change required to bridge the gap between process design and process execution was closer collaboration between the business and the technology units. The business needed to understand the IT infrastructure required to execute business processes. This required business analysts that had a technical capability On the Technology side, the Enterprise architects needed to work more closely with the business or ideally within the business 5.4 The Control Phase The control phase consists of three sub-phases monitor, analyze and optimize. The control phase requires fairly sophisticated technology to extract the metrics from the process. This phase is also more commonly known as Business Activity Monitoring BAM The monitoring of process performance is extremely important. Once the process is monitored by a suitable tool then it is possible to easily apply and sustain\ Statistical Process Control \(SPC methods to analyze process performance It is essential to establish the degree of stability in a process. Once the process is stable \(under control one can then apply statistical methods to analyse and communicate the behavior of the process. Once the process is stable it is possible to predict the behavior of a process within its control limits \(process capability\. Only then is it appropriate to make adjustments to the process structure in order to control the degree of variation exhibited by the process  The objectives of the Control Phase were to monitor the performance, analyze the process behavior \(variation\nd identity assignable causes and common causes of variation by applying SPC methods  The key benefit was being able to predict the output of the process within the tolerance of its control limits. A secondary benefit was to illustrate the impact of management intervention on the process performance The deliverables included detailed information about the performance of the process based on the execution of the process itself. The metrics were not theoretically derived but were extracted directly during process execution Management dashboards provided the information to the staff who worked on and worked in the processes to support them in executing their tasks and serving the end customers Having facts to guide management decisions had an important impact on the organization. The tendency to blame individuals for poor performance diminished. Instead there was a focus on the process How did the process allow this to occur 11  This attitude was actively promoted by the BPM support unit There were many more benefits. The link between process performance and achieving business outcomes become clear with a greater emphasis on process management The use of Statistical Process Control is traditionally limited to manufacturing organizations Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


However the penetration of Six Sigma has meant that more organizations are being exposed to its practice In a culture of reactive management training staff not to make decisions based on a single data point was critical. They needed to accept the process as it was, ensure it was under control before they started to change the process structures. It was critical that they understood the difference between common and special causes of process variation  6. Discussion and Lessons Learned The extended BPM Lifecycle \(represented by Figure 2\gives the impression that the deployment of the principles and practices of BPM at the Bank was a logical systematic process. This was not the case The initial focus was process modeling and the development of a business architecture without reference to any implementation framework. This situation was aggravated by a major Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative. It was much later that we decided to adopt a BPM framework The framework adopted was based on the standard BPM framework. The issues of governance and ownership and the disconnect between strategy and their corresponding processes were known. These issues and their impact were discussed and the solution of the extended BPM Lifecycle evolved However the BPM Lifecycle, as a framework for the deployment of BPM is now well understood. It can be effectively used by the Bank \(and other organizations\ide their BPM deployment The first research question How effective and practical are the popular holistic BPM models in guiding the deployment and implementation of BPM  can now be answered. Without the addition of the Strategy Phase we were at significant risk of promoting the practices of reactive management by not considering processes in a global and strategic context The issue of organizational change management addressed by the extended BPM Lifecycle focused on changing the culture from reactive management to proactive management. This was \(and still is\e critical issue. The use of the BPM framework to draw attention to this behavior and combined with business narrative were interventions that achieved some success Business narrative was used to overcome the tendency to use rational argument as the only method to encourage change. However Stephen Denning  describes the use of different story structures to support the entire deployment lifecycle.  The use of additional story types in this way has promise and is to be explored later The nature of engagement between the BPM support unit and the business received a lot of attention. It became clear that an expert engagement model was not effective. Although it did produce results these results were not sustained and the business never really owned their business processes An engagement model based on executive coaching and reflective practice showed more promise and was welcomed by the business units. It was a less confronting model based on collaboration and the attitude that the BPM unit was part of the business not a separate area An important issue is the provision of work-place training of BPM staff in executive coaching and reflective practice. This will be critical to the success of the coaching engagement model. The most appropriate method is probably to use coaching and reflective practice to train the BPM coaches. This is an area that needs further research and attention The Strategy Phase was a significant addition to the lifecycle. However the business initially regarded the use of models to document strategy as a lot of effort This reaction was no surprise in the context of reactive management. Reactive managers tend not to be comfortable with analysis Once the sense of effort was overcome they tended to enjoy the process and found it very stimulating and useful. They also had a sense of ownership of their strategy as they have helped to formulate it. They understood a great deal more about how their business worked than they did before participating in the process In the Modeling Phase we learned that it is extremely important to ensure that the users have a positive experience in using a more sophisticated process modeling tool. Training in the use of the tool as well as training in modeling business processes is required. This is equally true for both business and technical staff The models need to be simple and staff need to be encouraged to provide high level models such as value chains to provide a context for the dynamic flow models The key lesson learned is that the processes must be useful to the business if they are to be maintained The intent is to make the process documentation indispensible to the managers as an aid to managing their business. This is achieved by the additional information recorded with the objects that make up the models \(object attributes\he tool used to document the processes must have the ability to maintain attributes that are used to describe the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


process and provide details on each aspect of the process In the Implementation Phase simply having application software that is capable of automating the business processes is not enough. Business representatives need to understand the capability of technology to deploy and automate processes Technology staff need understand business sufficiently to provide them with an awareness of the possibilities that can be derived from process automation and the emerging technology of SOA Finally in the Control Phase implementing a process and business monitoring tool is a complex undertaking. There is a very steep learning curve involved in all aspects from installation configuration, testing and training staff in the use and analysis of the tool It is critical to clearly communicate how each of the Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\ has been calculated and how they should be interpreted and used. The users must trust what they see so it is important to have a transparent validation process in place that can be used to demonstrate the accuracy of the measurements and results. Be prepared for rapid acceptance and understanding from the business and requests for advanced features. This behavior may reflect the penchant of reactive managers to solve problems There are many areas for further research. It would be interesting to profile managers using Kolb s Learning Style Inventory T h is  w o u l d prov ide further insight into the characteristics of reactive versus proactive managers and provide alternatives for intervention strategies. It is possible that a balance of reactive management and proactive management is likely to be more effective than a single management style 7. Conclusion This paper has illustrated the use of a holistic framework, the BPM Lifecycle and its use in the deployment of business process management \(as a management discipline\in a large Australian financial services organization The paper demonstrates that the commonly used BPM models omit two key elements: \(1 Phase and \(2\e important dimension of Governance Ownership and Accountability. Without the link to strategy organizations will tend to focus on local process optimization of process to the detriment of the performance of the end-to-end processes A visionary, competitive strategy that is not linked to operational processes cannot be implemen Effective process management is not possible without appropriate governance and ownership Suitably qualified, experienced and trained staff are required for the role of Process Owner. Their authority to modify or approve modifications must be derived from corporate policy - the formal delegated authority to modify a process The paper argues that the introduction of BPM is further complicated in an organization dominated by reactive-style managers. Converting these managers to proactive-style managers is a major organizational change management imperative Furthermore these managers aren t persuaded by rational argument. More effective approaches such as the use of business narrative must be used to initiate and accelerate the required change Finally an expert engagement model is not effective for deploying BPM. Business executives and their staff require coaching in the application of BPM principles and practices assisted by training in Reflective Practice to internalize the learning The discipline of BPM is extending rapidly assisted by technology advances. The integration of business rules engines into process modeling tools holds the promise of agile processes and redefines the role of risk managers The extended BPM lifecycle is not specific to the financial services industry but could be applied to other industries. It provides a very high level framework. The underlying elements can be adapted to include evolving aspects of BPM including the definition, testing and deployment of business rules and the documentation and management of technology related elements such as web services The journey at the Bank is not complete by any means. It is merely the end of the beginning The major aggravating factor is scale. There are a large number of people, business units and a complex technology platform and an ever changing market environment However the modified and extended BPM Lifecycle has proved to be a useful model to support the introduction and deployment of business process management at the Bank 8.

                                Box 3.1. Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis. The survivor function S\(t time \(T is lt;&lt;?= ttTPtS 0   Note that S\(t function R\(t instantaneous rate of failure at T=t, conditional upon survival to time t.  It is defined as      lim  0 tS tf t tTttTtPt t  lt The above definitions are for univariate survival analysis; survival analysis has been extended to multivariate systems, or the multivariate survival analysis Hougaard 2000, Ma and Krings 2008c 3.7 and 3.8 for Multivariate Survival Analysis  Fundamental Model of Survival Analysis

This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis                                                      Cont' Box 3.1  Another model that is of nearly comparable status with Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
