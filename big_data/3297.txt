I I NTRODUCTION Data is one of the most critical components in the nextgeneration scienti\223c computing 2 T raditional serial computing architecture can\220t satisfy real-time scienti\223c calculation requirements which makes computing structure using parallel architecture become more and more popular such as 
Map-Reduce parallel programing model and its Hadoop implementation Cloud computing is becoming fashion for its high resource utilization feasible node deployment and 224exible resource supply advantages P articularly  data-intensi v e applications can store temporary data on local storage and global data on shared storage which improves effectiveness of data process on cloud computing platform At the other hand convenience for data placement brings some new challenges to cloud computing platform T oo much network resource is costed by information exchange and data transmission between virtual machines which makes network bottleneck of data centers Network congestion lowers 
processing ability of the virtual cluster At the same time cloud computing is under pay-as-you-go model reducing total data transmission in virtual cluster can reduce economic cost for cloud tenants Therefor analyze and optimize performance of virtual cluster according to network cost are becoming more and more important Big data applications always run on hundreds of thousands virtual machines which makes it complex to optimize them from structure aspect In essence all the application structures can be seen as combination of two kinds of basic connections As shown in Fig.1 they are centralized and decentralized structure Centralized structure It is also called master-slave

running in large cluster are hybrid they are constructed by combination of centralized and decentralized structures Therefor we can separate node graph into many subgraphs some of them are centralized while others are decentralized Take Hadoop as an example it has a master node to control all the other nodes in the cluster The master controls job tracker to split the job into many small tasks and hands out these tasks to different slaves which is called map procedure After all the slaves have done their tasks reduce procedure calls for all the tasks mid-results processed by mappers it combines them together to form the nal result Obviously master is connected with all the other nodes as a centralized subgraph and all the mapper nodes are connected as a decentralized subgraph At the same time all the reducer nodes form a decentralized subgraph while reducers are connected with mapper nodes as a centralized structure To optimize performance of the whole cluster we nd the centralized subgraph and put server of the subgraph on the virtual machine whose logical distance with all the other nodes is the shortest After analyzing running scene of virtualized Hadoop in cluster we nd that both the master and the reducer are the kernel of their own centralized subgraph However they are not absolutely in the same kind there is still a big difference between them as shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 Figure 2 and Figure 3 record network throughput of master and reducer when running TeraSort benchmark on virtualized    0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140  160  180  200  0  500  1000  1500  2000

capacity exchanged through this node isnêt large which makes determinate factor of its performance communication latency However when it comes to slave node large amounts of data is transferred into or out of reducer nodes in reduce phase whose determinate factor is not only communication latency but also data transfer ability of connected switches To optimize performance of virtual cluster by distance aware aspect we propose a strategy called vClusterOpt It nds all the centralized subgraphs and deìne logical distance between nodes in the centralized subgraphs These logical distances are separated into two types LCD and LTD LCD is mainly determinate by communication time between nodes while LTD focus on both communication time between nodes and transfer ability of connected switches In this paper we explore deìnition of LCD and LTD and use the shortest LCD and LTD algorithm to choose kernel nodes for system performance optimization We demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithm by exploring performance improvement of PI TeraSort and WordCount benchmarks on Hadoop In Hadoop case we treat the node who has the shortest LCD with all the others as master node while the node\(s with the shortest LTD with all the mappers as reducer node\(s Experiments show that the average process time is reduced by 20 and time of transferring data staying in the virtual cluster network is reduced by 57.67 To the best of our knowledge vClusterOpt is the rst strategy who optimizes parallel structure by analyzing kernel node placement of centralized subgraph This paper is the rst paper to put both communication cost and transfer ability of connected switches into consideration to calculate logical distance between nodes We want this trail can give a sight into cluster performance optimization In this paper we also describe algorithm determining when kernel node should migrate to a new virtual machine according to run-time dataîow change of other applications running in the data center at the same time we put the circumstance that number of virtual machine changes with demand into consideration Our contributions are as follows 1 A new angle of view to optimize performance of complex structure is proposed We use centralized subgraph optimization to improve system performance by putting kernel node of centralized subgraph on the virtual machine whose logical distance with all the others is the lowest 2 We propose vClusterOpt strategy and deìne LCD and LTD to express different logical distances between nodes in virtual cluster We optimize nodes placement strategy in virtualized Hadoop cluster by the shortest LCD and LTD algorithms and demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithm 3 We put both communication time and transmission ability of connected switches together to calculate LTD its the rst paper to use this method 4 We supply strategy to solve state-change phenomenon such as virtual machine migration and scale of virtual cluster change The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II 


describes background and motivation of our paper In section III we give fully explanation about vClusterOpt strategy and deìnition of LCD and LTD then we give solution to statechange phenomenon Section IV demonstrates effectiveness of our vClusterOpt strategy with 6 experiments Related work is analysed in section V Conclusion and future work are promoted in section VI II B ACKGROUND AND M OTIVATION In this section we introduce background of virtualized Hadoop and the motivation we propose vClusterOpt Hadoop is a representative data-intensive application it runs on physical machines under most of the circumstances Since virtualization technology based cloud computing emerges it attracts interests of researchers from academic and industry areas Therefor strategies to put Hadoop on the cloud platform are explored by researchers as shown in Fig.4 Running Hadoop on virtualized cloud computing platform has four advantages 1 High resource utilization Several virtual machines run on one physical server they share physical resource of the server at the same time Manage granularity becomes smaller to get higher resource utilization 2 Feasible deployment Number of virtual machine changes as soon as system demands Virtualized platform can increase or decrease number of nodes in 1s by clone technology of cloud computing 3 Flexible resource supply Not only number of virtual machine can change by demand but also conìguration to virtual machines can change in a short time when it is necessary 4 Effective storage management Local and remote storage can work together to improve cluster performance Users can put temporary data on the local storage and HDFS on the SAN\(Storage Area Network which makes data access faster and data process efìcient However cloud computing also brings some challenges to virtualized Hadoop the most obvious one is also the focus of our paper communication cost Several virtual machines run on a physical server which enlarge communicate pressure of the server by 8-10 times To reduce communication cost two approaches are proposed The rst one is to increase bandwidth of data center however it costs too much to change network foundation of the data center at the same time bandwidth has a limitation it canêt be enlarged as far as you need The second way is to reduce data transmission pressure in the virtual cluster We take the second approach in our research We propose vClusterOpt strategy to reduce data transmission cost in virtual cluster vClusterOpt chooses nodes with the shortest logical distances with others as the kernel node to decrease transfer time between nodes and queuing time in switches Experiments show the shortest logical distance algorithm is an effective way to reduce network cost of virtual clusters         Fig 4 Structure of Virtualized Hadoop III V C LUSTER O PT In this section we give fully description about vClusterOpt strategy vClusterOpt nds centralized subgraphs of the complex application deployment structure at the rst step then it judges that whether the shortest LCD or LTD strategy works well on these centralized subgraphs In this paper we focus mainly on deìnition and calculation of LCD and LTD and strategies to nd the nodes with the shortest logical distance To calculate communication time between nodes in a virtual cluster there are two challenges should be solved At the rst point network topologic structures of various data centers may be different from each other The most popular structures can be represented as three types as shown in Fig.5 Tree structure Fat-Tree structure and VL2 structure  In a netw ork of tree structure e v ery son node connects with its parent nodes directly which makes the trunk backbone of the network Therefor data transform path in Tree Structure is xed However when it comes to Fat-Tree and VL2 structure we donêt know which switch will exchanged data pass through before the data is transformed We can hardly use physical distance to represent communication distance Since the difference between these three structures we must treat the topological structure as a black box to get our algorithm avaliable in all kinds of network topologies At the second point there are not only the application we measured running in the data center but also many other services are consuming physical resources of the data center at the same time Switches connecting with virtual machines are inîuenced by transmission ability cost of other running services All in all transfer ability is inîuenced by other services it is not static We should put transforming ability of connected switches into consideration Switch routers transferring data at different time are not always the same To simplify calculation of transfer ability we treat existing switch-choosing strategies in virtual cluster

Structure of Different Network Topology as smart strategy they are able to choose router with the highest transmission ability At the same time the one who is connected straightly with the calculating node is xed since the network structure is constructed Therefor we just put switches connected directly with the node into consideration when we calculate transfer ability We choose the switch which has the highest transfer ability as the nodeês value if there is not only one switch connected A LCD and LTD Deìnition We give our deìnition about LCD and LTD as shown in deìnition 1 and deìnition 2 Deìnition 1 Logical Communication Distance is a kind of logical distance which measures the length of communication latency between two nodes the longer the distance is the more time it costs on message communication between the nodes Deìnition 2 Logical Transmission Distance is a kind of logical distance which measures the length of data transformation latency between two nodes the longer the distance is the more time it needs to transfer the same amount of data between nodes it is used when data capacity needed to transfer is huge According to deìnition 1 and deìnition 2 we should put two main parameters into consideration to formulate logical distance in data centers 1 Communication Distance Distance in actual reticle is not the best choice for metering physical distance sometimes since the route which data transfers by is not static in Fat-Tree and VL2 topology and material of reticle has large inîuence on transmission speed Response time is also not suitable for this measurement Since calculating response time of every two nodes needs great efforts when number of nodes in the virtual cluster is large At the same time response time canêt represent communication distance when something like network congestion happens Therefor we need a method taking communication latency into consideration and easy to calculate 2 State of Switch Switches in data centers inîuence logical distance of virtual machines who transfer data through them Switches with different bandwidths and run-time ow have different transfer ability Therefor we should put state of connected switch into consideration To calculate communication distance between nodes we use Vivaldi coordinates which is an algorithm to predict round trip time between nodes without contacting them rst Vivaldi coordinates map hosts into synthetic coordinates such that the distance between two coordinates represents communication latency between nodes Vivaldi calculates coordinates by minimizing  i  j  RT T i,j  x i  x j    which means the gap between round trip time and coordinate distance of node i and j  It models this optimization problem into problem to minimize potential energy of spring system according to Hookeês law These nodes are moved a small step in the direction of the force every time to get the best place where the whole spring system has the least potential energy Coordinates calculate formulation is shown in 6 x i  x i     RT T i,j  dis i,j   u  x i  x j  1   c c   2   e i  e i  e j 3 e i  e s  c e    e i  1  c e    4 e s   RT T i,j  dis i,j  RT T i,j 5 dis i,j   x i  x j  6 LCD i,j  dis i,j 7 LCD i   n j 1 LCD i,j 8 In 1 coordinate of node i is amended by the step size of    RT T i,j  dis i,j   u  x i  x j  every time to try to get the place where the spring system has the least potential energy  RT T i,j  dis i,j   u  x i  x j  is called the force vector of the spring  is called adaptive time step In the force vector calculate process RT T i,j represents round trip time between node i and node j  dis i,j means the distance between node i and node j in the mapping coordinate space u  x i  x j  gives direction of the force on the i th node relatives to the j th   is calculated by multiplying a constant fraction c c and the weight balances local and remote error  in 3 e i in 3 updates its weighted moving average of local error in 4 by combining relative error of this coordinates in 5 c e in this formulation is tuning parameter We can predict response time between any two nodes in the network through detecting fewer data exchange among nodes by Vivaldi coordinates LCD has the same value with coordinate distance between nodes After getting the response time representation we propose enhanced method to calculate LTD between virtual machines as shown in 11 


LT D i,j  k  dis i,j   n c 1 s i  s i 9 s i  s bandwidth  s used 10 LT D i   n j 1 LT D i,j 11 In 9 k is a learning factor it represents inîuence deposition between dis i,j and  n c 1 s i s i  It doesnêt need to calculate out exact value of k in vClusterOpt since we just compare total logical distance of a virtual machine with the others to nd the longest one For example we compare LT D i,j and LT D f,h through comparing whether LT D i,j  LT D f,h is larger than 0 or not we translate LT D i,j  LT D f,h into k   n c 1 s i   dis i,j s i  dis f,h s f   which only depends on plus-minus of  dis i,j s i  dis f,h s f   since all the LTDs have the same part of k and  n c 1 s i  Therefor we can simplify the calculation as dis i,j s i  s i represents remaining transfer ability of the switch connected directly with the i th virtual machine LTD in our vClusterOpt platform is in direct proportion to communication distance but in inversion to transmission ability of connected switch B Strategy to Choose Kernel Node Equation 8 shows that LCD is unchanged after the structure of the virtual cluster is static Therefor node with the shortest LCD is certain However transmission ability of switch changes with working state of the whole data center which makes transfer ability of virtual machine unstable Some workloads in other virtual clusters share switches Therefor we should choose the new kernel nodes when SLA is not satisìed according to monitor information We store run-time LTD between every two nodes in a matrix likes 12 LT D i of every nodes can be represented as sum value in the i th row We choose kernel node in LTD model from algorithm 1 We get the determining switch with the largest transfer ability from all the directly connected switches then we calculate LTD with formulation 11        LT D 1 LT D 2  LTD n LT D 1 LT D 1  1 LT D 1  2 LTD 1 n LT D 2 LT D 2  1 LT D 2  2 LTD 2  3     LT D n LT D n 1 LT D n 2 LTD n,n        12 C Solution Running State Change Many virtual clusters run together in a data center they share physical resource such as switch together These virtual clusters have different running characteristics they consume transfer ability of switch at different levels which makes transfer ability of switches connected to server node changes with time We consider this condition and propose an effective solution as shown in algorithm 2 We recalculate the shortest LTD in the virtual cluster every 5 minutes when we nd the SLA of Hadoop is satisìed we migrate virtual machines running the reducer node to the new virtual machine with lowest Algorithm 1 Reducer Node Choose Algorithm Require Inter-machine LCD table  CTable Connected switch table STable Total bandwidth of every switch B  Used bandwidth of every witch U  Number of virtual machines in virtual cluster numVM Number of mapper node numMapper Number of reducer node:numReducer Ensure  We treat VMs as reducer node when the sum LTD with all the mapper VMs is the shortest 1 for each i  1 numVM  do 2 for each s  1 sizeof  STable  i  do 3 if STable\(i,s is the max in Stable\(i then 4 S  s  5 end if 6 end for 7 for each j  1  numM apper  do 8 LT D  i j  CTable  i j    B  S   U  S   9 nLT D  i  nLT D  i  LT D  i j   10 end for 11 end for 12 reducer   minimum  nLT D   numReducer   13 return reducer  logical distance With the aid of virtual machine migration technology we can solve running state changing problem in a short time Algorithm 2 Solution to Running State Change Require LTD table  LTable Ensure  We refresh the distance matrix every 5 minutes but  change the server node of the virtual cluster only when  SLA of Hadoop is triggered 1 while true do 2 LT able new  refresh  LT able   3 wait\(300 4 end while 5 if SLA  boundary then 6 server   serverChoose  LT able new  numReducer   7 return server  8 end if D Solution to Scalability Change Scalability of virtual cluster will change during running process some times there are 2 reasons 1 Some virtual machines in virtual cluster doesnêt work well for emergency cloud manager must reallocate a new virtual machine to complete its task or redispatch the task to other running virtual machines 2 Cloud managers use elastic compute strategy to change number of virtual machine instances dynamically for higher resource utilization and proìt This phenomenon can be solved by LTD table recalculation however if we recalculate the graph too often much

virtual machines they are not precise enough to represent logical distance VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we present a novel strategy named vClusterOpt to optimize performance of virtual cluster We nd out centralized subgraphs of node graph in virtual cluster and choose kernel node of the subgraphs with the shortest logical distance To get the kernel node precisely we deìne LCD and LTD to represent logical distance LCD represents distance concerning much information exchange but size of changed data isnêt large while LTD highlights nodes who have the most transmission pressure it depends not only on communication cost but also on remaining transmission ability of connected switches We use the shortest LCD and LTD algorithm to optimize performance of virtual cluster Experiments show that optimization base on the shortest LCD and LTD algorithm can improve performance of virtualized Hadoop cluster by 20 Specially performance improved by our strategy increases as data transmission becomes larger Structure of Hadoop in this paper is known and centralized subgraphs are chosen artiìcially We will explore a method to nd centralized subgraph of the complex node graph automatically in the future study It will discover centralized subgraph and central nodes even though the structure of running application is unknown In the Hadoop case study we use manipulation to demonstrate effectiveness of the shortest LCD and LTD algorithm which evades inîuence by other applications running in the data center at the same time We will verify our method in a larger distributed real-world cluster and get some running metrics of online workloads instead of benchmarks to demonstrate that vClusterOpt works well on trans-regional cluster We suppose that data transferred out of every mapper is the same in this paper We will consider the circumstance that task amount of different mapper nodes is different which means that data transferred from mappers are

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

  17 and the SNR is given by    17  The SNRs for all 4 channels, calculated as is discussed here in detail for the 1.61 \265m channel, are shown  in Figure 22 The SNRs for the 4 channels; the radiance in units nW/\(cm 2  sr cm 1 or cos\(SZA\5 in the 4 wave length regions the noise coefficients R 0 and R 1 and the median values cos\(SZA\ from the GOSAT mission for years 2009 \226 2010  d corres pon di n g  g e oCA R B S N R s are l i s t e d i n T a bl e 8. Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
