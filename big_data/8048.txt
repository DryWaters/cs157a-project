R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  among the digital natives and millennials the DTL 1 systems and environments of contemporary times lack the necessary sophistication Physical learning spaces enable interactive environments with a number of important features that are dif\034cult to mimic in virtual and distance learning environments The distance learning environments of today are unable to connect teacher to the learner at the same level and quality that physical spaces could provide For example it is dif\034cult to monitor and manage virtual and distance learning environments due to the absence of physical presence of the learner and teacher at the same place It may be possible to create realistic interactions between the teacher learner and the learning environments but these require a systematic approach for collecting and harnessing data related to these learning environments and their users Physical spaces and their interactive environments are organized and conducted by humans it is dif\034cult to mimic human intelligence in virtual and distance learning environments There is a need to embed cognitive abilities in the DTL systems in order to serve the needs of the next-generation learners Also a DTL system would typically provide learning content via videos and virtual reality media in addition to textbased and voice-based content This would require IP and other networks based communication Therefore planning of resources and scalability of a distance learning system is another major challenge given the large-scale data computational and networking requirements discussed above The agility of the infrastructure is also important Moreover the system should allow accessibility from a broad range of devices and networks Another development that is relevant to the topic of this paper is around the concept of smart cities because it relates to the environment of the learner in which they live learn work and socialise Smart cities provide the state of the art approaches for urbanisation having evolved from the developments carried out under the umbrella of knowledge-based economy and subsequently under the notion of digital economy and intelligent economy  Smart cities e xploit ph ysical and digital infrastructure as well as the intellectual and social capital for urban and social development A city can be de\034ned as smart when investments in human and social capital and traditional 050transport\051 and modern 050ICT\051 communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality of life with a wise management of natural resources through participatory governance Komninos de\034nes smart cities as  territories with high capacity for learning and innovation which is built-in the creativity of their population their institutions of knowledge creation and their digital infrastructure for communication and knowledge management Technically smart cities are complex systems of systems that rely on converged and ubiquitous infrastructures 1 In this article we adopt the term Distance eTeaching and eLearning with the abbreviation DTL to refer to the broader concepts incorporating Teaching  Learning 050T&L\051 through ICT-based distance education The notion of smart cities can be extended to smart society i.e a digitally-enabled knowledge-based society aware of and working towards social environmental and economic sustainability We note that knowledge and human and social capital are at the heart of smart city and smart society developments Therefore we believe that the role of distance learning would extend beyond the mainstream education for employment scope It will extend to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary Motivated by the disruptions and emerging requirements of the education industry and considering the challenges discussed above in this area we propose in this paper a personalised UTiLearn 050Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning\051 Framework UTiLearn is DTL framework designed for enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in smart city and smart society settings The UTiLearn framework leverages on emerging technologies to provide an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments businesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register for a course or programme or she may register her goals learning levels and timelines with the system and the system suggests the learner the available courses or programmes based on her personal preferences and monitors her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual DTL services that MOOCs typically offer a certain group or a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes such as to change people behavior towards better driving practices or healthy lifestyle The UTiLearn framework uses IoT as part of the digital infrastructure needed to connect with the user for personalisation and optimisation of teaching and learning Mobile computing technologies are used to connect to the users sense their continuous activities and provide them anytime anywhere opportunity for DTL Big data technologies are used to deal with the challenges related to the volume velocity and other characteristics of the DTL data Computational Intelligence including deep learning is used for analysis prediction personalisation optimisation and decision making HPC technologies are needed to deal with the high computational requirements of AI and other algorithms Cloud technologies are used to deal with the agility scalability and ubiquity of the framework The UTiLearn Framework could be implemented on top of a hybrid cloud IaaS 050infrastructure 2616 VOLUME 5 2017

city technologies could be used to bene\034t from converged social and national infrastructure in order to provide integrated enhanced and optimized pedagogies content delivery and better cognition for the users Moreover based on the proposed framework we develop a system called the UTiLearn system A prototype implementation of the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components is described and evaluated in this paper The UTiLearn framework and its algorithmic re\034nement comprising 034ve components is discussed in Section 3 and the subsequent 034ve sections detail the function the methodology implementation and evaluation of the 034ve components The purpose of the 034rst component the Sentiment Analyser discussed in Section 4 is to analyse social media for forming the business case of the decisions taken by the system on strategic tactical operational and real time levels The User Activity Recognition  User Identi\034cation 050UARI\051 Component detailed in Section 0 analyses user activity data acquired from IoT devices to understand and predict spatio-temporal activities and other patterns of the user The Adaptive Content Delivery Mode Adviser 050ACDMA\051 in Section 6 leverages the user activity and identi\034cation related information produced by the UARI component to optimize the DTL material delivery and the system and network performance The System and Network Provisioning  Demand Prediction 050SNPDP\051 Component uses the information produced by ACDMA to compute predict and manage the system and network resources required by the UTiLearn system 050see Section 7\051 The Performance Analysis Prediction and Intervention 050P2AI\051 Component informs UTiLearn users about their performance and intervenes as necessary All 034ve components of the system are designed to optimise personalisation for individuals as well as performance for the UTiLearn he system We have carried out a detailed literature review of distance and eLearning systems and reported the challenges that future DTL systems face today We used this information to develop the UTiLearn framework and a proof of concept system based on the emerging technologies To the best of our knowledge we have not found any DTL framework or system that addresses the breadth of issues as addressed by UTiLearn Data Algorithms Software and Hardware We have a used a total of 11 publically available datasets including Twitter data news media data seven activity recognition datasets telecommunication networks and applications traf\034c data and data from edX 050a collaborati v e ef fort of Harvard and MIT\051 We have used the R statistical platform for modelling analysis and decision making of all the data and processes in our UTiLearn system The data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making methods used in the prototype implementation of the UTiLearn framework include Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and deep learning arti\034cial neural networks 050DLANNs\051 The experiments were carried out on a supercomputer called Aziz a Fujitsu made machine with peak performance of 230 tera\035ops comprising 11,904 cores in 496 nodes Aziz was ranked the world's top 491 supercomputer in November 2015 Top500 competition 050http://www.top500.org/\051 Section 2.2.1 gives a background on the technologies used in this research and reviews the relevant literature Sections 3 to 8 introduce the UTiLearn framework and its proof of concept including the function the methodology implementation and evaluation of the UTiLearn system Section 9 concludes this paper and gives future directions II BACKGROUND MATERIAL AND LITERATURE REVIEW We now give a brief background of the emerging technologies used in UTiLearn followed by a detailed literature review in Section 2.2 A TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND 1\051 INTERNET OF THINGS 050IoT\051 The Internet of Things 050IoT\051 refers to a global infrastructure for the information society enabling advanced services by interconnecting 050physical and virtual\051 things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies IoT w ould mak e our en vironments smarter by providing sensing and control capabilities at a 034ne-grain level The data generated by IoT would grow exponentially as the number of things is expected to reach the 50 billion mark by 2020 The IoT data w ould allo w us to comprehend and manage complex environments make better decisions increase automation and enable higher productivity and ef\034ciencies W e will see in this paper ho w IoT could enhance DTL theory and practice 2\051 BIG DATA Big data technologies refer to the emerging technologies that are designed to extract value from data having four Vs characteristics volume variety velocity and veracity Big data is revolutionizing most aspects of our lives be it work or social interactions IoT would be a major contributor of big data A major challenge is the management of big data and timely analyses of big data in order to extract reliable insights and other value from big data Big data would play an important role in next generation DTL technologies 3\051 AI AND DEEP LEARNING The use of computational intelligence including arti\034cial intelligence 050AI\051 has seen tremendous growth in the last decade and this would continue to grow at a much faster pace in the coming years 050see e.g This is mainly due to the increasing capacities and decreasing costs of computing infrastructure We have mainly focused on deep learning a sub\034eld of AI in this paper Deep learning technologies also known as deep structured learning have made remarkable progress recently and its use has grown in diverse areas including computer vision bioinformatics speech VOLUME 5 2017

produced signi\034cantly better results than other AI methods including machine learning 13 14 4\051 HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING 050HPC\051 High Performance Computing 050HPC\051 most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation in order to solve large problems in science engineering or business The other terms similar to HPC are supercomputing and parallel computing The term distributed computing typically has a different focus but in future it is expected to converge with HPC The use of HPC initially was restricted to some specialized applications such as in engineering oil and gas due to the high cost of HPC machines However HPC is now being applied to many diverse areas including social media mining The use of HPC in the education industry is also expected to grow in the near future Mobile computing has already been widely used in DTL It allows close interactions with the user collection of leaner related preferences and other data personalization and improved delivery of learning Cloud computing allows system agility The AI technologies and big data would come together to extract novel insights and make better decisions from data collected through IoT and other means in smart environment settings including the DTL environments Big data would affect the future network traf\034c and hence the network architectures and this also needs to be taken into account while designing a DTL system The use of the technologies 050discuss above\051 in the UTiLearn system would become clearer as we explain our framework and system B LITERATURE REVIEW Modern day learning and teaching techniques are gone beyond the boundaries of conventional classroom teachings of the schools and universities ELearning which is conducted via electronic media speci\034cally with the help of internet is seen today as a key component to provide better learning experience to individuals beyond any age boundaries and enhancing teaching skills of the tutors Learning management systems 050LMSs\051 are the examples of popular eLearning tools Typically LMSs are web-based platforms which provides the functionalities like recording lectures course content design documents download and uploads student registration feedbacks student development planning and skill gap analysis ELearning is becoming popular  ho we v er should not be seen as a replacement of traditional learning In broader terms ELearning is the virtualization of the traditional learning and teaching via internet with additional attributes like better planning and management through data analysis ELearning can be classi\034ed into three sub branches as illustrated in Fig 1 which are FIGURE 1 An eLearning taxonomy 017 Semi-classroom In this form of learning some part of teaching is classroom based and remaining is remote site 050home\051 based 017 Distance Classroom In this learning mode classroom is at remote site other than actual university site Tutor is present at university site and teaching activates are facilitate by electronic media using internet 017 Anytime and anywhere There is no dedicated remote classroom Individual can access this lecture anywhere which is independent of time Anytime and anywhere learning is the most 035exible form of eLearning Cognitive motivational and environmental factors play critical role in assuring the effectiveness of the eLearning systems Cogniti v e f actors describe learner decision making ability that regulate processes in controlled learning environment  Moti v ation-related f actors include personal goal orientation personal attribution of success and personal attitude toward performing a learning task 23 While cognitive and motivation-related factors have received increasing attention in recent research few studies have directly examined the environmental context's in\035uence on learning effectiveness Environmental factors include the structure and content of a course as well as learning conditions that may moderate the effectiveness of learnercontrolled instruction 25 Ho w to trap all these f actors is challenging aspect of eLearning applications and allot depends on these factors that how learner perceive the systems The eLearning market is showing great potential around the world It is growing at a slow but steady rate 27 around the world The growing acceptance rate of eLearning solution both by institutions and students is also attracting more research and developments by industry 1\051 DISTANCE ELEARNING AND LEARNER COGNITION Designing a DTL system which is ef\034cient is essential for its acceptance and its success Moreover with a carefully designed system student can perform better Leach and Walker in re vie w some of the DTL models while gi ving stress on internet based adult learning Whereas Mayes and Freitas in their in-depth review of eLearning models suggested that cognition can play important role in producing desired learning outcomes The objecti v e of their work was to give a detailed account of the presuppositions about learning that support current eLearning models in practice Thus the work tried to achieve mapping of theoretical contexts onto pedagogical models Authors endeavor to 2618 VOLUME 5 2017 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  demonstrate how these mappings have been attained from the three broad theoretical contexts 0501\051 associationist 0502\051 cognitive and 0503\051 situative The associationist is de\034ned as learning as activity and situative perspective is de\034ned as learning as social practice Thinking perception learning language and reasoning are the products of student's consciousness ability to remember and forming processes through concepts has been seen as a shift in psychology in 1960s The approach is student dependent rather than population dependent This added a complete new dimension to pedagogy which is student centric based on students conscious intellectual activity such as remembering reasoning and thinking termed as cognitive which means learning as achieving understanding Further in authors presents an e xtensi v e re vie w of DTL developments based on technology pedagogy theory policy accessibility design environment and management domains This work illustrated the recent and past DTL trends 2\051 DISTANCE ELEARNING FRAMEWORKS Motivation plays an important in the learning process Positive motivation enhances better understanding of topics among the students MENTOR is one of the such multi-media based adaptive online DTL framework It retains positi v e emotions in students by proving user friendly personalised environment for learning which based student's emotion sentiment and personality Another DTL model is proposed in where authors inte grate both co nstructi vist and objectivist approaches to instructional design When creating or redesigning courses for Internet distribution content and media developers faculty and researchers bene\034t from the identi\034cation of a developmental model taking into account both learning and design principles Bong and Zhang proposed read re\035ect display and do 050R2D2\051 DTL framework particularly for online learning Online learners hav e one uni v ersal characteristic that they have diverse learning preferences The 034rst component of R2D2 have methods to assist the learners to gain knowledge through internet based media For example readings virtual explorations and online audio lesson and podcasts The second component of R2D2 model uses the re\035ective activities of the learner such as online blogging and selfassessment quizzes The third component is based on representations of the learning content such as animations to visually present the content The fourth and the last component accentuates what learners can accomplish with the material in hands-on activities such as real-time cases and scenarios Further R2D2 model is explored in As the 034nding suggests that R2D2 model is not ef\034cient in terms of data collection methods However it shows positive learning effects with vocabulary pronunciation acquisition note taking and presentations by the students In China online learning faced problems initially First teachers 034nd hard to adapt and secondly students particularly adult students feel over-burdened with allot of learning content To address these issues in paper a frame w ork is proposed which assist students in interacting with an automated question answering system This helps the teacher to analyze different learning patterns of the students Further teachers are able to organize online learning contents Data mining is used to help both teachers and students to personalize the services Another DTL framework proposed in which e xploits data mining to help teachers to manage the learning contents on the web using available infrastructure needs and experience Later learning content can be reorganized according to student's performance 3\051 SOCIAL MEDIA AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS Social media 050SM\051 has gained a great deal of popularity during the last decade 050see e.g No w it is not merely a platform that is used to do social communication but now it is more like an online world which is used by everybody such as individuals businesses and governments Now businesses are using SM such as Twitter Facebook Instagram and blogging to advertise their product and services to give special offers as per user preferences Last year in American elections we have already seen how SM is used by people to form an opinion about particular candidate A ne w dimension of SM is now shaping up to form a completely new segment in its services i.e distance eLearning In the work found out that younger generation is too enthusiastic for using SM for distance eLearning The factors of this increasing enthusiasm is based on SM eLearning perception convenience academic reasons easiness and collaboration by social networking which are same as analysed in The work also highlights the interests of students and teacher towards using SM for eLearning as they believe it will ease and enhance communication and collaboration between different eLearning entities The results of and 40 see similar trends as shown in earlier work which highlight the popularity of social networking and its possibilities as an education tool in Romania A more recent work which focuses on SM aspect in actively encouraging cognitive and meta-cognitive learner development while using a heutagogical teaching and learning approach This work also indicated that familiarity of students with SM is an important factor that encourages use of SM in eLearning From course design perspective the use of SM is increased in preparing new eLearning courses and packages These literatures demonstrate that SM can play an important role in distance eLearning thus must be explored further with new analyses and approaches Sentiment analysis 050SA\051 refers to analyzing the text to 034nd out key insights about the opinion of the particular entity with respect to speci\034c topic This is achieved by computational linguistics algorithms that extract particular speci\034c subject related information using social media 050SM\051 data like tweets Facebook message Tag lines blogs and online articles The main goal of SA is to determine the opinion attitude and sentiment of a writer regarding speci\034c topic Current issues trends and future prospects of SA are discussed comprehensively in surveys 45 P apers also highlighted the VOLUME 5 2017 2619 
 


R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  importance of public opinion mining in modern day world and its social and commercial aspects For example businesses are using SA to perceive customer's product buying choices by their online SM behaviors This is achieved by analyzing tweets Facebook posts blogs tag-lines etc In one of such w orks SA is done for political e v ents lik e elections Psychometric instruments are used to extract six different types of sentiments such as anger depression confusion fatigue tension vigor Whereas in nodes based SA using graphs has been done that highlights social connection and their correlation Multi-language SA is always an issue because most of the SA models are hard to extend for other languages Addressing this problem in which uses simple heuristics and minimal linguistic computation is performed to make it easily extendible to other languages SVM classi\034er is further used to demonstrate high performance of this model Sentiment analysis is applied to various 034elds to grasp the insights for mass opinions such as 034nance entertainment industry 50 51 politics 52 sales 53 and b usiness operations 54 The literature review given above clearly shows that SA and Social media sentiment analysis 050SMSA\051 are playing critical roles in planning and policy making for businesses 4\051 IoT AND REMOTE LABORATORIES With the emergence of Internet of Things 050IoT\051 DTL can take the leverage from IoT's infrastructure and networking technologies to provide any-time any-where learning solutions to individuals Several different perspective of IoT enabled learning activities are discussed by Adorni et al in their work Undoubtedly in recent years IoT is matured and practical applications of IoT are successfully deployed around the world This is due to the two main reasons 0501\051 IoT is getting wider acceptance from the users as well as the industry and 0502\051 hardware manufacturing cost is coming down with mass productions of sensors processors actuator and other enabling devices Now affordable mobile devices are in market and introduction of Internet Protocol version 6 050IPv6\051 provides far more bigger addressing space so that billions of IoT enabled Things can use it Both internet availability and use have increased several folds and it is reaching the remote areas around the world The integration of IoT with DTL can be far more bene\034cial than what we think today 57 W e will see later in this paper the use of IoT in our UTiLearn system for personalisation system optimisation and higher quality of experience An important area where IoT applications and infrastructure can be used to enhance DL is by developing remote laboratories It is often seen that schools and universities in urban areas have well established and well maintained laboratories However in rural or under developed areas laboratories are not available or available with limited and poorly maintained resources Also the idea of setting laboratories in remote areas does not sound economically feasible due to the small number of students per geographic area In the past students who are enrolled in DTL courses had to go to traditional and physical laboratories to gain practical knowledge and skills Currently thanks to the advances in networking and communication technologies programmers programming languages new eLearning tools are available to make the best use of learning methodologies such as DL Web-based remote laboratory 050WBRL\051 is one of them WBRL is an application which allows students to work with real laboratory equipment's to perform their experiments To facilitates this learner only need a computer with an Internet connection However emerging technologies and other hardware such as mobile devices cloud computing and IoT require the design of different models to support innovative learning experiences For this reason remote labs are being reconsidered to smart device paradigm Physically the considered smart device is made of the junction of a controller 050computer server\051 connected to physical equipment on the one hand and to the Internet on the other hand In authors examine four emerging trends in the Internet that have the potential to in\035uence the development of WBRL the real-time web and one of them in IoT geographically distributed collaboration and scienti\034c work\035ows Each of these trends is examined and discussed and a suggested research and development path is offered Similarly in author describes the process to translate a traditional remote Web lab into a set of smart devices which are able to work together in the cloud and IoT Further in authors have highlighted IoT technologies including actuators web cameras sensors RFID and Arduino which are used to provide WBRL facilities particularly in South African environment 5\051 ACTIVITY RECOGNITION  BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS Understanding of leaners or students remote environment can provide key insights about when and how to deliver learning material lessons and instructions Further DTL systems develop learner dependent cognitive These cognitive can later be utilized for planning student speci\034c lessons One of the such technology is of activity recognition facilitated by using IoT's infrastructure Acti vity recognition assists in developing better cognitive about learner's behavior and daily routines Once the understanding is achieved DTL system can deliver lessons in an adaptive manner rather than 034xed schedule to the students For example with the help of activity recognition we identi\034ed student is free and not busy in any sort of work and not resting even This prompt the DTL system to deliver some important short lesson on his mobile device this is only done at the time when student is free This sort of learning will be very useful for the people who are working as well as registered in DTL courses Other example is by activity recognition DTL application can record student body language and nervous monuments Whereas in the other scenario where the student solving a online exams smart watches can be used to analyze his heart beat which is connected to learning application Further heart beat records corresponding to answering time can be studied to 2620 VOLUME 5

INTELLIGENCE IN DISTANCE ELEARNING AI gained by machine learning 050ML\051 and Deep learning 050DL\051 methods nowadays applied in almost every 034eld of our environment where we are living today The use of ML methods for data mining 050DM\051 is quite old in DTL 034eld However their initial implementations addressed simple applications in DTL  lik e web access pattern mining to customize DTL systems as per individual requirements and OnLine Analytical Processing 050OLAP\051 of student data Further in and 67 ML classi\034ers are used to identify f actors which in\035uence the performance of the students in DL This assists to upgrade DTL systems for better learning outcomes One of the major problem in DTL courses is higher student dropout rates as compared to traditional classroom learning which is addresses using various classi\034ers such as Naive Bayesian 050NB\051 k-Nearest Neighbor 050KNN\051 Decision Tree 050DT\051 Support Vector Machines 050SVM\051 and Arti\034cial Neural Network 050ANN\051  Literatures abo v e are purely based on providing data mining functionalities based on student historic records However modern day DTL systems requirements are far more beyond data mining One issue with in past DTL systems is the absence of auto guide which can instruct teachers to point out problems and possible solutions An arti\034cial advisor is used in to solve this problem which utilizes fuzzy logic It is known that around the world students face hardship in learning mathematical concepts and 034nd it dif\034cult to use them for problem solving One of such system which addresses this by using AI power is ARTIMAT It is based on the idea to enhance mathematical problem solving abilities of the students Further in AR TIMA T is e v aluated and 034nding suggest that it ease mathematical problem solving procedure for the students and understandability of the mathematical concepts among the students Present day DTL systems are far more capable user friendly and automate We believe that integrating new technologies like IoT and AI can be useful for DTL systems III UTiLearn PROPOSED FRAMEWORK We introduce in this section our UTiLearn framework give its overview and present its algorithmic re\034nement UTiLearn is a distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 framework designed for enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in smart city and smart society settings The framework is depicted in Fig 2 and is further elaborated in Fig 3 Moreover we have developed a system called the UTiLearn system based on the proposed framework A prototype implementation of the UTiLearn system is described and evaluated in the next 034ve sections 050Sections 4 to 8\051 The UTiLearn framework leverages on advanced and emerging technologies 050big data HPC AI IoT mobile computing and cloud\051 to provide an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments businesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes The roles are not exclusive for example an individual or organization could be both teacher and learner based on her expertise contributions and requirements A learner might need to learn a speci\034c skill so she registers its interests goals learning levels and timelines with the system The system then suggest the learner the available courses or programs and monitors her through to the completion of the learning task The system would maintain a pro\034le for each user over time and use the pro\034le to understand the user preferences and other cognitive abilities The individuals could also contribute teaching material in the areas of their expertise A rating system could be maintained for individuals and their contributed material based on user satisfaction Certain groups or a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people or the whole population to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes An example is the change of people behavior towards better driving practices cycling or healthy lifestyles Third parties could also provide their services in bridging the service gaps that

of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
