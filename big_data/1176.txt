In 2012 a new initiative to restart the debate on major grand challenges for modeling and simula-\ntion \(M&S as ubiqui-\ntous simulation, high performance computing, spatial simulation, big simulation, human behaviour multi-\ndomain design, systems engineering, cyber systems, network simulation and education.  To contribute nfurther to this initiative, this paper presents M&S Grand Challenges from an Operational Re-\nsearch/Management Science \(OR/MS value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based simu-\nlation and simulation analytics. \n1 INTRODUCTION \nGrand Challenges can bring together researchers to revolutionize a field.  One can turn to astronomy and \nphysics to see how Grand Challenges are being met as scientists collaborate on huge problems that are \nenabling us to better understand the fabric of our Universe from the large to the small.  Modeling & \nSimulation \(M&S domains.  However, M&S has its \nown Grand Challenges that can bring great benefit to researchers and practitioners alike.  The first major \nevent to reflect on M&S Grand Challenges was the Workshop on Grand Challenge for Modeling & Simu-\nlation \(M&S Schloss Dagstuhl 2002 held.  These were \nat the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference in Berlin, Germany \(Taylor et al. 2012 Symposium on \n1269978-1-4799-3950-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson n \nTheory of Modeling and Simulation \(TMS’13 Taylor, et al. \n2013a and at the first SIGSIM-PADS conference in Montreal, Canada \(Taylor et al. 2013b that are emerging are diverse: overall M&S methodology, interaction of \nmodels from different paradigms coordinated modeling, multi-domain design, parallel and distributed \nsimulation, agent-based M&S, ubiquitous computing, supercomputing, grid computing, cloud computing, \ncloud-based M&S, big data and complex adaptive systems, “big” simulation applications \(data, models, \nsystems replicability, embedded simulation for real-time decision \nsupport, systems engineering, simulation on-demand simulation-based acquisition, simulation interoper-\nability, simulation composability, high speed optimization, web simulation science, spatial simulation, \nubiquitous simulation, cyber systems, network simulation, democratization and education.   \n To continue the Grand Challenge debate, this paper presents views on M&S Grand Challenges from \nan Operational Research/Management Science \(OR/MS discusses simulation in \nhealthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based simu-\nlation and simulation analytics. \n2 SALLY BRAILSFORD: ARE GENERIC HOSPITAL SIMULATIONS POSSIBLE? \nPeople who know me well will know that one of my “hobby-horse” topics is the lack of widespread im-\nplementation of simulation modeling in healthcare systems \(Brailsford, 2005 argue with \nthe statement that simulation has been widely applied in healthcare over the past fifty years Eight years \nago, a literature search on Web of Knowledge \(WoK models of \nEmergency Departments \(Brailsford, 2005 2009 search car-\nried out in 2007 on JSTOR, SCOPUS and WoK, on the search string “\(health-care OR health care n\(modelling OR modeling OR simulat*OR \(system AND dynamic keywords. This search resulted in 176,320 hits, and when repeated over successive days the \nbody of literature was found to be expanding at the rate of 30 papers per day.   A recent systematic review \nby Hulshof et al 2012 dating back to the 1980’s \(Wilson, 1981; Jun et al., 1999; Fone et al., 2003; Hulshof et al., \n2012 report that despite a plethora of one-off applications in the academic literature, very few papers \nreport the practical outcomes of implementation or sustained adoption of these models. Indeed, Fone et al. \n\(2003 comment that “… we were unable to reach any conclusions on the value of modelling in health \ncare because the 


evidence of implementation was so scant.” \(p333 is not being used in healthcare systems at all: \nfor example, much of the work in the UK \(and, I suspect, the US and other countries as well in the academic literature. However, it is \nundeniably true that simulation and modeling methods are not routinely embedded in the healthcare man-\nagement toolbox in the same way that they are in the military or in manufacturing industry \(Naseer et al., \n2008 that healthcare is financed, organized \nand delivered in any particular country. \n There are many theories as to why this should be the case. Is healthcare special in some way? Of \ncourse, when we are modeling a hospital we are not modeling inanimate widgets on a production line but \nhuman beings who are often in extremely stressful situations. The culture in healthcare organizations is \ndefinitely different, although surely not so vastly different from the culture in other service organizations \nwhere safety is critical, such as the airline industry. Human behavior cannot be neglected, even in manu-\nfacturing models.   \n It is perfectly understandable that academic research should be published before the work has had \ntime to achieve its full benefit. Academic career incentives \(publish or perish have to publish quickly and then move on to the next project. There have \nbeen very few incentives to follow up with research users on implementation, although in the UK the \n2014 Research Excellence Framework \(the process by which the Government assesses the quality of each \n1270\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nuniversity’s research and allocates future funding as one of the \nassessment criteria.   UK universities are now frantically chasing their non-academic collaborators for ev-\nidence that their research has been used in practice.   Moreover, in order to publish in top-quality peer-\nreviewed journals, academics have to produce models which push the boundaries of research knowledge. \nThese can take years to develop and are often highly complex.  Hospital managers however require mod-\nels \(by next week ncolleagues, and can be easily modified and updated without the need to call the modeler back to write \nmore code.  Business consultants of course have other objectives: it is not in their commercial interest to \nmake their models transparent, easy to use or let alone to teach hospitals how to modify them.  \n Another theory is the “not invented here syndrome”. While in some domains people are keen to adopt \nmodels and methods which have proved successful elsewhere, there seems to be a barrier in healthcare to \ndoing this. Healthcare modelers often hear the argument that a model which worked for Hospital X would \nnot work for Hospital Y because “our patients are different, our staff are different, our wards are differ-\nent, our systems are different….”  One wonders how true this really is. Do we really need 1,008 different \nmodels of Emergency Departments?  Surely all EDs have a great deal in common and have many broadly \nsimilar processes.  However in many healthcare modeling interventions, it is the process of stakeholder \nengagement, and not the end product, that is most effective \(Brailsford et al. 2007 just a vehicle for getting the right people together round a table and talking \nthrough the problem. So, and this is my “grand challenge”, is it necessary to go through this lengthy and \npainful process every time, or is it possible to develop a generic model, or a suite of generic building \nblocks, which can be used in plug-and-play mode to speed up the process? Gunal and Pidd \(2007 interconnecting models. However, I am not aware that this has been widely \nimplemented since then.  \n Bowers et al. \(2012 simulation model developed for an ED in Fife, Scotland; secondly, the re-use of this model \(with \nminor adaptation developed jointly by Lancaster University and the UK Department of Health \(Fletcher and \nWorthington, 2009 and intended to be freely available for use by any National Health Service hospital.  \nBowers et al. comment that “Where resources allow, the bespoke route can be attractive.” \(p1465 world, this would still be the method of choice.  The generic model had all sorts of \nissues with acceptance and Bowers et al. state that “There is a danger that even if it is technically valid, \nstaff may be reluctant to accept any intervention on the basis of a simulation that is perceived to repre-\nsent external practice p1465 p1465 stakeholder engagement, although there were still some issues with ac-\nceptance, and of course it was only re-used within the same hospital….   \n My challenge therefore is, is it possible to build a generic model, or a suite of generic building blocks, \nwhich are software-platform independent, and easily understood by clinical and managerial stakeholders \nin healthcare systems, and which would enable hospital simulations to be built rapidly and re-used, and \nwould lead to wide uptake and acceptance of simulation models?  Could 


simulation models ever be as \npervasive as spreadsheets in healthcare organizations?    \n3 STEPHEN CHICK VALUE OF INFORMATION AND DATA MODELING \nIn what is described here, I focus on some end-user benefits and possibilities enabled by trends in data \nand networking. Certainly, however, I won’t claim to be an expert in them all. Grand challenges by defi-\nnition require a contribution from a broad variety of experts. I have several somewhat disjointed observa-\ntions to make about the role of simulation in decision making. The observations are influenced by my \npath: which a couple decades ago included work in materials handling engineering in the automotive sec-\ntor doing discrete event simulation, to a transition to the faculty in industrial engineering with work on \nmanufacturing and on epidemic transmission systems, and to a decade ago to a business school.  \n1271\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \n Value of information If simulation is to be used in a decision making process, some specific benefit \nmust be derived. Decisions that are made on the basis of any decision support tool, including simulation, \nare often made in order to improve some metric. If we define benefits as an increase in such a metric, then \nthe development and use of a decision support tool can be considered to be an option to gain information \nthat reduces uncertainty about what decision is best. Quite a bit of work has focused on this from statisti-\ncal and from stochastic optimization perspectives, with various goals in mind. Bayesian, decision-\ntheoretic work takes the perspective that simulation sampling gives the option to learn about alternatives, \nthat sampling therefore reduces the risk of an incorrect selection \(in expectation opportunities in this line of work in several directions. One opportunity is that formal \nmechanisms to link more narrowly defined operational objectives to broader economic objectives \(with \npotentially risks that are not commonly modeled in simulations today economic impact of a decision taken with simulation? This means stepping \nback from operational details of a system being modeled and making the link to macro implications of \ndecisions \(does the increase in production rate actually improve the firm’s 5-year discounted NPV expected value of information approaches, which has \nseen ‘good’ results in a number of contexts, to very large scale problems \(combinatorial number of alter-\nnatives performance of alternatives and in random variate \nusage may be at play. This value of information thus raises a number of other interesting theoretical is-\nsues, involving sequential sampling and sequential decision making in environments with many decision \nvariables and complex correlation structures. The dynamic programming approach \(and related approxi-\nmations some interesting progress, but more re-\nmains to be done. This may prove useful not only in improving the speed at which complex simulated \nsystems can be optimized, but might also prove useful in terms of spill-over effects to sequential clinical \ntrial or health technology assessment applications. Another area worthy of exploration is a greater empha-\nsis of the role of risk of decisions \(from stochastic risks associated with random outcomes even when pa-\nrameters are known, from epistemic risks associated with uncertainty about what the parameters of a sys-\ntem are, and third from environmental risks associated with the fact that entire systems are changing \naround us risk, environmen-\ntal risk, I use to refer to scenario planning exercises that firms are increasingly using to characterize the \nmany shifts, often unpredictable, in environments. This third risk seems to offer opportunities to link sim-\nulation in the discrete sense to simulation in the business sense of developing monitoring and action plans \nassociated with industrial, economic and other structural uncertainties. That is can simulation be used to \nimprove ‘optimal’ system control in a non-stationary sense: the optimal control being a policy that adapts \ncontrol to events that arise. \n A very different benefit of the simulation modeling process is its use in getting people to share a \ncommon vision to a set of activities \(which will hopefully be organized into a process common vision and goal structure should not be underes-\ntimated when improving the functioning of effective processes. This so-called soft operations research has \nincredible practical value, and is by no means easy In addition to research within the field of simulation \nand operational research, scholars in the field of strategy \(strategy execution team alignment, etc problem. One ‘challenge’ is to extend the reach of current \ntheory across these domains to provide greater theory \(falsifiable hypotheses of the group decision making process or organizational alignment sort truly independently sampled. While a joint inde-\npendence assumption for stochastic outcomes may be a useful approximation to reality, there is often cor-\nrelation across activities in service or manufacturing systems a patient with a complicated operation is \nlikely to have complicated billing activities: service times in the 


operating room are likely correlated with \nservice times in administrative processes. Moreover, there may be correlations in time \(a tired worker \nmight have several service times that are slow in a row; a server with a long queue of customers might \n1272\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nwork faster across people. An example of autocorrelation across people is that infectious disease \noutcomes are correlated across individuals due to the nonlinear dynamics of disease transmission. These \ncorrelations can be shown to lead to very different conclusions for some important decision problems \n\(such as some in infectious disease control distributions is therefore important. Social network theory is in-\ncreasingly being applied to indicate that behavior may be correlated for other phenomenon besides dis-\nease transmission: such theory attempts to explain why outcomes also appear correlated in some non-\ncommunicable disease categories \(e.g., peer pressure in social networks about smoking; or behavior for \nactivity in groups that may reduce risks of obesity and related comorbidities world seems to be a worthwhile goal. This \ncould involve theoretical statistical models, estimation models and efficient variate generation tools. The \nagent based world has made some neat progress here, and there seems to be more that can be done. This is \nparticularly true with the open data movement and other massive data sets that can describe actual human \nbehavior. \n In summary, I think there are a number of interesting opportunities for simulation modelers in the ar-\neas of use of massive amounts of data, of development of theories with falsifiable hypothesis of human \ninteractions \(both in the decision making process and in the human interaction processes in simulated \nhuman systems management goals of the decisions be-\ning made with the use of simulation as a decision support tool. \n4 PIERRE L’ECUYER: STOCHASTIC MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION \nAvailable computing power to perform simulations increases relentlessly and fast, mostly due to the pos-\nsibilities for parallel and distributed simulation via cloud computing, multicore processors, and general \npurpose graphical processing units \(GPGPUs example. Larger and more complicated models can be \nsimulated, or more simulation runs can be performed to obtain tighter confidence intervals on certain un-\nknown quantities. But these results can be meaningless and misleading if the model is not sufficiently re-\nalistic and accurate. Simulation can be useful only to the extent that we can trust the model \(Law 2007 systems is one of the biggest challenges we face \nin modeling and simulation research. A key reason for this is that there are many sources of uncertainty, \nwhich are generally not independent, and the dependence is often very hard to model. In my experience, \nlousy and unconvincing stochastic modeling, often with lack of appropriate data given as an excuse, is \n\(unfortunately articles submitted to simulation journals.  \n In parallel with the increasing compute power, huge amounts of data are currently becoming available \nat a rate never seen before and that increases exponentially Exploiting this massive data to build credible \nand valid stochastic models of complex systems leads to statistical modeling and estimation problems re-\nlated to current research in Bayesian statistics, data mining, and machine learning, for example. Bayesian \nstatistics are involved when we need to effectively update the models as new data comes in. This is typi-\ncally needed when simulation is used periodically, in a dynamic fashion, to update decisions. In fact, \nMonte Carlo simulation methods are often used in these areas for parameter estimation and for “learning” \nthe models based on available data \(Robert and Casella 2004 is important to emphasize that realistic \nmodeling is generally much more complicated than selecting univariate distributions and estimating their \nparameters. Model inputs are often multivariate distributions and stochastic processes, with hard-to-model \n\(but important examples of large stochastic systems that are difficult to model. As a first example, \nconsider modeling and simulating the climate change on our planet, to study the potential regional im-\npacts. For this we need among other things N2O, freons, water vapor, for the air and water temperature, water cur-\nrents, surface ice and snow, the clouds, etc. This involves uncertainty which is difficult \(although essen-\ntial Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \n Such difficulties also occur for example if we want to simulate a whole human body or one of its \nparts, or the spread of infectious diseases by virus or bacteria in populations of humans, animals, and \nplants, with resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, or social networks and crowd behavior, where stochastic \nbehaviour of interacting humans is involved, or communication and transportation networks, which in-\nvolve various devices and stochastic demands and travel times, or stochastic models in finance, where ex-\nternal knowledge might be better exploited and where dependence between asset prices in a portfolio \(be-\nyond correlations 


health-care facilities \(clinics, hospitals, \nambulances, patient evolution ubiquitous. \n To examine a few concrete illustrations more closely, consider a telephone call center, where calls ar-\nrive one by one according to some stochastic process. Such centers currently employ around 3% of the nworkforce in North-America, so they are important economically \(Aksin, Armony, and Mehrotra 2007, \nKoole 2013 recovery, public services, emergency calls, taxis, fast food ordering, etc.  \n Important stochastic aspects to model in those centers include for example the call arrival processes, \nthe service time distributions, and the abandonments. Simplistic modeling often assumes that the arrivals \nare from a stationary Poisson process that the service times are i.i.d. exponential random variables, and \nthat patience times \(the time the customer is ready to wait for an agent before hanging up and abandon-\ning these assumptions are highly unrealistic.  \n Arrival rates in call centers are highly non-stationary; they depend on the time of the day, day of the \nweek, type of day \(holiday, special day, etc effects. The arrival rates are also highly \nstochastic. With deterministic time-varying rates, the number of arriving calls within any given time peri-\nod\(the arrival count variance equal to the mean, but the observed \nvariance of the counts over periods of a few hours is usually much larger than the mean, sometimes by \nfactors of over 50, and these counts are also dependent across periods \(Avramidis, Deslauriers, and \nL’Ecuyer 2004; Channouf and L’Ecuyer 2012; Ibrahim, L’Ecuyer, Régnard and Shen 2012; Oreshkin, \nL’Ecuyer, and Régnard 2013; Steckley, Henderson, and Mehrotra 2005 for this high dispersion, one may assume that the arrival rate is random, for example con-\nstant in each 30-minute time period, and with some dependence structure across time periods that could \nbe modeled via a copula. One difficulty in estimating such a model is that we do not observe these rates, \nbut only the arrival counts. This generally makes maximum likelihood parameter estimation much more \ndifficult. In fact, the available information is often only the arrivals count in each time period. Incoming \ncalls are also partitioned into different types, often several dozen types or more, where each type can only \nbe handled by a subset of the agents that have the corresponding skills, and the arrival processes are de-\npendent across call types \(Jaoua, L’Ecuyer, and Delorme 2013 dependence across periods and across call types simultaneously would give rise, in general, \nto highly-dimensional copulas that are very challenging to estimate.  \n Service time distributions \(call durations vary by up to a factor of 2 or 3 between two agents for the same \ncall type \(Gans, Liu, Mandelbaum, Shen, and Ye 2010; Ibrahim and L’Ecuyer 2013 handling, and may change with time \(due to learning effects, \nmotivation and mood of the agents, etc can be important factors to model and to consider when \nmaking work schedules for agents, but modeling them properly is not easy.  \n Similar arrival-process and service time modeling problems occur in other settings that involve hu-\nmans, such as customer arrivals at stores, incoming demands for a product, arrivals at hospital emergency, \netc. The uncertainty in those settings tends to be more important and more complicated than in industrial \nautomated systems that involve only machines. Modeling it in a trustable way is still a significant chal-\nlenge \(and is likely to remain so for many years ahead n1274\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \n5 CHARLES MACAL: AGENTS – THE FUTURE OF SIMULATION? \n5.1 Perspective \nTo frame our discussion, I’d like to ask: What is simulation? Because people often think of different \nthings when discussing simulation, Pritsker \(1979 compilation of defini-\ntions of simulation, and Oren \(2011 Based on the com-\nmonalities of these definitions, one could conclude that a simulation is a model of a dynamic process, i.e., \na process that is “animated” over time, and often, more recently, over space \(Law 2007 DES system dynamics \n\(SD ABS Carlo \(MC Rubinstein and Kroese, 2008 is what \n“simulationists” do -- or will be doing in the future. By simulationists I mean simulation scientists, engi-\nneers, or just regular people that develop or use computer simulation models. One way to look at a grand \nchallenge is to enumerate the things related to simulation that people are already spending or intending to \nspend, a lot of time and effort on, perhaps pointing out a few bottlenecks to progress and problems that \nmight require focused efforts of the simulation community in the future.  \n5.2 Grand Challenges nWith these arguments in place, we can ask equivalently, What is the future of simulation?, here focusing \non the OR/MS perspective, and What will simulationists be doing in the future? There is much discussion \nin the 


simulation community about all possible pair-wise combinations of the relationship among DES, \nSD, ABS, and MC simulation. Each approach carries its own community, including specialists, accepted \npractices, software, and common understandings of what constitutes good models and good applications. \nI propose the first grand challenge is for the simulation and modeling community to come to a common \nunderstanding of the various ways of how these simulation approaches fit together in applications to solve \nimportant problems of  national and global significance.  \nBut to my main point, I believe the future of simulation is agent-based simulation. In the future, simula-\ntionists will be building, using, and reporting results from agent-based simulations to decision and policy \nmakers; simulationists will team with scientists across many disciplines to build agent-based simulations \nand use them as electronic laboratories to advance scientific knowledge. In the future, all simulations will \nbe agent-based simulations, or agent-based simulations will be components of larger simulation systems. \nIn the course of developing many agent-based simulation applications, I have observed that it is not unu-\nsual in the current environment to be approached by potential collaborators customers, and clients who \nare interested in developing agent-based simulation. A common refrain is: “We do not know what agent-\nbased simulation is, … but we know we need it!” \(As to why people think they need agent-based simula-\ntion, and whether it is appropriate or not, is beyond the scope of the present discussion Macal and North, 2010 agents \nhave behaviors and states upon which their behaviors are based. An agent’s behavior, if truly dynamic nand giving an agent the capability to sense the environment, deliberate, and respond to interactions with nother agents, is based on the state of the agent at a particular time. An agent-based simulation consists of a \nset of agents, a set of agent interactions, and the mechanisms that update the agent states as a result of the \nagents’ behaviors and interactions. It is worth noting that agent-based simulation overflows the bounda-\nries of traditional simulation, and in my opinion ABS is a more general modeling technology. Agent in-\nteraction algorithms are the basis for decentralized system optimization algorithms, such as ant colony op-\ntimization and particle swarm optimization \(Barbati, Bruno and Genovese, 2011 areas I think are important for the future of agent-based simulation: behavior \(in-\ncluding connections to Big Data and Data Analytics Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \n5.2.1 Behavior \nOne of the reasons that people come to agent-based modeling is because they would like to include truer \nrepresentations of the behaviors of entities, or agents into their models \(e.g., Ferguson 2007 agent behavior matters at all, what micro-level \nagent behaviors would improve macro-level system performance and when collective behaviors may \nemerge among interacting agents, among other interesting research questions. Here, there is a connection \nbetween ABS and Big Data Analytics. For example, Kosinaki et al 2013 potentially akin to market segmentation and an antecedent to developing behavioral models updating agent states and blend-\ning that information with projections or forecasts of agent activities is another promising area \(Bengtsson \net al. 2011 and simulate all of society, \nwhich would have a variety of beneficial applications and uses \(Epstein and Axtell, 1996 of “psychohistory” that \nenables him to predict precisely the aggregate behaviors of large populations of people \(Asimov 1988 The Economist 2013 Parker and Epstein \n2011 occurs in ABS by the M&S communi-\nty. Emergence refers to the generation of order in the form of patterns and structures that self-organize \nendogenously within a model. ABS originated in the fields of study called complex adaptive systems and \nartificial life \(Macal 2009 natural systems are central con-\ncepts. People often come to ABS to study emergence by modeling “systems from the ground up,” mean-\ning that the agents and their interactions produce structures and patterns that they have not intentionally \nprogrammed into their models. For example, in the famous “Boids” model \(Reynolds 1987 each other’s \nspeed and direction. Most people find it surprising that for certain parameter settings related to the \nstrength of agent interactions, such agents form coherent swarms, reminiscent of fish schooling or birds \nflocking, that had not been explicitly programmed in to the model. Most agent-based models exhibit some nform of emergence whether it is recognized or not by the modelers. A grand challenge is to develop \nmethods that recognize endogenous emergent effects in models, create higher-level structures of the kind \nthat would 


emerge in real-world processes, and have those structure endogenously interact with agents.  \n5.2.3 Design nAgent-based models often just happen – they are not the result of a deliberate design process -- but they nshould be and will be in the future. Agent-based modeling should become more and more of an exercise \nin assembling pre-designed \(and potentially validated nEnormous progress has been made in the computer science community, for example, in object-oriented \ndesign where the objective of reusability has resulted in the efficient development of programs consisting \nof millions of lines of highly reliable computer code. In the agent-based realm, specifications such as the \nODD Overview, Design concepts, and Details design \(Grimm et al. 2006 implementation. In other words, the model design is a standalone entity, and implementation \ncan proceed in any computer language according to the unambiguous design specification.  Conceptually, \nevery decision made in the design process can be encapsulated and preserved for future use by others \n\(North and Macal 2013 n1276\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \n5.2.4 Micro to Macro \nAnother reason that people come to agent-based simulation is the challenge of connecting the micro \n\(agent behaviors population and system-wide behaviors behaviors, which may not be present in other types of simulations. Ana-\nlytic treatments of the micro-to-macro connections have so far been unavailable, but there may be room \nfor progress, either analytically or computationally. Related to this situation, is the need for breakthrough \ndevelopments for the proper treatment of uncertainty in simulation models, specifically methods that re-\nlated model inputs, data, and parameters to a scientifically valid characterization of model outputs. Char-\nacterizing uncertainty of simulation model outputs that correctly characterizes the uncertainties surround-\ning simulation input data as well as structural uncertainties in the model, such as those stemming from the \nuncertainties around behavior representations, are grand challenges. One approach to this may be to de-\nvelop equivalent classes of more aggregate and less computationally demanding meta-models that mimic \nlarge-scale stochastic models within estimated uncertainty bounds. \n5.3 CONCLUSION \nThe grand challenges above are among many challenges for agent-based simulation in the future. Other \ngrand challenges such as agent-based simulation validation, with the need to validate embedded behavior-\nal models as well as emergent processes, will ensure there is much exciting work to do in simulation for \nmany decades to come.  \n6 BARRY L. NELSON: SIMULATION ANALYTICS \nAs a simulation research and practice community we need to rethink the reporting of simulation results, \nor perhaps the tools we give users to create their own reports. At first blush this may seem like less than a \n“grand challenge,” but I am firmly convinced of two things: \(1 misunderstand the results they are getting now; and \(2 harmless. The most straightforward evidence for \(1 then they would almost certainly be asking for more, and as far as I can tell they are not. \nI will say more about \(2 capable of analyzing, \ndesigning, evaluating or controlling the large-scale, complex, uncertain systems in which we are interest-\ned. The available software is up to the model-building task, and the use of animation can inspire confi-\ndence that, say, an integer nonlinear programming formulation never will. However, the success of data \nanalytics in providing fine-grained, effective and profitable prescriptions based on transactional data is \ngoing to put increasing pressure on all mathematical models, including stochastic simulation, to do the \nsame. It is not a stretch to describe what we do as “data analytics on conceptual systems,” that is, systems \nfor which no actual data yet exists. Why should simulation be held to a lesser standard? We have proba-\nbly been able to slide by mostly reporting means and confidence intervals because until now, no one ex-\npected the real-world implementation to behave exactly as the simulation predicts, and even badly inter-\npreted simulation results nudged users toward better choices. That may no longer cut it. \n I want to be clear that I am not beating up on the software vendors. The research community has not \nmade a strong enough case for why this matters, nor have we provided very many good solutions. In this \nsection I will identify a few of the challenges we should address.  \n Here is the briefest possible summary of inferential statistics, and probably what we should assume as \nthe starting point for many simulation users You have a data set nyyy ,,, 21 … on some variable quantity \nY  and your goal is to estimate one or more properties of Y . In the simulation context Y is a system per-\nformance output and nyyy ,,, 21 … are simulation-generated observations of it. The long-run average and \npercentage chance something happens are familiar properties. To provide a concrete context I will refer to \n1277\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer Macal and Nelson \n \nthis real-world example: Prior to the U.S. elections of 2012 there was concern about 


whether the design \nand staffing of polling places would allow everyone to exercise their right to vote with tolerable waiting. \nHistorical voting patterns including numbers of voters by precinct, actual voter turnout and the percent-\nage of the vote cast by time of day were available, as well as ballot-dependent models of the time to cast a \nvote. Simulations were constructed to assess poll performance for any given staffing level equipment ca-\npacity or registration policies.  \n Here are some reasons why reporting the results of stochastic simulation experiments is not easy: \n Simulations generate a lot of data: Even this simple example generates delay data for each of hun-\ndreds to thousands of voters; congestion data for the polling place, the registration desk and the voting \ndevices; and utilization data for poll workers and voting devices. A complex manufacturing or supply \nchain simulation could easily increase the amount of data by one to two orders of magnitude. The im-\nmense volume of data is one reason that simulation software invariably provides summary reports, typi-\ncally averaging everything in sight; but averaging introduces its own problems. \n Averaging through time masks time-dependent effects: A critical feature of voting is time-varying \nload. In some precincts voting primarily takes place before or after working hours; but a precinct serving \na retirement community will experience a very different distribution of load. The delay experienced by \nvoters, averaged throughout the voting day, will hide the long delays experienced by some voters during \npeak load periods by averaging them with brief delays for voters off-peak. While averaging across repli-\ncations is always statistically helpful, averaging within replications may be bad. \n The performance that interests us is often related to time: Recall our generic output da-\nta nyyy ,,, 21 … . These might be voter waiting times during the simulated day. To be very specific, in a \ntypical simulation these could be the waiting times of n  voters in the order that they completed waiting. \nNotice first that the index is not the order of arrival to the polling place, nor the order of departure from it. \nBut even if the output data were sorted in one of these two ways, it is unlikely that we are interested in, \nsay 32y , the waiting time of the 32\nnd voter of the day to arrive. Instead, the anticipated waiting time as a \nfunction of the time of arrival is what is relevant For instance, what delay might a voter expect who ar-\nrives at noon as opposed to 5 PM?  I am willing to argue that for nearly all systems with time-varying \nload, measures of delay should be indexed by time. But this a more subtle measure to define and estimate. \n A related problem is reporting results for continuous-time outputs, like queue length tQ . These out-\nputs are naturally indexed by time, so it is easy to generate a within-replication time plot of tQ  vs. t  as \nnearly all simulation languages do. Averaging such data across replications to get a better estimate of \nmean queue length as a function of time is certainly meaningful, but how do you do it? The most straight-\nforward way requires saving lots of data from each replication \(the values of itQ and it  at each point in \ntime it  when it changed amount of post-run computation. If a measure of varia-\nbility around this mean queue length is reported, as it should be, then there is even more work. Yet this is \nexactly the sort of information that would be meaningful in the voting model. \n Simulations are conducted in a sequential, exploratory manner: In classical design of experi-\nments, important factors are identified, levels of the factors are chosen, and all of these predefined exper-\niments are executed and the results analyzed. However, since simulations are not physical experiments ndata \(“runs to conduct some simulation studies in a more exploratory fashion. In the voting simulation we might \npick a particular layout and staff, make a few runs, look for problems, and adjust the staffing and capacity \nwhere we see congestion or idleness. How do we summarize a user-guided sequence of experiments on \ndifferent scenarios so as to insure that they did not miss something or get mislead? \n We focus on reporting error instead of risk: We have a historical focus on measures of error while \ndecisions should usually be based on measures of risk; even worse, users often confuse error with risk. A \nconfidence interval \(CI error; measures of error answer the question “have we done \n1278\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nenough simulation to estimate whatever?” The answer should be related to the specific context like “I am \ncomfortable being off by ±$1000, but not ±$50,000.” The width of a CI says nothing about the natural \nsystem variability; that is, it says nothing about risk, although many people think that it does. A prediction \ninterval \(PI see when \nwe implement?” Measures of risk should be standard, but they are not. And when reporting either type of \nmeasure we should avoid statistically meaningless precision. See Nelson \(2008 2009 and Wieland and Nelson \(2009 and competing scenarios: It is a rare simulation that pro-\nduces only a single output measure, and for each output there may be more than one property we care \nabout. Trade-offs between costs, quality of service physical space, etc. are common. For some perfor-\nmance measures, the mean \(long-run average 


stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
