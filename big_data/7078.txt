Apriori algorithm is typical Boolean algorithm for mining association rules, which uses the method of iteration to create high-dimensional frequent item sets through low-dimensional ones. This paper introduces the 
design methods and technology realization of association rule mining by Apriori algorithm in technical action of ball games after a simple description of ball scripting language design method. Then take the association rule mining on table tennis technical and tactical analysis system as an example  That gives the further evidence of the effe ctiveness of Apriori algorithm  And  resolve the problem of association rule mining on technical movement of ball games Keywords-Data mining; Association rules; Apriori algorithm Technical action analysis  I  
 I NTRODUCTION   Ball game is an important component part in the field of competitive sports. The field of competitive sports has accumulated a large amount of data. At present, The analysis on these data uses statistical methods. Sports statistics mainly use the statistical principles and methods 1 The disadvantage of statistical methods is random sampling. It will lost useful information, and do not have good results for dealing with large amounts of data. In addition, most of the statistical analysis techniques are on the basis of perfect mathematical theory and lofty technique so it requires high performance for users 2 Analyze the data in the area of competitive sports by using Data Mining 
technique ,discover the important information easily be overlooked and help coaches make the right judgments have became a new challenge on the road of sports information One main feature of ball games is the relationship of technical movements. So association rule mining has became an important part of analysis of ball games. At present, ball association rules mining are mainly focused on application of Apriori Algorithm According to the concept of support, it analyses the correlate of actions users specify but has not formed a wide range of association rule mining This paper adopts Apriori algor ithm to analyze match data on the basis of information collection of ball games resolves the problem of association rule mining on technical movements of ball games, and achieves the purpose of 
assisting coaches with decision-making II  SCRIPTING  COLLECTION  METHOD  OF  BALL  GAMES Balls mentioned in this paper include volleyball, table tennis and basketball. In this paper, association rule mining is on the basis of data collection of ball games, so the description and collection me thods of ball scripting language must be designed. The common feature of ball scripting description language is that the language must can descript the process of games, so the collection method of ball games is based on process. That requires designing a variety of ball scripting language according to the characteristics of technical movement and games Ball scripting description language is defined in the 
analysis system. The collection technique is based on technical movements coding, which collect the technical movements athletes actually use into computer, according to technical movement encoding rules. Coding uses the form of four yards, and is separated by dots. Below take the table tennis as an example to illustrate the design method of scripting description language and the design method of scripting collection. The scripting language definition of table tennis and basketball, and scripting collection adopt similar design approach. This paper does not elaborate on that The scripting coding rule of table tennis includes hitting approaches, hitting effects, technical movements and where the ball is, among which, hitting approaches are classified into fifteen kinds, that is active forehand oblique line\(Z

According to the above codi ng rule, a round of table tennis competition  active forehand oblique line downward swirling near net 16 active backhand oblique line chop far away from table 61 active backhand oblique line loop drive far away from table 12 active backhand oblique line block down the net 20 score  can be described as  zx16.fc61.fh12.fd20  III  DESIGN  OF  APPRIORI  ALGORITHM  IN  ANALYSE  OF  BALL  TECHNICAL  MOVEMENTS Apriori algorithm is a basic algorithm to find frequent item sets 3 In acquisition and analysis system of ball games collect match data according to the collection method of scripting language. In the database, a round of the competition is stored as a record. The design goal of Apriori is to form an association rule mining middleware. Thorough iteration, it searches out all frequent item sets of the transaction database to lay the foundation for generating association rules  A  Design of Transaction Database Table Transaction data sets is th e direct data source of association rule mining 4 Boolean association rule mining is based on transaction database. Transaction table is generated on the basis of processing the data in relational database of ball games. The relational database of ball games includes match information table and scripting information table. They build relationships through match number. Transaction table take technical movements of table tennis as fields Data processing mainly uses the method of separation Separate the scripting records by dots, subtract zones, just leave match actions ,gain and loss mark. Then extract all actions of the member to be analyzed. In accordance with considerations of boolean asso ciation rules, assign 1 on the corresponding action code field position of the transaction table B  Algorithm Design Agrawal firstly proposed the association rule mining problem among item sets of custom transaction database in 1993 5 Apriori algorithm finds all frequent item sets of transaction database through recursion.Firstly,generate frequent 1-item sets L 1 then generate frequent 2-item sets L 2 until there is some value ,which makes L is empty algorithm stops. In the k iteratio n, firstly generate candidate k-item set C k the scan database to calculate the support count of every item set, reserve the item sets to form frequent k-item sets. Their suppor t is greater than or equal to the minimum degree of support. In which, C k need two steps to generate 1 joining. Every item set is generated by joining two item sets of L k-1 The two item sets must meet the following requirements. Their previous k-2\ms are the same, and the \(k-1\m is different from each other 2 pruning. Any non-empty subset of a frequent item sets is frequent item sets, so after joining, it need delete the frequent item sets, which have non-frequent subset. That is pruning 6  The pseudocode 7 of Apriori algorithm is as follows L 1 find_frequent_1-itemsets\(D  for\(k=2 L k-1 k C k  apriori_gen L k-1 min_sup  for each transaction t D{//scan D for counts C t subset\(C k t  for each candidate c C t  c. count   L k c C k c. count min_sup  return L k L k  prodedure apriori _ gen L k-1 frequent\(k-1\- itemsets min_sup : minimu  m support threshold for each itemset l 1 L k-1  for each itemset l 2 L k-1 if\(l 1 1]=l 2 1 l 1 2]=l 2 2   l 1 k-2 2 k2 l 1 k-1 2 k-1 en   c=l 1 l 2 join step:generate candidates if has_infrequent_subset c,L k-1 en delete c else add c to C k   return C k  procedure has_infrequent_subset c:candidate k-itemset L k-1 frequent\(k-1\itemset for each \(k-1\subset s of c if s L k-1 then return TRUE return FALSE IV  CASE ANALYSIS  In this paper, Apriori algorithm middleware has been applied in the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system, and achieved good result. It gives the maximum support for the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system A  Data Preprocessing This paper chooses three games of Wang Hao, china table tennis team members as analysis object of mining association rules. Extract match code from table tennis relational database. The data format is zx16 fc61. fh12 fd20 That is the description of a round of competition Now, separate the code, the se paration steps are as follows 1 Firstly, separate the code, subtract zones, just leave math actions , gain and loss score. Separate the above code then get the action ZX,FC,FH and FD 2 Check out whether the member to be analyzed is serving side. If he is, extract his actions from the first action and then extract interval action until the record is end. If he is not, extract his actions from the second action, then extract interval action until the record is end 3 After separating, assign 1 on the corresponding action code field position of the transaction table

B  Mining Frequent Item Sets In order to find high confidence association rules in a large range, we set lower minimum support threshold Suppose the minimum support threshold is 1%,minmum confidence level threshold is 40%.This paper mines association rules among three games of Wang Hao, a total of 352 valid data by using Apriori algorithm middleware. In order to unify abbreviations, code gain score as GO and loss score as LO. The specific process is as follows 1 Read record data into vector container 2 Count every word in the vector container, and store the word and its number into another vector container 3 Every word is a member of candidate 1-item set C 1 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 1-item set,and be sotred into frequent 1-item sets vector container.The process of generating frequent 1-item sets is as figure 2.Because the candidate item sets and frequent item sets are large enough,this paper can not enumerate 4 Join L 1 L 1 L 1 and generate candidate 2-item sets C 2 Count every word of C 2 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 2-item set,and be sotred into frequent 2item sets vector container 5 Join L 2 L 2 L 2 and generate candidate 3-item sets C 3  Count every word of C 3 If the word  s support count is greater than or equal to the minmum support count,it can become frequent 3-item set,and be sotred into frequent 3item sets vector container 6 Join L 3 and generate candidate 4-item sets C 4 C 4 is null. End Figure 2.Generate frequent 1-item sets by candidate 1-item sets C  Generate Association Rules The association rules of transaction database is to find the relationship among item sets 8 Strong association rules meet the minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold. Find frequent item sets from database D, then generate strong association rules.The process is as follows 2  1 For every frequent item set l, generate its all nonempty subsets 2 For a non-empty subset s of l, if  conf s count port l count port min_   _ sup   _ sup put out the rules  s=>\(ls   In which, min_conf is minimum confidence threshold Figure 3 is the association rule mining result  Figure 3.Association rule mining result D  Result Analysis Analyze the association rule mining results of math data of Wang Hao,we can get that his forehand and backhand are both skilled.His main score point is attacking ball  in combination with loop drive and fast band  Coaches should be thinking about is that how to combine with fast band loop drive ,attacking ball to in crease the probability score Wang Hao  s main losing score point is defense. How to reduce defense losing score is also an important problem But in the mining results, there are still unreasonable association rules. That is unavoidable. However, how to delete the unreasonable associa tion rules to increase the correctness of mining results is to be resolved V  CONCLUSION In this paper, the solution and realization scheme for association rule mining on analysis system of ball matches by Apriori algorithm is proposed. A Apriori algorithm middleware is realized, and it has been verified in the table tennis technical and tactical analysis system, achieved the expected purpose. The associa tion rule analysis is more universal than that between specified actions. Coaches can observe association rules to find hidden information. But how to increase the correctness of mining results is to be resolved. At present, in order to find a suitable threshold to analyze the association rules, coaches can only set different levels of support threshold and confidence threshold to observe the changes in association rules R EFERENCES  1  Quan Deqing,Cheng Zhiping.Statistics Disciplines of Sports and Development Trend[J J o u r n al o f XI A N P h y s ical E d uc at io n  University.2008.25\(1

   RMQ  j j v v propagate counters Figure 3 Determining the C counters Node v 004 represents the longest common preÞx of two sufÞxes from the same string j so C  v 004  has to be increased by 1 in the order they appear in SA  then the number of times that 003 is a pre\036x of the lcp of consecutive suf\036xes in that order gives C  003 D 1   With Lemma 1 this gives us all the tools we need to calculate the C counters on the 037y while visiting all branching substrings see also Fig 3 remember the position of the previous suf\036x of string j before position i for each j 002 1  d  in an array P 1 d  i.e P  j  m a x  p 003 i  D  p  j   Then when at position i 1  calculate the desired lcp as l  LCP  RMQ LCP  P  D  i 1  1 i 1  and increment by 1 the C counter of the node v 004 on R that has string-depth exactly l  Note that such a node must be on R  as it is on the path from SA  i 1 to the root The easiestwayto\036nd v 004 in R is to use another array of size n  Like with the S counters when popping a node from R  we need to add the C counters to its parent node This step takes care of the fact that the RMQs from the above paragraph just locate the longest duplicates but all pre\036xes of duplicates are duplicates as well 3.3 Determining Interesting Patterns In total the integration of the above two techniques implies that when a node v is popped from the stack the frequency of the respective substring is given by freq  S  C  From this we check if the string passes the frequency-based predicate e.g if it is an emerging substring If so we output T SA  i  d  1 for all values d between the string-depth of v inclusive and that of its parent-node exclusive 4 Space-EfÞcient Version The problem with the algorithm from the previous paragraph is that it still needs O  n log n  bits of space in the worst case even if we take compressed representations of suf\036xand lcp-arrays This is because for degenerated suf\036x trees the rightmost path could contain O  n  nodes from the suf\036x tree hence the space for stack R and all the counters would be O  n log n  bits We show in this section how to achieve O  n log  002   d log n  bits of space 4.1 New Data Structures We now step through the data structures from  3and show how to reduce the space for each of these 4.1.1 Representing D and P We use array P as is but we will represent array D implicitly Array P occupies d log n bits During the algorithm one needs to inquery P  D  i 1  when inserting the  i 1 th suf\036x array element after which one needs to update P  D  i 1   i 1 Value D  i 1 can be computed in time O  t SA  as follows Store a bit-vector B that marks the boundaries of documents in the concatenation T by setting B  j  1 if position j starts a new document in T  otherwise B  j  0  Preprocess B for rank queries where rank  B j  gives the number of bits set in B 1 j  That is rank  B j  gives the document number in which the j th position in T belongs to It is possible attach to B an auxiliary structure of size o  n  bits so that rank  B j  can be answered in constant time for any j 1  N o w w e h a ve D  i 1  rank  B SA  i 1   Using compressed suf\036x array the computation of SA  i 1 takes time O  t SA  and the rank query on B takes constant time The space used in addition to the already used compressed suf\036x array is n  o  n  bits for the bit-vector B and its rank structure 4.1.2 Representing R Stack R needs more functionality than being accessed only from top as in order to increase the correct C counter as described in  3.2 we need to quickly 036nd the node on R with string-depth l  LCP  RMQ LCP  P  D  i 1  1 i 1  Thus storing R as a difference-encoded list in O  n  bits 16 w oul d r es ul t i n h a v i n g t o s can R in O  n  time in the worst case after each RMQ Instead we represent R via a dynamic succinct data structure for searchable partial sums  This is a data structure maintaining a sequence of symbols A  a 1 a m  supporting the following operations  sum  A i   returns 002 j 005 i a j  search  A j   returns the smallest i such that sum  A i  012 j  update  A i 003  adds 003 to a i  003 O polylog n    insert  A i x  inserts x between a i and a i 1

 delete  A i   deletes a i It has been shown in 25 t hat each of thes e operations can be supported in O log n  time by using an extension of the data structure from  T he s p ace occupi ed by t h i s dat a structure is only n  o  n  O  m  O  n  bits provided that the sum of the numbers in A is always 003 n  In our case if the elements in A represent the number of letters on the incoming edges of the nodes on R and 0 for the root of the suf\036x tree then the condition 002 m i 1 a i 003 n is naturally satis\036ed because the longest suf\036x has length n  A query sum  A i  gives the string-depth of the internal nodes needed for popping all nodes with a string-depth 012 LCP  i 1  The index on R  of the node with string-depth l can be found by r  search  A l   Note that we do not need the full functionality of the dynamic searchable partial sum structure as the function update  is not used at all and we only have to insert and delete at the end of the sequence corresponding to pushes and pops on R  4.1.3 Representing C counters The C counters for counting the duplicates in a string are also stored in a searchable partial sum data structure see the previous section This time we only need the functions insert when a new node is pushed on the stack delete when a node is popped and update  A i 003 with 003=1 when updating a r after an RMQ or with 003 being the C value of the node that has just been popped from the stack This structure needs again n  o  n  O  m  O  n  bits if we can assure that that the sum of all C counters on the stack is always less than n  But this is true as a C counter of u is added to its parent node if and only if u s subtree has been traversed completely So each suf\036x can contribute at most1tothesetofall C counters hence the bound on their sum 4.1.4 Representing S counters The S counters for counting the total number of occurrences of a string are easier to handle as they only need to be accessed from top of the stack The only property we need to know is that the sum of the S counters is never greater than n  as they cover disjoint sub-arrays in SA  Thus we can encode them with variable-length pre\036x codes e.g Elias\010 code 11  T his t ak es again n  o  n  O  m  O  n  bits while supporting deletions and insertions at the ends in O 1 time 4.2 Space and Time Analysis The Compressed Suf\036x Array takes O  n  H 0  log log  002   bits of space Compressed LCP and RMQ values take overall 4 n  o  n  bits of space The database occupies n log  002  bits Array P takes d log n bits Bit-vector B and its rank structure take n  o  n  bits Interesting points are the peak space consumption of the data structures we use and their construction time The Compressed Suf\036x Array can be constructed using O  n log  002   bits of space in O  n log log  002   time 17  or even within space of the 036nal structure 23 b u t u sing O  n log n  time Once the Compressed Suf\036x Array is given the lcp-representation can be constructed in O  n log 004 n  time using no extra space in addition to the 036nal structure 16  T hen gi v e n t he C o mpres s e d S uf 036 x A rray and the compressed lcp-repres entation the linear time algorithm to construct the RMQ structure 12 tak e s O  n log 004 n  time using no extra space During the main algorithm we also allocate space for R  C and S  This space is bounded by O  n  bits as analyzed earlier The algorithm makes O  n  queries and updates to the data structures The most costly operations are the searches on R and updates on C which both take O log n  time Theorem 1 There is an algorithm for determining all F strings satisfying a frequency-based predicate in O  n log  002   d log n  bit of space and O  n log n  time Writing the output takes additional O   F  log 004 n  006 F 006  time where 0 007 003 1 affects the constant of the space usage and 006 F 006 is the total length of the output 5 Extensions and Applications 5.1 Less Space More Time Other tradeoffs are possible in Theorem 1 by using different variants of compressed suf\036x arrays It is possible to obtain nH k  o  n log  002   d log n bits of space with the running time increasing to O  n log n 1  log  002  log log n  Here k  o log  002  n  and H k is the orderk entropy of D  This is achieved by using the FM-index variant in 25 14  and building on top of it the additional structures needed for the full functionality of compressed suf\036x arrays as in 32  I n t hi s cas e t h e t e x t i s not requi red t o b e s t o red a t all after the construction as the structure is self-index and supports displaying any text substring of length 011 in O  011 log 1 006 n og  002   time That is outputting the result of the algorithm in Theorem 1 takes in this case O   F  log 1 006 n log  002   006 F 006

C  i  that we compute on-the-\037y in our algorithm His structure consists basically of the compressed suf\036x array and a unary coding of the frequency values in the inorder of the virtual suf\036x tree Sadakane shows that the 036nal structure occupies  CSA  2 n  o  n  bits where  CSA  is the size of the compressed suf\036x array used He does not give a space-ef\036cient construction algorithm a suf\036x tree is used as an intermediate stru cture hence taking O  n log n  bits We can construct the required unary coding during our algorithm as follows We maintain the balanced parentheses BP representation as in 32 u s i ng a dynami c b i t v ect or occupying n  o  n  bits This gives us the preorder of the virtual suf\036x tree nodes at each step We use another dynamic bit-vector to store the C counter values in the same unary coding as Sadakane uses Using rank and select  select  i  returns the position of the i th 1 19 on bot h bit-vectors gives us a mapping between BP bit-vector and the C counter bit-vector Inserting a new node in BP means inserting 1 in the corresponding place of the C counter bitvector Incrementing a C counter works by 036nding the corresponding node in BP mapping the position to C counter bit-vector and inserting 0 there Finally after all values are computed the preorder of C counter bit-vector can be turned into the inorder used i n Sadakanes scheme and the intermediate structures can be deleted The algorithm uses the same space and time as reported in Theorem 1 6 Experimental Results We have implemented the algorithm from  4inC 3 and compared it to the C++-implementation of the optimal algorithm from  3 Our implementation deviates from our theoretical proposal as we use a compressed suf\036x array that is based on sampling  We use a standard sampling rate of log n that minimize the space us age as this is the main objective of our approach However we will also see that a smaller 036xed sampling rate d rastically decreases the execution time while leading only to a moderate increase in space usage We present test results of time and maximum memory usage for different datasets of protein and genome data 6.1 Protein Datasets We used two datasets consisting of the primary structure of all protein data from human and mouse which were obtained from Swissprot using the keywords HUMAN and MOUSE in the NEWT taxonomy browser The human dataset  D 1  contained 71,622 proteins of total length 013 27.3MB and the mouse dataset  D 2  contained 62,562 3 The implementation can be downloaded from http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds proteins of total length 013 26.3MB It is interesting to compare these data sets because the genome of human and mouse is known to be largely the same but given the different phenotype of the two species must contain some signi\036cant differences All tests on protein data were run on a 3.0GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU with 3GB of main memory All output was redirected to the null-device in order to remove in\037uences from secondary storage units The programs were tested both on mining frequent substrings Probl 1 and emerging substrings Probl 2 The results for the frequent substring mining are reported in Tbl 1 Here the maximum support threshold 006 for D 2 was 036xed to  95  The more striking propert y of the space-ef\036cient algorithm is that it uses only 183.1MB of memory while the optimal algorithm needs 1,267.3MB This means a space reduction of a factor of 013 6  9  As already mentioned in the introduction space is often a more critical resource than time e.g users are often willing to wait 34 hours instead of 3 minutes if this allows them to apply their methods to much bigger data sets Table 1 Running time s seconds for mining frequent strings for the optimal   3 and the space-efÞcient   4 algorithm 005 is the minimum support threshold for D 1  The maximum support threshold 006 was held xed at  95  The last column denotes the size of the output 005 optimal space-ef\036cient  output  1 154.4 12,426 3,559 2 151.5 12,403 1,211 3 154.9 12,565 953 4 156.5 12,442 694 5 155.8 12,558 436 6 152.6 13,420 196 7 154.1 12,445 49 8 155.2 12,524 7 9 151.3 12,672 2 avg 154.0 12,606.1  The running times for the emerging substring tasks are reported in Tbl 2 for 005 g 1  3333  and Tbl 3 for 005 g  2  0  The results are largely along the lines of the frequent string mining tasks space is reduced by a factor of 67 and the running time is increased by about two orders of magnitude To give an idea on how the dataset length affects computation time and space usage we tested mining frequent substrings from different size pre\036xes of the protein data Tests were run on dataset pre\036xes of total length 250MB and on the whole dataset of length 013 53.6MB Here the maxi

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
