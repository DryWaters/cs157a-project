systems do not include dedicated processes for covert channel detection. In this paper, we first propose mechanisms to detect common covert channels. Then, within a whole security system we propose an optimized order regarding the execution of the three major security processes: Firewall, Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\nd Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS\. It will be demonstrated that the proposed order would allow security systems to offer better processing performances

that can be exploited by a process to transfer information in a manner that violates the system security policy [4  S o m e  features of the TCP/IP protocols suite can be used to send covert messages as discussed in [1,4,6,7   Covert channels are an immense cause of security concern because they can be used to pass malicious messages Therefore, detecting these covert channels is an important issue that needs to be addressed This paper discusses mechanisms for detecting the most common covert channels that use the TCP/IP headers. The mechanisms have been implemented in a security system called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS 
A whole security system should integrate at least three security processes, namely a Firewall, IDS, and CCDS Therefore, a whole security system, that includes Firewall IDS, and CCDS, should select the order of the execution of these processes for each given class of packet. Otherwise, a single order may affect the performance of the whole security system, since it may be suitable for a particular class of packets but not for another This paper presents an optimized order regarding the execution of the three security processes based on the classification of the packets. It will be demonstrated that the proposed order would allow security systems to offer better 
processing performances II MECHANISMS FOR DETECTING COVERT CHANNELS It is generally admitted that covert channels can not be completely eliminated [3, 4  Al t h o ugh i t co ul d be app re ci ab l y  reduced by design and careful analyzes In this paper, we propose mechanisms for detecting the hidden channels that might used the following fields Type of Service, IP Identification, IP options\( Strict source routing, Loose source routing, IP Timestamp and Record route are options chosen to embed hidden information. \, TCP initial sequence number \(ISN\, Urgent pointer.. The proposed 
mechanisms exploit mainly the characteristics of these channels and their weak points in order to be able to detect them 
This field is rarely used, thus the use of this field would be suspicious when it is set to a non null value. We should also mention that the bits 6 and 7 in this field are specified to be set to 0 [5   S o to d e t ect  a n o n leg itim ate u s e  o f th is f i e l d  w e  should check the value of these fields 
A IP covert channels detection 1 Covert channels using the \215Type of Service\216 field 2 Covert channel using the \215IP identification\216 field 
The values of this field are generated randomly, by the TCP/IP stack. But for packets belonging to the same 
connection and the same flow, the \215IP identification\216 field is incremented by 1. Thus, the detection of this particular hidden channel could be made by saving packets of various connections, calculating the difference between the IP IDs values of consecutive packets of each connection and test if it is equal to 1 
3 Covert channels using the following IP options: \215Strict source routing\216, \215Loose source routing\216, \215Strict source routing\216 and \215Record route\216 
First of all, these IP options require contents of IP addresses. So to detect covert channels using the IP options, we

need to check the validity of the inserted IP addresses in the IP options In addition, the use of the \215Record route\216 option as covert channel could also be detected using another technique. That is for consecutive packets, normally their network path will not change. So we should find the same list of IP addresses in the 215Record route\216 option for consecutive packets 1

We propose four classes This channel exploits the ISN field. In this case of hidden channels, the 3 rd packet of the TCP three-way-handshake packets is ignored. Thus, a method to detect this type of covert channel consists into detecting any non accomplished TCP connection class\(P\e Proposed treatment a Treatment #1 : Fragmented packets 2 For each class of packet, a particular treatment is applied In fact, a treatment indicates the order of execution of the Firewall, IDS, and CCDS. Table 1 shows the order of the execution of the three processes for each class of packets TABLE I T HE PROPOSED ORDER OF EXECUTION OF THE THREE PROCESSES FOR EACH CLASS OF PACKETS Urgent Pointer 1 2 3 4 Flood attacks packets class Class C2_UDP Figure 1 Treatment of fragmented packets Filter packets based on filtering rules defined in the Firewall A The classification process B Treatments of packets The \215 is the class of ICMP flooding attacks Flood packets are packets that intend to generate DoS attacks, such as SYN, ICMP and UDP flooding attacks Since there are three types of packets, we may define three sub classes, namely Class C2_TCP Class of packets integrating IP options Class C2_ICMP Class C1 Class C2 Class C3 Class C4 Fragmented packets class is the class of UDP flooding attacks The IP options appear seldom in the IP headers Consequently, packets with IP options are usually consider very suspicious Fragmented packets have the bit MF set to 1, or set to 0 and the "offset" field has a non null value class\(P\= {C2_ TCP class\(P\= {C2_ UDP class\(P\= {C2_ ICMP Treatment #2 A system, using the described detection mechanisms in the two previous sub-sections A and B, has been implemented. The system is called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS III INTEGRATION OF FIREWALL IDS AND CCDS SYSTEMS Let\220s assume we have an advanced integrated security system \(ISS\hat includes a Firewall \(FW\n Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\d a Covert Channels Detection System \(CCDS\. The ISS system should be able to perform three main functionalities, namely is the class of TCP flooding attacks 216 field is interpreted only if the URG bit is set. Thus, if this bit is not set, the "Urgent Pointer" field would have null content. On the other hand, if the URG bit is not set and this urgent pointer field contains a non null value we could mention the detection of a covert channel option, we should check if the timestamps values are increasing or not 200 200 200 200 200 200 Timestamp Detect and stop attacks based on attack signature defined in the IDS class\(P\= {C2_ TCP, C4 class\(P\= {C2_ UDP, C4 class\(P\= {C2_ ICMP, C4 class\(P\= {C3 class\(P\= {C3, C4 Treatment #3 The values of the timestamps should increase from a jump to another. To detect a hidden channel exploiting the  Detect coverts channels using detection mechanisms defined in the CCDS In this paper, we propose an optimization mechanism that uses a classification process. The classification process allows the ISS system to decide about how the packet will be treated In fact, once a packet reaches the ISS system, first it will be classified, then depending on its class, the order of the execution of the three processes will be selected for the packet A number of modern attacks use the application layer headers and data in the packets. Advanced security devices require deep inspection capabilities, known as Deep Inspection DI\, to detect application layer attacks Fragmented packets Treatment #1

When a received packet then the Firewall is activated to filter it. The IDS and the CCDS will be activated next. Depending on the nature of the incoming attack packets, which is usually random, we will switch between the FW is the number of rejected packets by the  IDS If The average packet processing time  by the  IDS of an initial packet The average fragment processing time by the CCDS IDS order. Let\220s define the following 200 IDS The average packet processing time by the ISS without the classification process reception from  the fragment arrives before the CCDS finishes processing fragment j \(Figure 3 Thus, we can deduce the following formula     2 So we have  3 reception    212   Figure 2 Figure 2 The CCDS treatment of two successive fragments when xij 3 j  To compute x\220 i we distinguish two cases in n j ij j j i i x x x x is the number of rejected packets by the CCDS The CCDS finishes processing fragment j before the arrival of fragment When the ISS system uses our classification mechanism the processing time for a given fragmented initial packet can be stated as follow j  j x ij j  j x ij 0 001 200 212  1 Arrival Fragment  n CCDS P i 1 Proccessing time evaluation with the classification process i i i i z y x t j i i n j in ij j j i i i i i i z y x x x t z y x t then the CCDS will be activated before the IDS and vice-versa. Thus with this treatment our system will be a stateful  learning integrated FW, IDS, CCDS j j 1 1  0  max  Packets that belong to the {C2, C4} class, present at the same time two risks: a risk to cause a flooding attack \(C2 a risk to carry hidden information \(C4\ Since the CCDS needs only one or two packets to detect a hidden channel, but the IDS needs usually more than one packet to detect attacks, mainly DoS attacks. That\220s why we have chosen the FW The average packet processing time  by the FW t i x i y i z i x ij Fragment 1 st case: x ij 2 nd case: x ij  Packet processing time by the ISS \(t i processing time of all the fragments of the initial packet by the CCDS+ processing time of the reassembled packet \(initial packet\ by the FW processing time of the reassembled packet by the IDS j+1 A Treatment #1 The average packet processing time by the ISS with the classification process The average processing time needed by the CDS for all the fragments IDS order to treat such type of packets. In the case of packets that belong to the {C3, C4} or {C3} classes they have specificity since they include applicative headers which must be treated in deep by the IDS. In such a case, the IDS needs several packets to decide whether the packets carry attacks or not. That\220s why the CCDS will be executed just after the Firewall, for this type of packets IV PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section, we intend to evaluate the performance of an ISS system with and without our classification mechanism. The processing time of different types of malicious packets by the ISS system will be evaluated In order to evaluate the processing time, we define the following: For a packet n IDS The average packet processing time by the CCDS 001  fragments, we may define the following: For a fragment 1 1  0  max   CCDS waiting time for the 0 n CCDS n IDS n j i j  200 x ij  j+1 212  j+1  Fragment 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 j x ij j CCDS processing time for the fragment j Thus:      \(1 However, x\220 i f \(n, x ij     Each received fragmented packet will first pass through the CCDS to check if it carries hidden information. If it is the case the fragmented packet will be rejected and an automatic update will take place. That is, a rule, which will block all the fragmented packets that have the same IP ID as the rejected fragmented packet, will be added. If all the fragmented packets that belong to one original packet P do not encapsulate hidden data, the original packet P will be reassembled. Then, it will be sent to the Firewall. Thereafter, if it is not rejected by the Firewall, it will pass through the IDS \(Figure 1 b Treatment #2 : Flood attacks packets x\220 i j  212      a Treatment #3: Packets belonging to {C2, C4}, {C3 C4}, and {C3} classes t\220 i CCDS order and the FW fragment

Thus, we will have 7 001 transports hidden information, all the packet will be rejected.

So CCDS processing time for the fragment 001  With the classification process With the classification process 1 st case 2 nd case 001  However, the time that the CCDS needs to treat a fragment x ij ost equal to the time needed to treat the original packet \(x i This is due to the fact that the mechanisms implemented on the CCDS treat only the IP header and TCP header. Thus, treating a fragment or the original packet will take almost the same time In this case, we will have the following formula, when the ISS includes the classification process 11 However, when the ISS does not include the classification process, we will have With the classification process, if the fragments encapsulate a hidden channel, the CCDS will detect it, since in general With the classification process we have 13 CCDS processing time for the fragment j 212  Fragment Fragment j+1 Arrival 3 Case studies a   212  212  l l i i x x j Arrival i i i n j j i z y x t i i n j in ij j j i i z y x x x t i i n j in j i i i n j in ij j j i i i n j in ij j j i i z y x t z y x x x z y x x x t i i n j in ij j j i i z y x x x t x i  212     Thus, the classification process allows the ISS to offer almost the same performances as when no classification process is used 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1       If we consider the reassembling We consider the case of an inoffensive fragmented packet The processing time for this type of packet is    9 The processing time for this type of packet is    10 We agree that without the classification process, the ISS will have to wait until the initial packet is reassembled, before carrying out its treatment. Therefore, the average packet processing time \(t\220 i by the ISS can be as follows If the fragment 1 So       8 Thus, we will have 1 1  200 200 200 200 200 200 j x ij  002 fragment   1 1  0  max 1 1 1 1 1 1

On one hand, it is specific to packets encapsulating IP options, which are likely carrying hidden channels. On the other hand, this treatment is specific to packets integrating an applicative layer which is deeply inspected by the IDS Since max d d d d d d d z y t z x y t        V CONCLUSION In this paper, first we proposed mechanisms for detecting covert channels that use TCP/IP headers to hide information The mechanisms have been implemented in a security system called Covert Channel Detection System \(CCDS The processing of the packets by the three processes Firewall, IDS, and CCDS\ should be optimized. That\220s why we have proposed treatment mechanisms based on the classification of the received packets. The performance evaluation gave satisfactory results This work could be extended by proposing other mechanisms for detecting more types of covert channels [5   We could also extend this work by implementing a prototype system R EFERENCES 1 A hsan K a m r an 215 Co v e r t C h a nne l A n al y s is and D a t a H i d i ng  i n T CP  I P 216 Master Thesis, University of Toronto, 2002 2 B a ss T   215I n t ru si o n De t e ct i o n Sy st ems a n d  M u l t i se n so r Da t a F u si o n 216   Communications of the ACM, Vol. 43, No. 4, pp 99-105, April, 2000 3 B  W  L a m p s on 215A n o t e on th e c o n f i n em en t p r o b lem  216 in P r oc eed i n gs of the Communications of the ACM, number 16:10, pp. 613\205615 October 1973 4 C  H   R o w l a n d  215C over t ch an n e ls in th e TC P  I P p r ot oc ol s u i t e 216 Tec h  Rep. 5, First Monday, Peer Reviewed Journal on the Internet, July 1997 5 Chr i sto p h e r A b ad I P che cksum c o v e r t chan ne l s and se l e cte d h a s h  collision", Technical report, 2001 6 K am r an A h s a n a n d D e e p a K u nd ur   P r acti cal  da ta h i di ng i n T C P  I P    I n  Proceedings of the Workshop on Multimedia Security at ACM Multimedia, December 2002 7 M  W o lf 215C ov ert c h ann els i n L A N p r ot oc ols  216 in Proc eed in gs of t h e  Workshop on Local Area Network Security \(LANSEC\22089\, pp. 91 \205 102, 1989  R i c ha r d St even s 205 \215T C P  I P I l lu s t ra t e d  Volu m e 1 216 200 1   9 S te v e n J   M ur do c h S t e p he n L e w i s    E m be d di ng  Co v e r t Ch a nne l s i nto  TCP/IP", the 7th Information Hiding Workshop, Barcelona, Catalonia Spain\ 6 \205 8 June 2005 i i i x y t d z i x i t i t i i i in n j ij i z y x x t                CCDS ICMP packets carrying hidden information in the IP \215Timestamp\216 option  1  1 1 1 IDS For the IDS i i i i x z y t d i For IDS order.

It is capable of solving the challenging instance 21, 8\been solved by any other algorithm yet \(to the best of our knowledge\hows the results of PMS3. The table does not include the result for L less than 17. Although, PMS3 is an efficient algorithm, we had to implement it in such a way so that it is able to work for higher values of L and D. Thus, the algorithm does not perform better than the previous algorithms for the lower values of L L d Time 17 6 20,000 sec 18 6 12,000 sec 19 7 26 hrs 21 8 22 days Table1. Performance results for PMS3 Although, PMSP 3 which are also improvements over PMS1 perform better than PMS3 for \(17, 6\, they are still not able to solve the challenging instance \(21, 8\ MCL-WMR [4 shows g ood  results but it can\222t solve the challenging instance \(17, 6  For challenging instances, the list R generated in PMS3 is of the size nearly equal to 4 l\222 Thus, for such cases we actually check for all possible l\222 mers. This problem is solved in PMS3p by using the pruning technique. For the l 2 mers in Sequence 1, we generate all neighbors with a hamming distance less than or equal to d For challenging instances, this would be of the size 4 l2 The space complexity of this algorithm would be O \(mn\etically the time complexity of PMS3p would be same as PMS3. But, in practice there would be a significant improvement. We can claim this because PMSprune which is an improvement over PMSP, take only 69 minutes to solve 17, 6\ours taken by PMSP PMS3 takes about 5.5 hours to solve the same problem. So, if we implement PMS3p we expect the time taken to be less than an hour. It is noteworthy that MCL-WMR does not work for the challenging instances like 17, 6\It can solve the \(non-challenging instance \(18,6\gorithm proposed in this paper is much faster compared to it VI  CONCLUSION We have extended and implemented PMS3 which was initially proposed in  The algorithm uses a very simple concept Although it takes a little more time than PMSP and PMSprune [3 a p a b le of solving \(21, 8\e of the previous algorithms have been able to solve challenging instances for d 7. For instance our algorithm is better than the algorithm proposed in [4  The algorithm has scope for  improvements and in future we would be working on methods to reduce the time.  The new algorithm PMS3p proposed here has not been implemented yet, but we expect that it would be much faster than PMS3 and will also outperform PMSprune  VII  REFERENCES    S. Rajasekaran, S.

6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
