To achieve dynamic update, we have unique tables Customer Table–3 \(to identify the next two preferred products based on weights Evaluation Table \(for price weight evaluation Evaluation Table \(for quantity weight evaluation Table 5 Customer Table-3 E Customer Table-3 In this table \(Table 5 P1, P2, P3, etc. for the sake of simplicity \(example: P1 Milk, P2 - Beverage, P3 - Sauce, etc the next two preferred products based on the current picked product, we search the pervious purchase history, which will contain the total number of times a product P2, P3, etc. is picked after Product P1. Next_Pro1 stores the next preferred product which has the maximum weight \(i.e. the product which is picked the most number of times after the current product which has the second maximum weight \(i.e. the product which is picked the second most after the current product The value of Next_Pro1 and Next_Pro2 will be dynamically updated in the Customer Table-2 based on the values in the Customer Table-3 In order to calculate the weights for price and quantity for each product category we use price evaluation and quantity evaluation table Table 6 Price evaluation Table Price Evaluation table \(Table 6 each product categories’ price weights for all the customers The weights are calculated using the weighting function mentioned before. The price value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2 Table 7 Quantity evaluation Table Quantity evaluation table stores the information of each product categories’ quantity weights for all the customers The weights are calculated similar to the quantity evaluation technique and is increased or decreased based on the number of times that particular item is purchased or rejected. The quantity value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2 In summary, the system initially searches for the next preferred product based on the customer personal preferences and personal purchase history, if a match is not

found, then it search the database for other customers purchase history who fall under the same customer category of this customer. Still if there no matches are found, then we apply general association rules to identity the next preferred product. This is described in the following sub-section F Association Rules In a situation, when the system cannot find similar cases for the customer then the recommendation is done by using association rules.  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and correlation relationships among large sets of data items. Association rule mining is widely used in market based analysis. The data obtained can be used for cross selling, store layouts, etc. An association rule typically is of the form A 002 B where A is an item set and B is an item set that contains only a single atomic condition. According to  percentage of records containing item sets A and B together The confidence of a rule is the percentage of records containing item set A that also contain item set B”. Support here indicates the usefulness of the discovered rules and the confidence is the certainty of the detected association rule Table 8 Association Representation Transaction ID Products TS00001 Bread, Butter, Milk TS00002 Bread, Cheese, Eggs TS00003 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs TS00004 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs TS00005 Milk, Butter, Eggs, Yogurt TS00006 Bread, Cheese, Milk, Eggs Peanut Butter Association rule mining technique finds all collections of items in a database whose confidence and support meet or exceed pre-specified threshold values. For example, Table 8 shows the results of association mining on products that  apriori algorithm for the mining of association rules. The authors use actual sales data to test the feasibility of the algorithm. For our system we intend to extract the transaction information from the transaction table and feed the data into the modified apriori algorithm extract the association rules G Features of the Proposed System Figure 3 shows the summary flowchart of the proposed system 1. Detect the current product picked and display the next product that the customer wishes to purchase 2. Display the location \(aisle its price and quantity 3. Display warnings if the customer is allergic to certain products, based on the information provided by the customer on his/her profile and the product’s ingredient information Figure 3: Summary Flowchart Figure 4: Typical Display on the Cell phone As an example, Figure 4 shows that the first product picked by the customer is Bread, and the system suggests

two next preferred products \(Milk and Eggs decides to purchase the Milk. However, the customer decides to pick Rice, instead of the suggested Eggs. The system automatically identifies the next preferred product after Rice and gives the right suggestion at the same time it updates the database with this new case for future recommendations IV S YSTEM I MPLEMENTATION Figure 5 is the block diagram which explains the system architecture. There are three major components in the system. The RFID tagged consumer product, RFID reader enabled mobile device and the backend enterprise system The backend enterprise system consists of the Intelligent System and the Database.  In a regular scenario, the customer walks into the store with his RFID reader enabled cell phone; he picks a product from the aisle and scans it The RFID reader sends the tag information along with the consumer information to the backend enterprise system for processing. The Backend enterprise system which, consists of two parts i\: Applies the rule-based and case-based reasoning to identify the preferred product ii\atabase: Stores the user profile information and the case base \(previous purchase history processing Figure 5: Block Diagram of System Implementation An RFID reader can be embedded in the mobile device like cell phone, iPhone or blackberry. The data sent by the reader is modulated and backscattered from a number of tags. Passive RFID tags are cost effective and they harvest energy from the reader’s communication signal to power up their operation and communication with the reader. The RFID reader has the capability of reading several products within a few seconds. In a typical supermarket all the products are stored in clusters, if the customer takes the RFID reader enabled cell phone near the aisle, it might read most of the products in the aisle which are in close proximity. This might be a problem in our application because we would like the reader to read just the product picked by the customer in order to recommend the next preferred product. One way to overcome this limitation is to have the user to place the RFID reader enabled cell phone in the shopping cart and have the read range of the RFID reader limited to 10 to 15 cm. Then the customer can scan the product using the RFID enabled cell phone V C ONCLUSIONS We have proposed the design and implementation of an RFID-based system for use by consumer businesses in the retail industry. Our system is able to quickly suggest products to customers based on their preferences using rulebased and case-based reasoning We believe the proposed technique will be more effective if it is store specific, since each store has a unique set of products and unique placement of products in the aisles. Having a store specific approach will also help the business to manage and protect their customer purchase history. The proposed technique can be extended for applications like the library system, pharmaceuticals, air and rail ticket booking system, etc., where the customer will have regular and similar purchase behaviors. The intelligent system will be more effective if we have more customer purchase information, which will help us to clearly understand and get accurate weights for the behaviors. Since RFID technology is still in early implementation stages, we need to consider security issues and traffic congestion issues before implementing it. We would like to test the data to find the accuracy level in each metric like price, quantity and order choice. We are also looking for more hybrid techniques to identify similarity of the patterns in the longterm purchase behavior and short-term purchase behavior and also to identify any change in the purchase behavior based on seasons or other social aspects A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was part of a project on RFID Applications sponsored by Industry Canada.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
