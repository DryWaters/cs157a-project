 Stduy On An Improved Apriori Algorithm And Its Application In Supermarket  Lin Lu School of information and control engineering Xian university of architecture and technology Xian 710055, China Pei-qi Liu School of information and control engineering Xian university of architecture and technology Xian 710055, China   AbstractApriori algorithm is a classical mining algorithm uses the association rules. After analyzing the Apriori algorithm, this algorithm is inefficient due to it scans the database many times Based on the strategy of accessing to database once, a new improved algorithm founded on the Apriori is put forward in this paper. Experiments show that it can significantly improve computation efficiency, i.e. reduce the calculatin time and space This algorithm has been widely used for supermarkets in customer consumer knowledge mining Keywords-Apriori; Association rules; Frequent itemsets I. BASIC CONCEPTION With the practical application data increases sharply, many professionals are more and more interested in the knowledge about data mining[1], especially the association rule mining Association rules mining discovers interesting strong rules between affairs. Let I=\(i1, i2, . . . , in T1 T2, . . . , Tn DB min_sup and min_conf are minimum support-degree and minimum confidence-degree. For a given itemset A and transaction T, if: A?T, then T contains itemset A. A is a frequent itemset if P\(A A=X Y? ,if X?I,Y?I,X?Y=?,Support \(X?Y X?Y min_sup, Confidence \(X?Y X|Y is a strong association rule[2]. Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm mining association rule. It contains two steps Find all frequent itemsets by scanning DB Create strong association rules in the frequent itemsets Step one needs to scan DB many times, which takes a lot of 


time and space. As a result, what needs to be improved is the mining efficiency of frequent itemsets in DB II. ANALYSIS OF TRADITIONAL APRIORI ALGORITHM Apriori algorithm uses the iterative method of layer-bylayer search[3, 4], and k-itemset is used to explore for \(k +1 itemset. Firstly, compute all the candidate 1-itemset C1, find all the frequent 1-itemset L1; then confirm candidate 2-itemset C2 by L1, and find frequent 2-itemset L2. Repeat the processes until frequent k-item cant be found. Getting each Lk needs to scan DB once and it wastes a lot of  time In many cases, the candidate produce-check method of the Apriori algorithm reduces the size of candidate itemsets in a large extent and produces good performance. However, it will produce a great number of candidate sets while computing. It needs to scan DB many times although some pruning strategies are applied, which costs a lot of time. These are its major disadvantages [5]. So, we designs a new algorithm which scans database only Once and deals with data One by One\(OOO improve the performance of Apriori by reducing numbers of candidate sets and scanning times III. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF OOO ALGORITHM A. OOO algorithm design For traditional algorithm, if any subset of k-itemset x is unfrequent, x must be unfrequent, and if x is frequent, its subsets are also frequent. When producing candidate sets, if item ab in record i is a frequent set, its  the same to all records after i. However, with the items compared become fewer, the number of Ck\(k>1 a Ck needs scanning DB once. Scanning DB frequently influences the mining efficiency seriously, moreover, most information is discarded. So we can get and note all information after scanning to avoid repeated actions. Above properties of traditional algorithm are basic ideas for the new improved algorithm. 10 OOOs detail process is following S1: open DB, set i=1, candidate set C=?, frequent set L S2: if i>|DB|, go to S10 S3: set t=Ri, compute j=|t S4: if j=0, go to S9 S5: Cj={x|x?t?|x|=j}. If x?Cj?x?L, Cj=Cjx S6: C=C C? j?x. count=x. count+1 S7: if x?C?x. count=min_sup, L=L {y|y? ?x }?C=Cx S8: j=j-1, go to S4 


S9: i=i+1, go to S2 S10: close the database and produce association rules Ri is record i, and x. count is the support-degree of item x OOO only needs to scan the database once, and reduces the cost of accessing the database frequently. It wont produce the Natural Scientific Foundation of Provincial Department of Education Shaanxi \(No. : 08JK318 architecture and technology: "The research on uncertain reasoning mechanism of fuzzy concept map" \(No. : RC0618 441  candidate item whose support-degree is 0 and will reduce the number of candidate items. Besides, its time cost has almost noting to do with the level of frequent itemsets B.  Analysis of algorithm complexity 1 Apriori algorithms time complexity primarily represents the process of searching affair itemsets. When applying the bottom-up method, the complexity of accessing affair itemsets is:f\(k k O\(k3 k itemsets includes Produce k-items of candidate sets ?k i=1Ci and frequent sets ?k j=1Lj for the first item of R1. It only needs to scan the first item of data, scan times M1=1 Produce new round items of candidate sets. While scanning the second item of data R2, all of the old kitems of candidate sets and frequent sets should also be scanned, M2=1+|R1|?k i=1|Ci|+|R1|?k j=1|Lj Produce the third round items of candidate sets. M3=1 R2|?k i=1|Ci|+|R2|?k j=1|Lj Produce the last candidate sets, and get all Lk M|DB|=1+|Rj|?k i=1|Ci|+|Rj|?k j=1|Lj| by min_sup f\(k R1||R2|?+|Rj Ci|+|Li R1||R2|?+|Rj| is the sum of scanning j items of data record and every item of data record is scanned only once and j=|DB|1, then |R1||R2|?+|Rj|=|DB|-1 from the illation processes. So f\(k DB|-1 Ci|+|Li F\(k k k k 2 Apriori algorithm needs |DB| temporary variables to deposit database records every time produces a level of candidate sets

So N1=1+2 |R1|[?k i=1\(|Ci|+|Li Produce a new round items of candidate sets: still use t to deposit the current record R2, use |R2|[?k i=1\(|Ci|+|Li storage variables to deposit the candidate sets and frequent sets of the second item of data, use |R2|[?k i=1 Ci|+|Li degree of the candidate sets and frequent sets of the first item of data. N2=1+2|R2|[?k i=1\(|Ci|+|Li Produce the third round items of candidate sets N3=1+2|R3|[?k i=1\(|Ci|+|Li Produce the last candidate sets, and get all of the frequent itemsets Lk.

Besides, the more records read from the database, the less candidate items are product. So max\(?k j=1|Cj is far less than max\(? k i=1 |Ci k Cj Lj Ci|+|Li k As above, to traditional algorithm, OOO not only has fewer times of scanning DB and comparing, but also reduces the time and space complexity. It can significantly reduce the 


number of candidate items when DBs records and field values included in each record  are many IV. A SIMPLE INSTANCE Suppose there is a simple affair database includes 4 records abc, bce, abcd, be. Table 1 shows the detailed processes executed by OOO algorithm when min_sup is 50 TABLE I.  THE EXECUTION PROCESSES OF OOO ALGORITHM  V. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION Association rules mining is applicated widely in the supermarket DB. The policy-makers can not only take promotions to attract customers, but also to optimize the trade by finding the contact between customers and their trades. We have implemented the traditional algorithm and the OOO algorithm in dealing with a large amount of supermarket data and compared the time costs 442  The experiment data set test.csv is an excel table includes 10800 items of shopping data, whose basic items are bread milk, earthnut, egg, butter. 0 means having not been bought and 1 means having been bought. Table 2 shows a part of data TABLE II.

Its very clear that OOO shortens the implementation time, improves the treatment efficiency and has stronger stability 0 100

These rules are interesting. They have some guiding significance on improving the supermarkets sales levels, the capital turnover rate and the supermarkets management TABLE III.  STRONG ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  VI. SUMMARY This paper has studied the classic association rules mining algorithm and discussed shortcomings of the Apriori algorithm It has designed and implemented the OOO algorithm, and taken the supermarkets consumer knowledge mining for example to compare. OOO algorithm is more stable and efficient because it only needs to scan DB once, has no additional candidate items, and does not need pruning. Its advantages are especially apparent when the database record and the field values each record includes are many ACKNOWLEDGMENT First of all, Id like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Liu Peiqi, who has done a great favor to my thesis.

P1j implies that the preference of the goal customer and his/her neighbors across every product in a grain product j depends on the normalized value of total number of occurrences of click- through, basket placement and purchases. P1j is a 1n matrix. [27 Phase 8: Product Association Analysis In this phase, we first search for meaningful relationships or associations among grain product classes through mining association rules from the large transactions. In order to capture the customers shopping inclination more accurately, we look for association rules from three different transaction sets purchase transaction set, basket placement transaction set and click-through transaction set. This work results in building a model called product association model represented by a matrix. A product association matrix A = \(aij total number of grain product classes                otherwise jiif jiif jiif jiif a c b p ij 0 25.0 


5.0 1 1 Phase 9: In the 7th and 8th phases, we have built the customer and his/her neighbors preference model and the product association model. A personalized recommendation list for a specific customer is produced by scoring the degree of similarity between the associations of each grain product class and their preferences and by selecting the best scores. Cosine coefficient [7] is used to measure the similarity. The matching score sij between the same group customers and a grain product class j is computed as followings 57     n k kj n k ik n k kjik j i j i ij ap ap AP APS 1 2 1 2 1  [22, 13, 24 Where Pi is the row vector of the 1  n customer 


preference matrix, and Aj is the j- th column vector of the n  n product association matrix A. Here, n refers the total number of grain product classes. The sij value ranges from 0 to 1, where more similar vector results in bigger value. [22], [24 Phase 10: The 9th phase implies the higher preference of grain product classes for group of the goal costumer. Hence, in that case, we have to choose which products in this grain product class have the highest reference frequency and recommend them to the costumer A. Detection of the results of execution of this method in a sample department store To determine the ability of the INORM method it was necessary to find a database of a department store The costumer's shopping detailed list of the Ghazal department store in 2005 was entered the software designed based on the INORM method, negotiating with that store, there were 41 costumers with different reference frequencies and different shopping Costumers were from different ranges of long time and short time background with deference frequencies of high and low and also high and low money spending capacities and etc. In this database there are 108 different goods and based on the requests these goods are categorized in 21 different categories. The store manager was also asked to form the association matrix of goods, according to her experiences Regarding the market and costumer's condition, the store manager determines the wRFM and wP coefficients and considers them as 0.5. She is also asked to determine the wR, wF and wM, coefficients which are considered as 2, 3 and 3 in order they are named above. [5 B. Experimental metrics Two metrics, precision and recall, are commonly used to measure the quality of recommendation.

itemsdrecommendecorrectlyofnumberecision  Pr An F1-metric can be used to balance the trade-off between precision and recall F1-metric assigns equal weight to precision and recall and is given by precisionrecall precisionrecallF uu 21   [24 Notably, each metric is computed for each customer and the average value computed for each cluster, as well as the overall average \(over all customers taken as measures of the quality of the recommendation. [17], [13],[5 C. Experimental results With mentioned preparations, 3 manners are considered for execution in which the recommendations are calculated in collaborating filtering and WRFM methods, beside the INORM method. The results are represented here in two tables TABLE  I. Comparison of recommendation quality in tests TABLE  II. comparison of recommendation leading to purchase, determining the number of recommendations in tests Number of equal F1s Number of larger F1s Percentage of F1 to be larger Percentage of F1 to be larger or equal Comparison of INORM with WRFM

For this purpose calculation the recommendation quality, the database should be divided into learning and recommendation data, in this research about 20 percent of information aren't entered to database in order to ask recommendation and then compare them to the true information based on the costumers' name in this method's information. The simulated software answer in three manners \(INORM, WRFM and CF investigated in diagrams after 128 times of executions after that the result are analyzed and investigated. To compare the observed statistics of INORM method with two method which are collaborating filtering and WRFM, one can refer to the table 1 At this observed INORM method increase the quality of recommendation to costumer in comparison with the collaborating filtering to 56.25 percent and represent it in 96.87 equal or better. In the same way in comparison of INORM with WRFM method increase the recommendation quality to 78.12 58 


The priority of INORM method comparing to other ones is obvious now, but we investigated the manner representing recommendation in INORM more regarding the number of recommendations The case in which the numbers of recommendation are 9 the recommendations leading to purchase in INORM method causes 75 percent increase. In CF method such as INORM method, the number of recommendations has 62.5 percent increases in ability of them. After doing tests for more recommendation the results are represented in table 2, which is a great success for INORM method to have more ability than the old methods V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION this article tried to tell the strength and weakness point of the recommendations method in electronic commerce, introducing a new method named INORM which uses the advantages of six current method and weakened their deficiencies , in order to have a new step in good recommendation executing INORM method for recommending to the costumers of a database of a store and its comparison with the recommendations represented by CF method and WRFM , at least 78.125 percent comparing to WRFM and 56.25 percent comparing to CF methods, increase had observed. The INORM method also takes costumer behaviors patterns into account to be useful for all kind of electronic commerce VI.
