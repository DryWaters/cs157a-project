HIDD E N Hausdorff distance based Intrusion Detection approach DEdicated to Networks Yann Labit Johan Mazel LAAS-CNRS Universit e de Toulouse 7 avenue du Colonel Roche 31077 Toulouse cedex 4 FRANCE  ylabit jmazel  laas.fr Abstract DoS attacks represent a big threat for the Internet While most of attack detection techniques are based on passive monitoring of trafﬁc we propose a detection method HIDD E N based on active measurements the objective being to make possible the real-time detection and classiﬁcation of DoS attacks without intrusive probing The originality of our contribution relies on the use of the entropy function computed from probabilities of time series of measured ICMP request/echo delays However the evaluation of the method exhibits a dramatic number of false positives It has then been enriched by the use of the Hausdorff distance on probabilities of time series which signiﬁcantly decreases the number of false positives In addition a method for discriminating ICMP attacks from others TCP/UDP attacks using icmp seq has been added Experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach have been run on the French operational RENATER network on which artiﬁcial attacks have been generated using TFN2K 14  R es ul t s exhibit that TCP UDP and ICMP DoS attacks have been accurately detected in less than 1 second 1 Introduction DoS attacks represent a big threat for the Internet and their detection and mitigation is a key research issue Most of previous work on attack detection has been concentrating on monitoring traf\036c using passive measurement techniques as in Intrusion Detection Systems This paper proposes an alternative approach based on active measurements the objective being to make possible the real-time detection of DoS 037ooding attacks without intrusive probing It relies on the assumption that delays will be impacted in case of attack The advantage of active measurement is its user oriented nature which allows anybody to cope with DoS attack detection whereas it is usually devoted to network administrators The end to end approach of active measurements also makes possible to detect attacks anywhere in the Internet from any source Active measurements would then signi\036cantly ease the design of a global attack detection system for the Internet Active measurements are very popular in the Internet for measuring delays loss rates inferring network topologies etc They are also used for estimating available bandwidth see tools as Abing Spruce Pathload IGI-PTR Pathchirp etc As for our attack detection method these tools aims at interpreting delay variations on pairs or trains of packets as changes in the link or path load 11  Ou r m eth o d th en r e lies o n a n a ly zing time series of measured ICMP request/echo delays The originality of this method relies on how this time series are computed in order to exhibit anomalous values corresponding to DoS 037ooding attacks and classifying them For this purpose and taking advantage of previous work on anomaly passive detection which demonstrated the bene\036ts of spectral 8 o r e nt rop y 6 a nal y s i s  our det ect i o n m et hod al s o computes the entropy from probabilities of RTT time series However 036rst results when working on the entropy function only were not convincing because of a high rate of false positives The methodology has been extended by the use of the Hausdorff distance on probabilities of time series which proved to signi\036cantly reduce this level of false positives Moreover it increases the level of true positives detected by the entropy function The paper is organized as follow section 2 presents the two needed concepts of entropy and Hausdorff distance Section 3 presents how our detection method HIDD E N has been assessed Especially it indicates how RTT time series in the presence of attacks have been built Then in section 4 experimenting our detection method on this RTT time series repository it has been possible to show that thanks to the Hausdorff distance estimations DoS attacks have been accurately detected in less than 1 second It also shows how the method performs in discriminatin g between ICMP and TCP/UDP attacks Section 5 proposes an evaluation of performances about false/true positives/negatives and the choice of Hausdorff distances Finally section 6 concludes the paper by describing ongoing and future work for improving and validating this method

2 Entropy and Hausdorff distance concepts 2.1 Entropy The entropy of a distribution was de\036ned by Shannon for the discrete laws de\036ned by its probabilities and was extended then to the continuous laws de\036ned by their density The entropy received a strong attention in information theory with physical analogies but it has also speci\036c properties to its probabilistic origin The relative entropy shows the difference between the distribution of the packet serie in the current network traf\036c and a well-known distribution packet serie If this difference is too large it indicates that a portion of some packet serie that rarely appear in the training data increases signi\036cantly or that appear regularly decreases signi\036cantly In other words this serves as an indication of the presence of an anomaly in the network traf\036c Entropy aims at measuring the uncertainty degree of various random experiments The use of entropy concept is motivated in this work by the need to estimate the disorder level in probabilities of RTT time series 2.1.1 Renyi and Shannon entropies It is often convenient to introduce generalized Renyi entropies before giving the Shannon one The Renyi entropy is a generalisation of Shannon entropy to quantify the uncertainty or randomness of a system The Renyi entropy of order 002 is de\036ned as R 002  X  1 1  002 log  n 003 i  1 p 002 i  1 where 002 002  0 p i are the probability distributions of  p 1  p n   which consist of non-negative numbers summing up to unity The Renyi entropy R 002 converges to the Shannon entropy in the limit 002 003 1 R 1  X   n 003 i  1 p i log  p i  2 2.1.2 Renyi divergences As well as the absolute Renyi entropies there exist the generalised relative divergence of order 002 which described an approximate distribution Q  X  from a well-known distribution P  X   D 002  P 004 Q  1 1  002 log  n 003 i  1 p 002 i q 002  1 i  3 The divergence of order 002  1de\036nedas D 1  P 004 Q  n 003 i  1 p i log p i q i 4 is the Kullback-Leibler divergence This last one has been used in MetroSec Project 10 i n pas s i v e det e ct i o n 12   2 In t h i s w o rk t he R e n y i e nt rop y and d i v er gence o f o rder 002  1areused 2.2 Overview of Hausdor\002 distance The Hausdorff distance measures how far two compact non-empty subsets of a metric space are from each other in topology Letís give an overview of the Hausdorff distance and a number of formulations about it 2.2.1 Directed Hausdorff distance and undirected Hausdorff distance Given two 036nite point sets A   a 1   a p  and B   b 1   b q   the Directed Hausdorff Distance DHD is de\036ned as h  A  B  max a 005 A min b 005 B 004 a  b 004 5 with d  a  B  min b 005 B 004 a  b 004 6 and 004Ä\004 is a norm on the points of A and B e.g.the L 2 or Euclidean distance between a and b  The function h  A  B  is called the Directed Hausdorff Distance DHD from A to B  It is noticed that the function 5 is not symmetrical it cannot thus be a distance with the metric direction However it is used much to measure a degree of similarity between two contours A and B Symmetry is usually restored by taking the maximum between h\(A B and h\(B A Then we obtain the de\036nition of the undirected or classic Hausdorff distance CHD H  A  B  max  h  A  B   h  B  A  7 H  A  B  max  max a 005 A d  a  B   max b 005 B d  b  A  8 The Hausdorff distance CHD H  A  B  is the maximum of h  A  B  and h  B  A   Thus it measures the degree of mistmatch between two sets by measuring the distance of the point of A that the farthest from any point of B and vice versa 2.2.2 Modiﬁed Hausdorff distances There is a great number of alternatives to the preceding de\036nitions which give better results shown in the 036eld of the recognition of form and the imagery In the case of the detection of anomalies the authors are not informed of work using the distances from Hausdorff classic or modi\036ed distance There are thus various ways of calculating Directed Hausdorff Distances DHD 4 Mo reo v e r  undirected Hausdorff distances can be also modi\036ed 5  By combining directed and undirected Hausdorff distances one obtains a great number of alternatives  Undirected Hausdorff distance alternatives H 1  A  B  min  h  A  B   h  B  A  9 H 2  A  B  max  h  A  B   h  B  A  10 H 3  A  B  h  A  B  h  B  A  2 11

It was assumed that the users are seated in their place with a laptop on the table in front of them, thereby mimicking a static scenario. Table 3 shows the chosen locations of the four laptops considered in this wo rk. These values represent the coordinates in the x, y and z planes and were given as input to the simulation model. For these receiving antenna positions, the delay, phase and attenuation of each multipath ray were recorded in order to generate the channel model This data was processed to extract the normalized Power Data Profiles \(PDP\d eventually the time dispersion parameters. Figure 6 shows the PDP of the laptop positioned at location 3, while Table 4 provides a summary of all the time dispersion parameters at positions 2, 3 and 4.

Coherence bandwidth is a measure of the flatness of the channel, i.e. the range of frequencies over which two frequency components have a strong potential for amplitude correlation [2 Tw o si g n al s  with frequency separation less than or equal to B c are affected similarly by the chan nel, otherwise the channel will introduce frequency selective fading For a frequency correlation f unction of 0.9 or above, the coherence bandwidth is approximately    1 50 c B r  Distance from antenna 265 


8 much less than the limit of 800ns for the GI given by the IEEE802.11a standard. Therefor e, this guarantees that the receiver will not experience ISI or ICI. The coherence bandwidth results show that the channel will only introduce flat fading as the values obta ined are much greater than the bandwidth of each subcarrier in the system, i.e. 312.5kHz 5  C ONCLUSIONS  A model of the wireless propagation characteristics inside a Falcon business jet based on RT techniques was presented This model includes reflection, transmission as well as scattering effects due to rough surfaces. The basic model was subsequently modified to allow the recording of the multipath characteristics such that the multipath distribution inside the Falcon\222s cabin could be determined A third extension to the model was implemented in order to extract the channel impulse response. Results obtained show that the channel is Wi-Fi \223frie ndly\224 as both time dispersion and coherence bandwidth parameters are below the allowable limits of the standard. This increases the confidence that a deployment of an IEEE802.11a system inside the Falcon business jet will be successful. Future work will involve the effect of passenger and terminal movements inside the cabin on the channel characteristics The simulation model can be easily extended to model IEEE802.11g systems since this technology uses OFDM However, this model needs a different approach to enable the performance evaluation of other technologies such as IEEE802.11b and IEEE802.11n. Nevertheless, since we apply a modular approach, th e propagation model will still hold, requiring only a change in the frequency parameter A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work forms a small part of the project E-Cab which is financially supported under the European Union 6 th  Framework Programme \(FP6\.

5 EVALUATION Evaluation experiments described in this section are conducted on a TI OMAP 1511 Innovator device which runs in frequencies up to 200MHz. It has 32MB ROM as well as 32MB RAM. The OS used is a version of embedded Linux, and the JVM used is Intent from TAO Group The source documents and stylesheets used for evaluation are randomly selected from Sarvegaís XSLTBench and DataPowerís XSLTMark [17  after initially excluding some unrealistic transformations. We select these two benchmarks as they are influential indust ry benchmark and that they both support XSLT benchmarking. Note that some of the large source documents are less likely to have recurrent structures in real-world applications. We included them regardless as they might help us understand the implication of document size on system performance. Table 1 lists sizes of sample documents and the transformation stylesheets used for them. Table 2 lists the raw numbers used in following discussions Documents are fully read into memory before any measurement starts to minimize external disturbance Warm-up runs are always conducted prior to real measurement runs 5.1 Tokenization Figure 12 compares the speed of Swift mode and Hash mode against the speed of Nature mode tokenization The Swift mode is by far the fasted, having a median speedup of 2.40 over Nature mode. The median speed of Hash mode is about 81% of that of Nature mode which means a median hashing overhead of about 23.5%. In the worst case, this overhead is about 37.4 for wai  5.2 DOM-style Parsing Figure 13 and Figure 14 compare speed of Structure Encoding based parsing against that of kXML parsing for both Receiver ID Assigning and Sender ID Assigning. In Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while in Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses Swift mode when cache hit ratio is 100% \(i.e., structure of incoming document is always in cache\ode when cache hit ratio is 0 Figure 13 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed is 4.34 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 1.35 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is in backwords and game which use the same source document\to 8 under Sender ID Assigning Figure 14 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 1.07 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.90 \(or an overhead of %11.1\ID Assigning is used. The worst sample is wai where the overhead is about 20.5% under Receiver ID Assigning. The reason Figure 12. Comparing Performance of Tokenization Modes Figure 14.

that Structure Encoding is a little faster than kXML even when cache hit ratio is 0 is likely because of the fact that, while we use kXML for tree building, we modified it slightly to interface it with our tokenizer which resulted in differences in execution traces and slight differences in runtime performance when execute in JVM Overall, these two figures demonstrate that Structure Encoding based parsing provides substantial speedup when structure recurrence is frequent, and incurs low overhead when such recurrence is rare 5.3 Transformation Similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare transformation speed of Structure Encoding based XSL processor against that of XT for both Sender ID Assigning and Receiver ID Assigning. Again, under Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while under Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses either Swift mode or Nature mode Figure 15 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed of Structure Encoding based implem entation is 5.38 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 2.72 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is trend  where the relative speed is over 39 for Sender ID Assigning, and over 25 for Receiver ID assigning Figure 16 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 0.996 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.918 or an overhead of 8.9 is used. The worst sample is nitf-stylized where the overhead is about 14.6% under Receiver ID Assigning These two figures show that Structure Encoding based XSL processing offers even higher potential speedup than parsing, yet incurs lower overhead in worst cases This is understandable as, typi cally, a large portion of operations in transformation is for costly structurerelated operations, which we have pre-processed offline. Note that, as long as structure recurrence is frequent, the potential improvement is very high \(up to a median relative speed of 2.72\even if the receiver has to calculate structure ID through hashing 5.4 Compression We conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of Structure Encoding based compression. In the experiment, for each sample document, we randomly changed the values of 3 rd 8 th  13 th i.e., one in every 5, starting from the 3 rd  attribute and text node values. Thus our experiment Figure 16. Comparing Structu re Encoding Based Transformation and XT  Cache Hit Ratio 0  Figure 15.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didnít measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
