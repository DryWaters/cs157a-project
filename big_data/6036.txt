Research of Adaptation Technologies for Web Interface WEI Wei School of Information Science and Technology Hangzhou Normal University Hangzhou310012, China keiko _ 49@163.com Abstract This paper proposed a new idea based on adaptation technologies for the Web Interface. Web usage mining is used as a mission for mining personalized information from users. We try to attack the problem from both function objects in the interface and the interface region It is helpful to design algorithms for finding frequent function objects pairs and a subregional set, which is based on association rules and adequate for this problem Combining with adaptation technologies, we propose an adaptive algorithm for Web Interface to realize this new idea. Being tested repeatedly by several users, this proposal has primarily realized the Web Interface Adaptation Keywords Web Interface, Web usage mmmg, adaption technologies, frequent pairs, subregional 1. Introduction With the increasing usage of Internet, Web Interface WI Information Exchanges. Resources and information used by people almost need to exchange by the WI. Yet the WI just provides a kind of timeless and changeless structure to meet demands users for functions. And this unchanging mode is studied by users, which results in many covered functions. Although most of adaptive web sites and software may adjust their interfaces by using the count of function objects. Essentially, it is little useful to help interface meet the user's requirements. When a people oriented concept is pouring into modem life, the study of the well-behave Web Interface will become a new hotspot 1 Web Interface has become an important intermediary which helps people get and use information from the Internet. And people would like to pick up the function they are interested in for interacting. However, designing an adaptive WI can improve and even solve this problem 


By considering frequency of object functions people used interface space and active states of object functions, user interaction ability and using behaviors will be deduced in order to build a personalized library. Using the adaptive 978-1-4244-6709-9/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 95 ZHAN Guo-hua School of Information Science and Technology Hangzhou Normal University Hangzhou310012, China ghzhan@hznu.com decision based on the library, the User Interface will be adjusted for meeting user requirements as far as possible Web Mining is a better measure to extract interesting and potentially useful patterns and implicit information from artifacts or activity related to the Wodd Wide Web 2]. According to the data category we use when getting personalized information, it can be divided into three categories [2]: Web Content Mining, Web Structure Mining and Web Usage Mining. Through taking advantage of these mining methods, we try our best to find new technology for deal with the WI adaptation problem In area of the adaptive interface, there are two important definitions 1 the frequency and probability of triggering function objects directly or indirectly by various methods 2 cumulative information content of events triggered in different regions Ideally, function objects can take seat according to the ticket number of subregions, which attributes so much to a lot of data, effective algorithms and suitable functions Http request User Interface Figure 1. Numerical performance of activity of every function object In this paper, Fig. 1 introduce adaptation technologies simply for Web Interface: given a personalized knowledge library mainly made up of the frequency ordered pairs set and subregion set and two algorithms for 


implementing WI. Firstly, we need to collect a large number of data from Web logs and temporary file stored in disks, which help us to gather information of user habits and relevant data of WI usage. Secondly, we therefore propose the Next Function Object algorithm which use statistical cluster mining to find cohesive object pair. Thirdly, it finds a place, a sub-region, where one function object should be arranged orderly. In other words frequency ordered pairs reflect the statistic on using function objects, and sub-region set show us a space partition relevant to user's interest or habit. Putting them together is the best way to make WI adapt individual user automatically 2. Study on Adaptation Technologies for Web Interface In this section we define two hearts of Web Interface adapting problem, describe our own approach, and present two algorithms' description 2.1. Related Work The research about how to create this novel interface has been very complex and covers many application domains, including adaptive interface framework, user behavior learning and etc There is an enormous difference between the traditional interface and the adaptive interface Redeveloping an adaptive interface framework is essential to the whole study. This framework is related to interface region division and automatic layout of function objects One of the most important properties is the constraint based on layout techniques. Two kinds of constraints are introduced: abstract and spatial [6]. Abstract constraints are descriptions of high-level relations between various components in the layout \(e.g. X references Y constraints are relations that directly express geometric structure of the presentation \(e.g. X above Y User behavior should be described by a special structure, which can help interfaces trace user footsteps and learning user habits. The complex of the structure might affect the efficiency of some algorithms, e.g prediction algorithm. The interface learns user behavior by computational approaches: Bayesian network mixed-initiative and model-based 


2.2. Predict user next movement The frequent pairs set from user action can help predict user next operation. Counting up function objects respectively is easy to find out the object user most frequently operates, which dose not mean we can pick out the one that would like to be used after back one. People's continuous movements are not unmeaningful. We hope to extract user next movement from the frequent pairs set Most people think that this prediction can be realized by frequency statistics of function objects usage. However there is a lot of information ignored by conventional thinking, for example relationship information among function objects, misoperation and something useful for getting subregional layout 96 In this paper, we focus on the relation between one and another function object. So this section describes an uncomplicated and new approach to reflect the number of operation of every function object and help find user's next movement. Suppose there are n functional objects we use an n-dimensional feature vector A = [A1,Az," ',A"f to store these objects. Fig 2 shows a matrix A* \(A* = AT . A the 4 anI an2 ann Figure 2. Numerical performance of activity of every function object feature vector. It is for getting a ji that we use Ai and A j from the log of every user on the server. a ji is the times of triggering the function object Ai in the train of Aj. The value of Ai 's activity is expressed numerically by computing ai = La ji The matrix P IS j generated by the A*. The P ji in the matrix P is calculated by conditional probability measure Pi = LP\( Ai I Aj j This prediction takes a web server access log as input and maps it into a form ready for clustering. Furthermore whereas traditional clustering is concerned with placing each function object in exactly one cluster [5]. Actually the algorithm has to adjust strategies in order to cater to 


practical needs because this recommendation is not always the best choice for user. The cluster mining mentioned in this paper, may place a single function object in multiple overlapping clusters. Based on the operate-coherence assumption, the NFOA \(Next Function Object Algorithm of related objects. The algorithm has five basic steps a b frequencies between function objects and create two matrixes A" and P c on conditional probability d graph and store these as rules library e recommended to use another \(itself or other want to have a next operation; Update matrixes A* and P then turn to c 2.3. Divide subregions of web interface The display of web interfaces is the layout of function objects. The statistics of the function objects alone is obviously not enough for achieving adaptive dynamic changes, because each user has a different regional interest for the whole interface. Except getting the frequent pairs set of the relevant objects, we should also analyze the regional interest degrees of the personalized interfaces. This way we can locate the suitable function objects in the suitable places and therefore achieve the adaptive effect for the interfaces. As shown in Fig. 3, it is doable and appropriate to represent the vertical and horizontal spatial location changes with two-dimensional grid [O,h] x [O,g] for the layout of the web interfaces [3 Y: \(0, g 0,0 X: h, 0 DElD Function objects lnterface subregion Other interface subregions Figure3. Example of interface region and function objects in web interfaces 


The overall interface has been divided into an interface subregion set R = ? ,r2 ,    " rn} by function objects The number of function objects is n. The region is divided into n pieces. Each interface subregion is defined by rj as \(x j ,Y j ,S r j Prj  and interest degree in the whole interface. \(x j ,Y j represents the coordinates of the center point of the subregion in the interface; S r is the regional area of the J region; Pr means the information density [4] of the J subregion. The calculation formula \(1 follows 97 n I Sr J is the statistics for the information amount of n triggering events bn OJn is the weight of event bn. It should be noted that the interest degree of the users for the region is reflected not only by the information density function Pr but also by the information increment J M rj of the region rj, especially for intermittent interest changes of the users where it can feedback the user interest in time. The interest degree of subregions is determined by the r function, Check formula \(2 interest degree of each subregion Sr Ir r ___ J _._ J _.p \(2 ISrj I I rj j The updating of interfaces should be determined by the vitality degree P; of the function objects and the interest degree r j of the interface regions. And function objects 


are not independent but a little adhesive. The reflection of each function object Ai in the interfaces are marked by Gi Gi is defined to be \(Xi'Yi,SAi P Xi'Yi represents the coordinates of central region of function objects. S A i is the grid region of the function object P; is the vitality of the function \(0 ::;; P; < 1 known that the number of neighborhoods nb different interface regions is different \( 1 ::;; n{rj So the formula \(3 object Ai and interface subregion rj e\(p o'J ,p,Jd\(o",p,J I I  p J '? "EN\('j d\(o'j,pJ P",pJ 3 dtp r ,p r be calculated in the data pre-processing phase. Purposely the interface fitness function \(3 interface in an optimal state of harmony. We hope to solve the problem by converting it into dynamic planning mainly achieving an optimal solution for each function object Ai and subregion rj through the dynamic planning algorithm, namely with the maximum match value and minimum distance During the interface adaptive process of the function objects, the overall adaptability value should be maintained optimal. Only in this way can the function objects Ai and subregions rj be undated with the following rules a function objects; Gridding of the interface region based on function objects Ai forms the set of the initial interface subregion b P; of Ai and the interface subregion rj is not larger than that in the past, it means the users are used to the mode changes. The function keys and regions are not adjusted, and the interfaces are not updated 


c interest region that matches its vitality, which means if the interface region can't meet the region of the function objects, each Ai has the threshold Restraints make it 0  is achieved in the calculation of adaptability. The dynamic update replacement happens only when    Aj={1,2, .. ,n}&&j*i may need to be adjusted, too d be re-divided Based on the above description, the threshold value of the matching between function objects and interface regions stabilizes after several updates. The initial threshold is O. Each interface update leads to the adaptive change of  functional objects and interfaces are. In other words, the larger the overall interface accords with the user rules 3. Experiment and conclusion The web interface used in the experiment is IE6.0 browser. The viewable region area calculated from the screen resolution is 779 x 600. There are 9 function keys namely function objects. 4 people use the interface. The server and machine in the experiment run in Windows XP system, producing near 2 thousand records First of all, we get values of some important parameters from the database and logs on the server i.e. a ji ,P ji' I{bn  from our estimation value slightly, but we know that users' needs can be met sometimes by communicating with our experimenters. Secondly, methods investigation 98 of users' requirements was conducted using questionnaires and communication face to face The NFOA is simple and easy to implement which helps servers save a part of computational effort required because it does not find a whole path - an ordered pairs queue records all of function objects user will operate. In a way, finding the next ordered pairs out of n function objects needs to pick up any two function objects and then search all pairs for the best pairs as the next movement 


recommendation, which requires O{n2 time complexity is reduced to O{n of the matrix P to find the next function object seems to know the Ai as long as \(Ai '  A j a ji' However, getting the subregional set is still a big problem because of difficulties in getting the amount of information and setting rules of layout. It is even as experimenters say: the layout of a whole interface is not always satisfying. Our detailed technical and aesthetic analyses indicate that it needs an additional interface rules set for adjusting the layout slightly to user's visual Moreover, more factors still should be taken into account for example, time place and so on Although adaptation technologies for web interface have implemented initially, there are still more work waiting for us 4.

The level of weighted confidence of is critical to the filteration of association rules on the circumstance that the defference of confidences of different assortments is not so clear 509 ThP1.7  V. SUMMARY According to the actual needs of supermarket customers according to season, product type, sales staffs experience,it first divide commodities into big categories, set up the weighted value of categories, through analyzing customer shopping basket", it filters out the item sets whose weight is small and which divisors have no need to care about while it selects out the item sets whose weight is big and which divisors need to care about and find the item sets which meet the minimum weighted confidence; Then, by calculating the weighted confidence, it finds the valuable association rules Thus it can not only find the interrelation of different commodities , but also mine data according to commodites and divisors refered transaction. how to set reasonable weights has great influence on the result of data mining, and need to be further studied  REFERENCES 1] Qiu-Yu, Cao Hua.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
