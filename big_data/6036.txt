Abstract 
204The world wide web can be viewed as a repository of opinions from users spread across various websites and networks, and today\220s netizens look up reviews and opinions to judge commodities, visit forums to debate about events and policies.  With this explosion in the volume of and reliance on user reviews and opinions, manufacturers and retailers face the challenge of automating the analysis of such big amounts of data user reviews, opinions, sentiments\ Armed with these results sellers can enhance their product and tailor experience for the customer. Similarly, policy makers can analyse these posts to get instant and comprehensive feedback. Or use it for new ideas that 
democratize the policy making process. This paper is the outcome of our research in gathering opinion and review data from popular portals, e-commerce websites, forums or social networks; and processing the data using the rules of natural language and grammar to find out what exactly was being talked about in the user's review and the sentiments that people are expressing. Our approach diligently scans every line of data, and generates a cogent summary of every review \(categorized by aspects\ along with various graphical visualizations. A novel application of this approach is helping out product manufacturers or the government in gauging response. We aim 
to provide summarized positive and negative features about products, laws or policies by mining reviews, discussions,, forums etc Keywords\204sentiment analysis; opinion mining; data visualization; review mining

 I NTRODUCTION  Today the sheer volume of data being that is generated ever is enormous and making any sense out of that data is a tedious task. However, constant efforts and research in this area have led the automation of the process to some extent. With this project, we aim to further this automation process. Using a combination of data aggregation techniques, NLP, linguistic analysis and popular visualization techniques we generate 
 
visually appealing and easy to understand graphs which provide summarized feedback. This is done by performing detailed sentiment analysis on the data. The fields of opinion mining and sentiment analysis are distinct but deeply related Opinion mining focuses on polarity detection [positive negative or neutra  w h e r e a s se n t i m e n t a n a l ysi s in vo l v e s emotion recognition. Because detecting the polarity of text is often a step in sentiment analysis, the two fields are usually combined under the same umbr  The problem we are trying to solve is best described by considering a few scenarios. Consider the Google Nexus 7 tablet\(7-inch, 16GB, Black\t has over 1,754 distinct reviews  Am azon alo n e. T a k i n g i n to accoun t j u s t on e s o cial media platform \(let\220s say Reddit\the quantity might grow by 
a digit or tw  s u c h a s c e n ario, i m a g i n e a  m o bile manufacturer, say HTC. They launch their flagship product the HTC X\(hypothetically\hich is an instant hit on the Internet with lots of end users posting positive reaction. But is there a way for the manufacturer to amass and individually examine hundreds of thousands of reviews, spread across the web and then use that data for the benefit of the organization Is it possible to analyze the sentiments of the user in what he wrote about the HTC X? How about analyzing not just the positive/negative quotient of the post \(which isn't of much use because it done not tell why a statement is positive/negative but also getting a summarized feedback on what users liked and disliked the about the HTC X  
C o n s ider an oth er s c e n ario of th e g o v e rnm e n t of a coun tr y   Say the government wants to connect to hundreds of thousands of people and analyze their views on a proposed policy. If they launch the discussion on a forum, would it be possible for the Government to manually analyze what exactly the users disliked about the policy or law and relevant metrics related to it? And what parts of the policy did the voters like Example: Tax cuts\  Or summarize the final, most popular suggestions out of those many reviews  There has been significant research and progress in this area of sentimental data analysis and opinion mining. Walter Kasper and Mihaela Vela designed a very efficacious system to analyze the sentiments in Hotel reviews, in their paper titled 
217Sentiment Analysis for Hotel Reviews\220 h e s y st e m  designed by us is able to provide answers to the above practical and generic scenarios, and could prove to be an excellent resource for enterprises, thought-leaders or anyone for that matter in the gathering, sentimental analysis summarization and visualization of data related to their purposes. The system does not only take into account the holistic sentiment expressed in a review or even a sentence but further breaks-down each review into sentences, and the sentences again into tokens, to analyze the sentiment corresponding to each relevant token individually, and then 2014 IEEE

The first challenge faced while performing SA on data was in respect with the veracity of the collected data i.e. the quality of the data. When collecting reviews or opinions posted by end users, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of that data. Some may post positive or negative opinions because of deep rooted brand loyalties. It is also important to make sure that the corpus that is being analyzed contains reviews or opinions form actual end users of the product and have not been posted with ulterior motives. We aim to overcome this problem by using lager data sets which have been gathered from trusted and well know sources on the internet Once the quality of the data being used has been satisfactorily established, the next major challenge is the analysis of this non standardized data. People have different ways of expressing opinions; they may or may not use correct grammar. Moreover, there is an ever increasing trend of using shorthand\220s and acronyms at various online platforms. This is major a challenge while trying to process natural language and analyzing sentiments Since the data collected is from such a wide variety of sources, it presents other, more fundamental challenges. The text that is gathered may or may not be in English. It is difficult to process any information that is not in English unless there are pre-existing linguist tools for the language. Even when the text gathered is in English, it may have some local influence words form the local language, references etc\. Spotting and successfully analyzing such occurrences is a complex task The other major challenges faced pertain to the sheer volume of data that is being gathered and applying the right preprocessing filters on this data for cleaning and pruning. We use a combination of efficient code and well established data transformation techniques to meet these challenges  III output as well as phrase structure trees Summarizing sentiment and in particular summarizing sentiment by extracting and aggregating sentiment over ratable aspects has been a very active area of research recently. The work of Matthew Feczko and Andrew Schaye[5  ha s  demonstrated a multi-step methodology that combines cutting edge techniques in multi-document summarization, polarity classification and sentiment analysis. IT automatically synthesizes, filters, and summarizes user product reviews into a short list of positive and negative opinions as expressed in the reviews Xiaohui Yu and Yang Liu present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA+[6 w h ich n o t o n ly can ca p t u r e  the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews, but has the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available.

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
