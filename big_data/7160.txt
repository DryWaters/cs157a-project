Efficient Algorithm for Extreme Maximal Biclique Mining in Cognitive Frequency Decision Making  Fan Zhong-Ji, Liao Ming-Xue, He Xiao-Xin, Hu Xiao-Hui, Zhou Xin Institue of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Beijing, China fanzhongji@hotmail.com   ABSTRACT The cognitive radio is growing an important interest in wireless communication study. A cognitive radio ad hoc network may take a master-slave tree-based structure in some special applications. For a master node with limited communication capability, slave nodes usually use the same frequency to access a subnet managed by the master. Each slave node can acquire many frequencies for communication by a local spectrum sensing process. However, there may be no common set of frequencies available for every slave node. In 
this case, we should delete some slave nodes and keep other nodes staying in the subnet as many as possible. By mapping the node set and frequency set to be both parts of a bipartite graph respectively, the problem can be turned into a special case of searching for maximal bicliques. Based on a wellknown LCM \(Linear time Closed itemset Miner\ algorithm which enumerates frequent item sets \(maximal bicliques\nd using a new technique in terms of dynamic thresholds, we have solved this problem in real time to meet requirements of most cases from our application. And we also improved the LCM algorithm by pruning more rows and columns of vertices in a bipartite graph and by mining more heuristic information about what vertices make others unclosed to achieve much better performance Keywords-maximal bicliques; dynamic thresholds; cognitive radio ad-hoc network; frequency decision 
I  INTRODUCTION Frequent item set mining is an important problem in data mining and has many applications such as Associating Rule Min 2], li f e sc ienc e d a t a ana lys i s 3] and induc tiv e database. Enumerating frequent closed item sets, a subproblem of frequent item set mining, can be stated as follows [4  Gr ap h m i ni ng is also an i m p o rtant and ac tive research topic in data mining field. Enumerating maximal biclique from a graph can be one-to-one correspondence with the enumeration of closed pattern pairs [5  an d the  problem is described as follows Let G  V  E be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E A pair of disjoint nonempty subsets V 1 and 
V 2 of V is called biclique if u  v   E for all u  V 1 and v  V 2 Define   v  as the set of all vertices in G that are adjacent to v i.e   v   u  u  v   E For a nonempty subset X of vertices of a graph   X e set of common neighbourhood of all vertices in X  For an existing biclique subgraph H  V 1 
 V 2  E the biclique subgraph is a maximal biclique subgraph if   V 1  V 2 and   V 2  V 1  Many real-life applications can be modeled by maximal bicliques or closed pattern pairs. One example is given here For social relation, common characters of persons can be modeled by maximal biclique which is useful in commercial filed. Surprisingly this idea has similar scenario in wireless communication filed In this paper, we propose a new application in CRAHNs\(cognitive radio ad hoc networks Supp o s e  that there is a simple network consisting of a master node 
and several slave nodes. The slave nodes only communicate with the master node directly and they must use the same parameters decided by the master node, such as frequency Each slave node in the network firstly senses electronicmagnetic surroundings and then determines which frequency set can be used for communication and this process will cost too much time and energy. After gathering all frequency sets from slave nodes, the master node then decides to use which frequency for communication and backup several frequencies for use in future because of high cost of the sensing process. It does not need too many backup frequencies as these selected frequencies are not valid over a certain long period. However, maybe there is not a frequency which can be used by all slave nodes since the 
electromagnetic surroundings are complex. Under this condition, not all slave nodes can stay in the network and it is the master node to decide the remnant slave nodes and the common frequency set of them. How to choose the slave nodes and the frequency set is the problem called CFDM Cognitive Frequency Decision Making We can model CFDM by enumerating maximal bicliques from a bipartite graph in which one part represents the node set while the other part represents the frequency set. For a maximal biclique of the graph the master node can make the slave nodes represented by one part of the biclique remnant and use the frequency set represented by the other part Enumerating frequent item sets and enumerating maximal bicliques from a graph are both long studied. There 
are several algorithms for these problems at present, such as CHARM CL O S ED+ [7 FPclose [8] [9  LCM  Linear time Closed itemset Miner\ [1 4 1 5  f o r enu m e r a t ing  frequent item sets and [5   10 11 1 2 f o r enum e r ati ng maximal bicliques. However, all these algorithms are enumerating all maximal bicliques or closed pattern pairs For CFDM problem, we are only interested in the best solution defined later in this paper. Considering good performance of LCM, we choose it as the base of our algorithm. There are three versions of LCM for different ___________________________________ 978-161284 486-2  1 1 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


applications including enumerating frequent, closed and maximal itemsets. We select to mo dify their function for enumerating closed frequent item sets to solve the CFDM problem The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the details of CFDM. In Section III and Section IV, we introduce the algorithm LCM and our algorithm EMBS \(Extreme Maximal Biclique Searcher experiments and results are listed in Section V. And Section VI is the conclusion II  CFDM  PROBLEM  DETAILS Let Net  N   F  E N be a network with node set N  frequency set F and the relationship E N among nodes and frequencies. The pair n  f    E N represents that the node n  can use the frequency f to communicate with the master node A solution to the problem is a pair of subsets N i    N  F i    F  where the master node retains nodes in N i and uses one frequency in F i for communication. Let the set of all solutions be S and the limit of the frequency is f m  S should satisfy below conditions to meet requirements of CFDM  S  N i  F i  N i    N  F i    F  N i  F i    E G  F i    f m 1     N i  F i   S   f   F i   n  f   E G  n    N i 2    N i  F i   S   n   N i   n  f   E G  f    F i 3 Let G  V 1    V 2  E G be a bipartite graph with vertex set V 1  V 2 and edge set E G To model the network, let the node set N be V 1 and the frequency set F be V 2 If there is a pair of n  f n E N add the corresponding pair into E G  Therefore, the graph can be modified to G  N    F  E N  and the set S of all solutions in Net is the set of all maximal bicliques in G because the conditions satisfied by S are equal to those satisfied by maximal bicliques However, we are only interested in the best solution B m  N m  F m i.e., the best maximal biclique \(also called extreme maximal biclique\, satisfying \(4   B i  N i  F i   S  N i  N m    N i  N m    F i  F m 4  III  LCM  ALGORITHM In this section, LCM algorithm is described in graph format while it is described in the database format in original paper [4   Th is work h a s b e e n d o ne d eta ile d l y i n 5  and h e r e  we only list the information needed in this paper. For a bipartite graph recorded in a matrix, the rows of the matrix represent one part of the graph as the columns of the matrix represent the other part. Before an introduction to the LCM algorithm, some notations will be given bellow Let G  V 1  V 2  E G be a bipartite graph. The characteristics of a maximal biclique have been given in the section I. For a biclique B  X  Y the set X and Y are called closed sets if and only if B is a maximal biclique, else they are called unclosed sets. For a vertex v    V 1    v he neighbourhood of v and id v he position of v in V 1 which is sorted by   v easing order For a matrix recording a bipartite graph, let X be a part of a maximal biclique X is empty at the beginning.

Figure 2  An example of the process of recursion  A  Dynamic thresholds In our algorithm, we introduce two parameters p m and q m  representing the best maximal bicl ique to be foun d currently In LCM, the thresholds are constant and the algorithm enumerates all maximal biclique. In EMBS, only the best maximal biclique will be saved and the thresholds will be dynamically updated according to the biclique found. Fig. 1 will show this difference In Fig. 1 M is the matrix sorted, and m and n are the amount of rows and columns of M respectively. \(a\f Fig.1 is the pruning tree of LCM and \(b\is that of EMBS. The italic sets are the leaves or pruned branches while the boldfaced sets are maximal bicliques found The difference is caused by dynamic thresholds p m  q m  The pair p m  q m is always \(2,2\ in \(a\of Fig.1 produced by LCM. But in \(b\ Fig.1 from EMBS p m  q m changed to 2, 3\ when the first maximal biclique is found and it is changed to \(3,3\ when the second one is found. Because of the increasing in the thresholds, more nodes are pruned in part \(b B  Improve the judgment of closed state Let X be the first parameter of the function LCM_Iter According to the pseudo code X is increasing continuously in recursive process while   X is decreasing. For parameter v if there is a vertex u not included by X id u   v nd   X   u      X   v hen X   v is not closed. If id u  id v and   X   u      X   v the vertex will be inserted to X with v together. So we do not iterate on vertices with id less than that of v For each step S iterated from a step S let Y be the set of the vertices selected from S to S and let u be the vertex making X unclosed in S If u 012 Y  X  Y   v is not closed also because   X  Y   u    X   u     Y    X   v    Y    X  Y   v d   X   u      X   v  So at step S we can record the vertex making v unclosed and keep this information valid for S to skip some evaluations on closed states until S returned. But if the vertex u has been inserted into Y  X  Y   v may be closed. At this condition the state of X  Y   v should be recomputed LCM algorithm uses arrays unclosed_u and unclosed_v  to manage the closed state. If u makes v unclosed at step S  set un closed_u  v   u and unclosed_v  length   v while a variable length is used to indicate the length of unclosed_v  All elements put to unclosed_v by step S will be sorted by the corresponding values in unclosed_u When iterating on a vertex i at step S LCM deletes all values which are not bigger than i from the tail of unclosed_v and clear the corresponding values in unclosed_u also Fig. 2 is an example to show this clearly. In Fig. 2 M is the input graph and p  q are two thresholds. From S 0 to S 7 is the recursion order starting from set {5}.The sets marked italic are unclosed sets. Table in Fig.2 shows the process of transformation of unclosed_u and unclosed_v  unclosed_u 1 is set to 3 at step S 2 and is cleared at step S 3 But at step S 5  unclosed_u   is r ecom p ute d an d reset I n  fa ct the val ue 3 o f  unclosed_u  sho ul d be  i gno r e d o n ly when the ver t e x 3 h a s  been in the selected set In EMBS algorithm, each vertex in V 1 has a stack to manage closed states. Firstly zero is pushed into every stack and suppose that u is the vertex making v unclosed in S i  u  will be pushed into stack of v and it will be valid until u is Figure 1  The difference of the pruning tree of LCM and that of EMBS 


selected or S i returns. If S j is an offspring step iterated from S i  and only if u is selected in S j closed state of v will be recomputed, or there is no any calculation on closed state about v in step S j When step S i returns, every stack changed in S i will pop the top value. While using stacks to manage closed states, each operation except computing closed state can be completed in O 1\ time and the result of computation can be used more effectively. After optimizing, the process of sorting for unclosed_v is cut while all redundant recomputation of closed states is reduced C  Reduce the size circularly In LCM algorithm, only the vertices in one part of the graph are reduced by the relationship of the neighbourhoods In EMBS algorithm, all vertices in both parts of the graph are reduced. After reducing the vertices in one part, the neighbourhoods of the vertices in the other part are changed simultaneity. So we should reduce the other part again until all the two parts can not be reduced any more Fig. 3 shows two matrices reduced by LCM and EMBS M is the original matrix M 1 is the matrix reduced by LCM and M 2 is the matrix reduced by EMBS. It shows that the matrix reduced by EMBS is smaller than the matrix done by LCM.

In EMBS algorithm, the both line 2 and 3 are to reduce the size of the matrix circularly, and lines between 9th and 14th of function EMBS_Iter represent the improvement for judgment of closed state V  EXPERIMENT  AND  RESULT We evaluate the efficiency of EMBS with dynamic thresholds by running on different size of graphs and evaluate that of EMBS without dynamic thresholds by comparing it to LCM algorithm. The experiments are conducted on randomly generated matrices representing bipartite graphs. Our computer for experiment is a PC with a 3.0GHz CPU and 1GB of memory Table I shows the performance of EMBS with dynamic thresholds on randomly generated bipartite graphs in different size. Row one is the size of the graphs and m  n  means that there are m vertices in the part representing nodes and n vertices in the other part representing frequencies. Row two is edge density of the graphs. If there are m  n vertices and w edges in the graph, the edge density will be calculated by w  m*n The first column is the threshold of frequencies while the threshold of nodes is 1. The number in the table is time in milliseconds and data of first two size graphs are in integral number while others maintain two digits after decimal point Figure 3  Matrices processed by LCM and EMBS  


To evaluate the efficiency of EMBS with dynamic thresholds, we use four different sizes of graphs to represent different size of subnet. The biggest value of threshold of frequencies is eight because we only need to keep at most eight frequencies to use over a certain long period. The threshold of nods means that one node is needed at least. We can find that the running time of EMBS with dynamic thresholds is below one second at most times. This performance meets the real-time requirements of our applications. In some cases, the running time is still very long. However, these cases are very rare in real applications Table II shows performance of both LCM and EMBS without dynamic thresholds on different number of vertices and edge density. At each row of the table, the performance is averaged over five randomly generated graphs of the same vertices and edge density. The thresholds are both one in this case. Note that both LCM and EMBS here are searching for all maximal bicliques \(complete bipartite graphs\ not only for the extreme maximal biclique. The first column of the table is the amount of nodes in each part of the graph. The second column is the edge density in the graph. The third column is the amount of all maximal bicliques ever found The maximal bicliques found by LCM and those found by EMBS without dynamic thresholds are the same. The forth and fifth columns are running time of LCM and EMBS while the sixth column is the ratio of data in the fifth column and data in the forth column. The last column denotes the performance improvement of EMBS, and obviously EMBS without dynamic thresholds performs better than LCM according to Table II. The first reason is that we reduce the time for judgment of closed state, though the pruning tree of EMBS and that of LCM are the same. The second reason is that EMBS can reduce the graph better than LCM, especially when the edge density of graph becomes little   TABLE I  P ERFORMANCE OF EMBS  W ITH D YNAMIC T HRESHOLDS ON R ANDOM B IPARTITE G RAPHS    Vertices  64+512 32+256 16+128 8+64 Densit y Threshold 10  30  50  70  90  10 30 50 70 90 10 30 50 70 90  10  30  50 70 90  1  40  34  47  55  87  29 4 7 11 17 1.73 1.39 1.80 2.55 2.82  0.50  0.64  0.77 0.81 0.89 2  5  34  47  55  87  2 5 7 12 17 0.77 1.47 1.79 2.42 4.46  0.49  0.66  0.76 0.82 0.86 3  8  52  92  76  89  2 4 9 15 17 0.77 1.51 2.11 3.18 2.89  0.52  0.70  0.71 0.77 1.49 4  15  144  493  489  95  3 11 16 24 17 0.99 2.02 3.30 5.36 2.81  0.52  1.98  0.78 0.77 0.85 5  18  356  2,099  3,486  109  3 13 51 34 17 1.06 1.79 3.66 5.08 2.72  0.51  0.75  0.75 0.84 0.85 6  32  668  8,251  13,477  149  5 26 101 63 18 0.99 2.20 6.56 6.57 3.44  0.52  0.77  0.81 0.83 0.89 7  36  1,083  19,450  68,684  551  4 34 193 194 17 1.09 2.82 8.31 13.65  3.13  0.52  0.80  0.85 0.83 0.82 8  42  2,049  45,016  340,940  11,295  6 62 432 969 17 1.09 2.88 14.70 16.84  2.74  0.50  0.91  0.94 0.86 0.86  TABLE II  P ERFORMANCE OF LCM AND EMBS  W ITHOUT D YNAMIC T HRESHOLDS ON R ANDOM B IPARTITE G RAPHS    Vertices Edge density Maximal biclique Time of LCM milliseconds Time of EMBS milliseconds Ratio Performance Improvement 1-Ratio 100+100 0.10 1,371 120 80 67 33 100+100 0.20 11,340 102 95 93 7 100+100 0.30 96,809 896 848 95 5 100+100 0.40 844,410 8,594 8,235 96 4 100+100 0.50 11,264,781 120,075 113,920 95 5 200+200 0.10 13,640 132 126 95 5 300+300 0.10 59,296 787 731 93 7 400+400 0.10 178,732 3,282 2,908 89 11 500+500 0.10 433,874 10,156 8,672 85 15 1000+1000 0.01 4,233 45 43 96 4 2000+2000 0.01 35,322 511 417 82 18 4000+4000 0.01 419,076 9,399 6,964 74 26 6000+6000 0.01 1,823,122 60,598 44,910 74 26    


VI  CONCLUSION In this paper, we discussed a new application named CFDM \(Cognitive Frequency Decision Making\ in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks. Based on a well-known algorithm LCM for frequent item set mining, the CFDM problem has been solved by our algorithm EMBS \(Extreme Maximal Biclique Searcher\erfectly through introducing the idea of dynamic thresholds. Benefiting from dynamic thresholds EMBS can prune small maximal bicliques efficiently to find the extreme maximal biclique. Therefore, most CFDM problems can be solved in real time. We also improved the performance of LCM algorithm itself in two aspects: reduce the size of the graph and reduce the time for judgment of closed state. We found that the performance of EMBS with dynamic thresholds relates to the thresholds while the performance of EMBS without dynamic thresholds relates to the edge density of the graph. And the experiments show that EMBS outperforms much more than LCM Nevertheless, we now just solve CFDM problem in one subnet. In real-life applications, there may be more than one subnet. Therefore, the future work may focus on how to solve CFDM problem in cases following. One is that there are several unattached subnets and slave nodes can communicate to several master nodes. Another is that the subnets in a network are organized in tree-form topology One slave node in a subnet may be the master node in another subnet so that deleting one node in a subnet may remove a large branch of subnets in the whole network. In such case, we should assign more weight on some special nodes to prevent such node from being deleted when searching for maximal bicliques. And we should develop more efficient algorithm to achieve real-time performance in some very large wireless networks, though such networks are very rare in current applications. Still, the future work also includes those related applications with different definitions of extreme maximal bicliques. For example, some applications may be interested in maximal bicliques which includes the most nodes in both parts of a biclique  1  R. Agrawal, and R.

one to submit a textual query a description logic DL sentence or SQL-like query and the use of a reasoner to get an appropriate answers The following list contains potentially useful queries  subClass or superClass of a given class type  subProperty or superProperty of a given property type  what type of class all or direct superclasses a given instance is  whether two given instances or two types are the same or different  what is the value of a speci\036ed property of a instance  all the instances of a class  all the properties of a given instance The above queries can improve the access to large hierarchically structured document collections in order to support such as knowledge-repository exploration or cross-repository exploration V A PPLICATIONS Retrieval models involve indexing processes representation for documents and queries matching operations between them and criteria of similarity to extract results This section describes two models that exploit ontologies of records to search on collections The 036rst is keyword-based while the second uses the semantic features of ontologies for exploration A Keyword-based retrieval model Web search engines generally are keyword-based search They choose documents according to Boolean combinations of term matching conditions and similarity measures  T his section describes a keyword-based model that retrieves clusters of records from XML ontologies Here records are treated as documents queries as speci\036cations of clusters of documents and ontologies as the structures that store documents of collections Ontologies of records can be regarded as trees that cluster metadata documents so that each k level cluster is described by a k term label For each cluster each of its documents contains the k terms of its label The Boolean model the VSM model or latent semantic indexing can be adapted to search on ontologies However they would produce lists of non-related documents Thus we have developed a model that searches for relevant clusters through matching operations between queries and cluster labels XML ontologies are used for this purpose since the model only requires the labels of each cluster In the proposed model natural language queries are converted to keyword-based queries Query keywords are extracted after a stopword elimination process The stopword list used is formed by intersecting the stopword lists of CACM and Time collections 7  Keywords are case-insensitive 7 The collection of Communitcations of the ACM CACM and the Time collection are available at http  ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test c ollections June 16th 2008 Algorithm V-A describes the search process on the ontology of a collection It comprises two main stages selection of potential clusters and application of a similarity function This algorithm uses the following de\036nitions  Length of a query  The number of query keywords  Potential cluster  A cluster for which a similarity measure between query keywords and the cluster label is equal or greater than a threshold  Potential collection  The set of potential clusters  Similar record  An element of a potential cluster Also Algorithm V-A uses the following conventions  A query q of m terms is represented as a tuple q  q 1 q 2  q m  where m is the length of q  Query terms are connected with AND operators  An ontology of records is brie\037y represented as a tuple O\(t,d,c,r where t is the number of nodes at the 036rst level it corresponds with the number of frequent 1-itemsets d is the number of levels c is the number of clusters and r is the total number of records The root cluster has level 0  C\(l indicates that l is the label of a cluster C  S\(q,l denotes a similarity function between a query q and a cluster label l   card\(X represents the cardinality of a set X  that is the number of elements of X Algorithm V-A Algorithm V-A input q q 1 q 2   q m  query of length m  O\(t,d,c,r ontology of records output P  potential collection begin 1 determine the set C of c potential clusters such as 005 q i  q i 006 c\(l  0 007 i 007 m  2 for each c 006 C do 3 add the label l to the list of labels L c 4 for each label l 006 L c do 5 apply S\(q,l 6 order L c in a descendent way according to S\(Q,l 7 form a sublist L r by selecting the 036rst n labels from L c  where n is the maximum number of potential clusters 8 for each label l r 006 L r 9 retrieve the similar records of each cluster c  l r  to form P 10 if card\(C  n  P  P 010 P  where P is the set of relevant documents according to the Boolean model applied to q and the root cluster of O\(t,d,c,r end  Function 9 measures the similarity between the label l of the cluster c and a query q q 1 q 2   q m   S  q l  005 q i w  q i   0 007 i 007 m 9

where q i represents a query keyword and w q i  is the average of the weights of q i in the feature vectors of cluster c  Algorithm V-A makes retrieval faster because it applies the similarity function S\(q,l only to cluster labels instead of all records of an ontology Intuitively labels with more terms represent more speci\036c topics than labels of ancestor clusters A retrieving task using multiple collections requires the management of multiple ontologies For this purpose the 036rst 036ve steps of Algorithm V-A are implemented per collection in such a way that Lc contains the labels of all potential clusters Steps 6 7 8 and 9 are implemented without any modi\036cation Step 10 requires to generate the union of root clusters of the participating ontologies This task eliminates duplicate documents The representation of the potential collection P in the web interface shows a tree of clusters that enables the retrieval of groups of similar documents The tree has links that allow users to access metadata documents B Ontology-based exploration model This section describes an exploration model that uses the semantic features of ontologies of records At this point it is assumed that an ontology of records of a collection has been constructed and mapped in XML RDF and OWL languages The input to the ontology-based exploration model is a structured query which is generated from a form-based interface where the user selects an implementation of the ontology and enters queries about the path of the elements of the ontology such as classes relationships or property values The query is executed against the chosen implementation to obtain a result which is formed by instance tuples that satisfy the query The result is encoded in XML to form a response XML ontologies can be queried with XML query languages or parsers We use XPath  to allo w u sers to address parts of ontologies through the hierarchical structure of their elements In this implementation ontologies of records are regarded as sets of nodes and attributes RDF and OWL implementations have enough expressive power to represent the semantics of the real world information in machine-accessible ways The former has formal syntax formal semantics and XML Schema datatypes while the latter is the standard recommended by the W3C for Semantic Web At the time of this writing there is no standardization of query languages for RDF and OWL We have used Jena 8  a tool with some degree of support for OWL and RDF to search on these mappings where queries express conditions involving domain ontology instances document properties or classi\036cation values The keyword-based retrieval model and the ontology-based exploration model are similarity-based retrieval tasks 8 Jena A Semantic Web Framework for Java http://jena.sourceforge.net June 16th 2008 VI C ONCLUSIONS This work presented OntOAIr an ontology learning method to construct lightweight ontologies from multiple document collections The method is based on four main tasks harvesting representation clustering and formalization The harvesting task obtains the documents from the collections The representation task constructs a vectorial representation for each harvested document The clustering task applies an exclusive hierarchical algorithm to the vectors in order to produce a tree of clusters The implementation task transforms the tree of clusters into a lightweight ontology The construction of ontologies requires minimal human intervention We used the FIHC algorithm proposed by as the exclusive hierarchical clustering algorithm for which and we proposed an adaptation Experimental evaluations have shown that the FIHC algorithm is as at least as good as UPGMA algorithm and bisecting k-means algorithm The ontologies constructed by the OntOAIr method constitute a data model able to provide an unambiguous and shared terminology that human and software agents can both understand and use Ontologies are also an information retrieval model on their own because they support indexing and retrieval The indexing process is based on two tasks 1 the selection of informative elements of each record and 2 the organization of the records in data structures that enable the search The retrieval process has been implemented through the keyword-based retrieval model and the ontology-based exploration model These models assume that a record that does not match any term in the query is not relevant An algorithm to establish similarity between queries and groups of records has been developed for the keyword-based retrieval model We have conducted some small scale experimentation and as a result we have demonstrated that the effectiveness of the keyword-based retrieval model is similar to that of the vector spaces model Further experimentation and larger document sets are needed to test and improve our method The OntOAIr method can be used to support manual construction of ontologies to cluster the responses of search engines or as a basis to support reasoning in Semantic Web contexts As future work we propose three tasks for the maintenance of these ontologies 1 the inclusion of a set of records in a previously constructed ontology without compromising the accuracy of the clustering or the effectiveness of the retrieval 2 the management of versioning which should help to keep track of their evolution and 3 the incorporation of inference mechanisms that search through the ontologies and deduce results in an organized manner in order to complete missing information Inference can be used for implicit query expansion or to automatically maintain the consistency

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
