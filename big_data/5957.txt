An Empirical Study on the Concentration Ratio of Stockholders Equity and the Corporate Governance Performance in Listed Companies Yang ShuiLi             Yang Wanshun  School of Business Administration; Xi'an Univ ersity of Technology; Xi'an  710048; China slyangxaut@126.com Abstract With the 169 listing enterprises of machinery equipment and instrumentation industries as the samples and by means of the 2004 002\003\004 2006 data, this paper deals with the empirical relation among the first major shareholders equity ration, the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio and Z index and the corporate governance performance. The research results indicate that, before the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is not in obviously correlation with the corporate governance performance, but in remarkable correlation with the agency cost, and that the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio is in significant correlation with the corporate governance performance. Z index is in the significant negative correlation with the corporate governance performance. After the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is in significant positive correlation with Tobin’s Q value and the agency cost, and the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio is in significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in significant negative correlation with agency cost; and also Z index is in significant negative correlation with corporate governance performance 1. Introduction Research on the relationship between the ownership structure and the Corporate Performance was started by Berle and Means 1932\, they held that the company stockholder's rights dispersion degree and the company performance appeared to the reverse correlation relationship. But a formal study was made by Jensen and Meckling \(1976\, they held that the company's value depended on the proportion of internal shareholders’ shares [1 D e m s etz \(1 9 8 3    contended that there should not exit a fixed relationship between the company performance and the shareholding structure [2  S t u l z   1 988  studies showed that there was a curve relationship between the value of the company and the proportion of internal shareholders’ shares [3   The domestic empirical study results on the concentration ratio of stockholders equity and corporate performance were also inconsistent Accordingly, the empirical conclusion can be divided into four basic types: positive correlation negative correlation, uncorrelation and curve correlation. Xu Xiaonian, Wang Yan \(1999 shared the view that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a significant positive correlation with the market value of the total assets and book value ratio. But it was in weak correlation with return on total asset and return on net asset [4   Z h an g H o n g j u n 2000  reach ed t h e conclusion that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance by the analysis of the relationship between the top five major shareholders equity ratio and Tobin Q [5  M i ngHua Ga o  Ya ng J i ng 2004\ selected the return on net asset \(ROE\ and the earnings per share \(EPS\to measure corporate performance, and obtained the conclusion that the concentration ratio of stockholders equity was in a basic uncorrelation with corporate governance performance[6   Bu t t h e co rp o r at e g o v e r n an ce performance indicators covering the companies accounting profit indicators, indicators of corporate value and cost indicators should be selected to carry out the assessment of the company governance performances. This paper mainly deals with the relationship between the concentration ratio of stockholders equity and corporate governance performance before the reform and after the reform

2. Theoretical analysis and assumptions Before the reform of equity shares dispersion, there exists a general phenomenon of one big share in the listed companies in our country. The first major shareholder’s impact on corporate governance performance has both positive and negative effects The first major shareholder has the higher proportion of share-holding and holds the controlling interest of the listed company. In considering their own interests the major shareholders of listed companies have more enthusiasm to operate their listed companies well, and must take a certain effective incentive and supervision and restraint methods, enabling operators to work hard so as to maximize the interests of shareholders Accordingly, the enterprises have paid much more attention to their long-term development, in such a way that their performance will increase, but accompanied by an increase in a corresponding agency cost. As viewed from that sense, the higher concentration of equity shares will be beneficial to the business. in the case of absolute controlling interest, the first major shareholders will lack of constraints so that they are likely to take advantage of their own absolute controlling interest for the occupation of the interests of listed companies, as viewed from that sense, the higher concentration of equity shares will not favor to the normal operation of the company. There are two main aspects of equity shares constraints of listed companies First, Shleifer \(2000\ suggested "the t unnel effect" and he held that in the highly centralized equity shares and in the case of weak equity shares constraint, the major shareholders often took the advantage of affiliated transactions to transfer business interests, at the expenses of the interests of small shareholders to seek their own interests [7 On t h e o t h e r h a n d t h e s t u d y  con-ducted by Xu Liping et al \(2006\ showed that much high equity shares constraint relationship could make the shareholders mutual involved, whereby reducing the efficiency of the decision-making business so that there could be a negative impact on the performance of listed companies 8  W i t h th e completion of China's stock reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio has been gradually declining but other major shareholders decline in the equity ratio far below the first major shareholders decline in the equity ratio. The share reform made the concentration ratio of stockholders equity reduced and the relationship of equity shares constraint decreased gradually that was, Z index decreased gradually. As the level of Z index would affect the major shareholders’ behavior and the company's operating efficiency, the lower is the Z-index, the more it will favor the company's operating. We assume that there is no "tunneling effect" that the major shareholders are more willing to obtain the increase in personal income through normal operating by the company's performance increase rather than non-normal means Before the share reform, the following assumptions can be made: H1: before the share reform, the first major shareholders equity ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance and agency costs. H 2 before the share reform, the second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the negative correlation with agency costs. H 3 before the share reform, Z index in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance After the share reform, the phenomena of different rights of the previous tradable and non-tradable shares have been changed so that the interests of tradable and non-tradable share-holders tend to become the same whereby a corporate governance basis of common interests has been formed. As a result, the managers of listed companies have been converted into corporate valuable managers, to the sustainable development of the company. The objective of the management committee can be correspondently transformed into the maximization of the company, because the effect of changes in the prices of the securities market shares upon their rights and interests can be less than the benefits brought about by its operating company performance. the following assumptions can be made:H 4 after the share reform, the first major shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with the Tobin’s Q value and agency cost.H 5 after the share reform, the second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the negative correlation with agency costs. H 6 after the share reform, Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance 3. Research design 3.1 Sample selection and data sources According to the SFC Industrial Classification standard \(CSRC\, in this paper, the listed companies of machinery, equipment and instrumentation industries of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock in the year of 2004 and 2006 are taken as samples. Finally, 169 companies are obtained. Data from the Chinese Center for Economic Research Service are used to study

3.2 Variable Selection The used governance performance indicators in the study by many research scholars are: earnings per share, return on total asset, net profit, the Tobin’s Q value, information disclosure index agency cost, and relate party transaction, stock profit, stock net rate, stock sale rate, debt assets ratio, How ratio, quick ratio, the growth rate of total assets, the growth rate of operating revenue contribution rate can be obtained quickly According to a \(k 002 85%, earnings per share, return on total asset, the Tobin’s Q value, information disclosure index, and agency cost, are selected as the measurable indicators of corporate governance performance. These study variables in this paper including the explanatory variables, controlling variables and Interpreted variables are divided into three categories, of which the explanatory variables include the state-owned stock variable, the legal person ratio and the flow stock ratio. The control variables are taken from the asset-liability ratio and the size of companies. Interpreted variables are expressed by performance indicators, with the concrete conditions as shown in table 1 3.3 Model Construction Based on the above assumptions and theoretical analysis, we assumed the regression function model  1  3 2 1 0 002 e E LETT SIZE P i i      002 002 002 002  where P i represents the corporate governance performance variables, with earnings per share, return on assets Tobin’s Q value, information disclosure index, and the acting interpreted variable costs 003 0 is the intercept 003 i Table 1.

i = 1,2,3,4\ is the regression coefficient; e is the residuals. E i is stake for the concentration of variables i = 1,2,3\, being the first big proportion of shareholding ratio, and the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio, Z index 4. Empirical Studies 4.1 Description analysis of statistical variables It can be seen from Table 2 that the first major shareholders equity ratio of the mean value appears to have the de creasing trend from 2004 to 2006. But there is no change in the maximum values. The second to the fifth largest share-holding ratio of the mean is 16% in 2004; the highest in 2005 to 17%, and reduced to 16%in 2006, which appears to have an inverted U-shaped varying trend, of which the minimum value appears to have an increment trend The Z index's change is more obvious. We may see that the years of 2004-2006.the concentration ratio of stockholders equity is in the gradual reduction each net income, the property return rate, Tobin’s Q value and the information disclosure appear to have the upward U change tendency along with the year change, but the agency cost appears to have the downward U change tendency, whereby indicating that the 2005 reform enables the stockholder's rights structure to have the immense changes, resulted in corporate governance performance was greatly improved in 2006 4.2 Statistical regression analysis of variables It can be seen from Table 3. that the variable regression results of the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio and corporate governance performance show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, indicating that the regression equation is significant, whereas 003 3 Table 3.

coefficient of agency cost is less than zero, and the rest of 003 3 coefficients of other governance performance variables are greater than zero, and 003 3 significance is SigT <0.05. This can prove that the assumption H2 is established. The variable regression results of Z index and corporate governance performance show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, whereas 003 3 coefficient of agency costs is greater than zero, and 003 3 significance is SigT <0.05. Assumption H3 is established. The variable regression results of the first big proportion of shareholding ratio and corporate governance performance is SigF <0.05 003 3 significance is SigT <0.05. But 003 3 significance of other governance performance variables is SigT 0.05 but empirical conclusions and assumptions H1 are inconsistent It can be seen from Table 4, the Tobin’s Q value regression equation is SigF <0.05, and 003 3 coefficient is greater than zero, and 003 3 significance is SigT <0.05.Whereas the significance of other governance performance variable regression equation is SigF> 0.05, and 003 3 significance is SigT 0.05. These show the empirical results can prove that the assumption H 4 is established. The variable regression results show that the significance of regression equation is SigF <0.05, and 003 3 coefficient of agency cost were less than zero, and 003 3 coefficient of other governance performance variables were greater than zero, and 003 3 significance is SigT <0.05. Show that the second to the fifth largest shareholding ratio was positive correlation with corporate governance performance, and was negative correlation with agency cost. The Table 4.

assumption H 5 was established. The variable regression results of Z index and corporate governance performance showed that the significance of regression equation were SigF <0.05 the regression equation significantly, and 003 3 coefficient of agency costs were greater than zero and 003 3 coefficient of other governance performance variables were less than zero, and 003 3 significance was SigT <0.05. These showed that with the decrease of the Z index, and other corporate governance performance variable was a significant increase. This proved that assumption H 6 was established. After the reform, the relationship of checks and balances had played a significant role in performance decrease of Z index can increase checks and balances to the first major shareholders 5. Conclusion of the study The listed companies of the machinery equipment and instrumentation industries are selected as the studying samples with the following conclusions obtained:\(1\ Before the share reform the first major shareholders equity ratio is not in the significant positive correlation with corporate governance performance, but is in the positive correlation with agency cost. Empirical studies have proved that there exist the “tunneling effect” in China's listed companies and controlling shareholders of listed companies can harm the interests of listed companies by their absolute control advantages. The second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance, Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance.\(2\fter the share reform, the first major shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with the Tobin’s Q value and agency cost. This shows that compared with corporate governance performance, the major shareholders are more concerned about market value of the company The second to the fifth shareholding ratio is in the positive correlation with corporate governance performance and in the negative correlation with agency costs. This shows that with an increase in the second to the fifth shareholding ratio, this is was conductive to the improvement of corporate governance performance. Z index is in the negative correlation with corporate governance performance This shows that the degree of relationship between the equity share constraints or the checks and balances will produce a great impact on the corporate governance performance 6.

to develop alternative runtime decision algorithms in order to speed up the runtime decision logic The FFTW library optimizes Fast Fourier Transform FFT operations To compute an FFT the user has to invoke 002rst a planner specifying a problem which has to be solved The planner measures the actual runtime of many different implementations and selects the fastest one In case many transforms of the same size are executed in an application this plan delivers the optimal performance for all subsequent FFTs Since the planner can be time consuming FFTW also provides a mode of operation where the planner comes up quickly with a good estimate which might however not necessarily be the optimal one The decision process is initiated just once by the user Thus FFTW makes the runtime optimization upfront in the planner step which does not perform any useful work On the other hand ADCL integrated the runtime selection logic into the regular execution of the applications This is especially important since the ADCL approach enables the library to restart the runtime selection logic in case signi\002cant deviations from the original performance e.g due to changing network conditions have been observed FFTW has  to a limited extent  also the notion of historic learning namely with a feature called Wisdom  The user can export experiences gathered in previous runs into a 002le and reload it at subsequent executions However the wisdom concept in FFTW lacks any notion of related problems i.e wisdom information can only be reused for exactly the same problem size that was used to generate it Furthermore the wisdom functionality also does not include any mechanism which helps to recognize outdated or invalid wisdom e.g if the platform used for collecting the wisdom is signi\002cantly different than the platform used while reloading the wisdom VI C ONCLUSION This paper presents a new set of algorithms which have been designed in order to reduce the time spent in the runtime decision procedure of the Abstract Data and Communication Library ADCL by incorporating historic knowledge from previous executions The algorithms use the notion of an acceptable performance window  which is de\002ned as the relative performance penalty an application is willing to accept compared to the fastest possible version for the sake of a faster decision procedure Furthermore the algorithms establish the notion of a maximum distance for each entry in the history 002le The maximum distance provides a measure which indicates when the winner function of a particular entry will lead to an acceptable decision for other entries Using these mechanisms we de\002ned two alternative algorithms for recommending a version to a new unknown problem size one algorithm uses the recommendation of the closest problem found in case the distance between the new problem and the closest problem is below the maximum distance de\002ned for the closest problem the second algorithm introduces a weighted vote among all entries in the history 002le whose distance to the new problem size is below their maximum distance The algorithms presented also contain an automatic measure for indicating when to dismiss recommendations based on historic knowledge This safety net is based on comparing the predicted performance vs the real performance of the recommended code version We evaluated both algorithms for three different function sets using two different network interconnects The results indicate a reasonable rate of good recommendations by both algorithms the weighted vote algorithm outperforming usually the one based on the closest problem size Our future work includes an extended analysis of the new algorithms for other communication patterns such as circular shift operations or broadcast operations Of special importance is the evaluation of the new algorithms within the context of adaptive HPC applications In a long term we also plan to include further runtime selection algorithms such as including early stopping criteria or 2 k factorial design algorithms for v ery lar ge p arameter spaces R EFERENCES  R C Whale y and A Petite Minimizing de v

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
