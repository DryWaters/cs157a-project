However, the degree of\nautomatic test generation and test coverage are big challenges in\ntesting. Concerning these problems, two approaches are proposed\nto test the on-board module of an advanced satellite-based train\ncontrol system model.\nThe ?rst approach is a model-based test generation technique\nbased on Coloured Petri Nets \(CPNs includes\na behavioural module of the on-board subsystem model and\ntwo other modules for the application environments of the on-\nboard subsystem model. The behavioural module and modules\nof application environments form a closed system. The expected\noutput of a test case is extracted from a path of the reachability\ngraph of the test model. Beside the CPN based approach\nfor generating test cases, another model-based test generation\ntechnique is applied. This method uses a special Petri net dialect\ncalled Safe Place Transition Net with Attributes \(SPENAT this case. No environment of the test object\nhas to be modelled, because of the possible input/output modelling\nwith a SPENAT. Thereby, a SPENAT is an open system and its\ntransitions can be triggered by external events with parameters\n\(external data of a \(complete closed system and SPENAT based \(open\nsystem as the on-board subsystem model\nin this case, could be done by testing. At last, the results of\nboth approaches are discussed and the advantages as well as\ndisadvantages are illustrated.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNowadays system development is shifting from informal\ntextual speci?cations and manual coding techniques to a\nmodel-based and tool-supported automated code generation\nprocess. With model-based system development formal meth-\nods can be applied during the developing process. Given a\nsystem model designed for system development, executable\ncodes of the system can be generated automatically from\nthe model following certain transformation rules. Hence the\nquality of the model is vital for the developed system.\nTo improve and ensure the quality of the system model,\nseveral techniques could be applied simultaneously, e.g., for-\nmal analysis simulation and testing. All these techniques\nshould be carried out from the very early stages of the model-\nbased system development process, e.g., the stage of functional\nhigh-level design, which produces a high-level abstract model\nfocusing on functionalities of the system. Testing aims at\nverifying the conformance of the system model behaviour with\nthe system requirements. The earlier the defects are detected,\nthe lower the cost will be. If executable models of different\ndevelopment stages are used for performing tests, tests are\nable to be executed at very early stages in model-based system\ndevelopment processes.\nModel-based system development centralises the develop-\nment of the system model in early stages for system design.\nAn executable system model has the advantage of testing\nvia simulation or model execution in the phase of system\ndesign Based on the well-known “V” model of testing and\n“V” representation of the lifecycle in the railway application in\nnorm EN50126 [1], testing could be integrated into the model-\nbased system development process for railway applications as\ndescribed in Fig. 1. By integrating testing into the model-\nbased development process, several times of testing process\nwill be carried out during the phase of system design. However,\nthe efforts of testing several times could be reduced by the\nidea of reusing the test suites for different models of different\nabstraction levels. Taking the view of black-box on models\nof different abstraction, the test suites can be reused if the\ninterface de?nitions of the models of different abstraction are\nconstant.\nII OVERVIEW OF THE SATZB MODEL\nIn order to derive a test model with Coloured Petri Nets\n\(CPNs or CP-nets  from the requirement speci?cation doc-\numents of SatZB, it is necessary to get a general understanding\nof this satellite-based train control system.\nSatZB \(German “Satellitengestu¨tzer Zugleitbetrieb satellite-based train control system, which uses\nGNSS data to provide the location of the train for automatically\ntrain control.

Integration of testing and model-based system development\nsubsystem and a trackside controller \(traf?c control centre GSM.\nA. CPN Model of the SatZB\nA ?rst CPN model with continuous simulation capa-\nbility of SatZB without considering time constraints has\nbeen developed previously at the Institute for Traf?c Safety\nand Automation Engineering, TU Braunschweig. There are\n?ve modules: On-board, Communication, Traffic\nControl Centre Localisation Unit and Train\nMovement. Each module represents the corresponding sub-\nsystem \(or component SatZB where Communication\nrepresents the communication system between the on-board\nsubsystem and traf?c control centre, and Train Movement\nstands for the movement of the train and the system environ-\nment. The Localisation Unit is an on-board unit in the\nreal system. More details of the modelling approach and the\nwhole established model can be found in [5].\nSince the CPN modelling language supports the develop-\nment of hierarchically structured models, the SatZB model\nhas been established in several abstraction levels. There is\na top level net for each subsystem model. It shows the\nconnections of one subsystem model to other subsystem model\nand the corresponding communication channels on an abstract\nlevel. The second level is subsystem level. On this level,\nmultiple scenario nets are used to describe the behaviour\nof the relatively independent subsystems, i.e., the on-board\nsubsystem and the traf?c control centre. A scenario net of\na subsystem model describes a speci?c process of internal\ndata processing with respect to the incoming data from the\nenvironment of the subsystem model. In addition, function\nblocks are coordinated with scenarios on this level for the\npurpose that different scenario nets can call the same function\nblock, which is realised by using fusion places [2]. On the\nthird level, each net represents either a detailed scenario net\nor a detailed function block.\nB. Scenarios and Scenario Nets\nIn railway engineering, scenarios [3] are usually used to\ndescribe a number of operation processes, in which sets of\nfunctions are involved. Scenarios de?ne operational situations\nLocUnit Onboard TCC\nlocation report \(loc  mb1 loc mt1 processes with respect to the environment of the system\nin focus; they show how the system and its components\n\(subsystems behaviour of a system or a\ncollection of components, embedded in a comprehensive oper-\national process; and it is determined in an unambiguous way\nby speci?c starting conditions and a sequence of events in the\nenvironment of the components in focus. For instance, follow-\ning text selected from the functional requirement speci?cation\nof SatZB describes the scenario that releases a block section\nfor the train’s running. We call this scenario RUNNING.\n“The train that in a train station or on a free block section\nhas received a movement authority for the next block section\nand has/hasn’t entered this block section. A release for the\nfollowing block section is/isn’t required.”\nFor scenario depictions, sequence diagrams of UML [14]\nare adopted. A sequence diagram is a kind of interaction\ndiagram that shows the interaction between objects over time.\nThe requirement \(scenario RUNNING are\nthree objects: LocUnit, Onboard and TCC representing\nthe localisation unit, the on-board subsystem and the traf?c\ncontrol centre, respectively. The diagram illustrates that when\nthe on-board subsystem receives a location data \(loc immediately. If the value of the location data is\nequal to the a MA point stored by means of the on-board map\nin advance, then a movement request \(message mb1 a point that\nwhen the train passes over, a movement request should be sent\nto the traf?c control centre Consequently, if the train wants\nto enter the following block section, a movement authority\n\(message mt1 the block section is required.\nHowever, the distinction between the scenario nets in the\nsystem model and scenarios for describing the operational\nprocess of the system should be clari?ed. In the CPN model of\nthe SatZB system, the scenarios such as described in Fig. 2 are\nrealised by exchanging tokens between different scenario nets\nin different subsystem or component models. A scenario net of\na subsystem model is a page 1 that describes a speci?c process\nof internal data processing with relation to the incoming data\nfrom the environment of the subsystem model. For example,\nthe scenario net SCE RUNNING in the on-board subsystem\nmodel is a page that shows the process of internal data\nprocessing, which is the consequence of the reception of a\n1A page is a part of a CP-net that links to other pages through shared places\nand thereby enables to exchange tokens between pages in different layers.\nTCC\nTCC\nOnboard\nOnboard\nInput\nMessage\nMSG\nOutput\nMessage\nMSG\nLocation\nData\nLOCATION\nLocUnit\nLocUnit\nFi g. 3.

TESTING WITH CPNS\nPetri nets are well-known as adequate means of descrip-\ntions for distributed systems and the system 


behaviour of\nconcurrency. The environment of the on-board subsystem of\nSatZB, i.e., the traf?c control centre is characterised by the\nconcurrency of delivering different commands to the on-board\nsubsystem while taking the on-board subsystem as the test\nobject. Thus \(Coloured the test model. Due to the length limitation of the\npaper, the introduction of CPNs will not be presented here and\nwe recommend the book [2] to a starter.\nA. Test Model\nThe CPN modelling language supports the speci?cation of\nhierarchically structured models, which makes it possible to\nwork with different levels of detail and abstraction.\n1 e.g. Fig. 2 that describe the\nscenarios of the train control system, the top level of the test\nmodel could be speci?ed as in Fig. 3. The object elements of\nthe sequence diagram are mapped to substitution transitions\non the top level of the test model, representing the respec-\ntive subsystems; the messages transmitted between objects\nare represented by the tokens on the places connecting to\nthe objects. Place Location Data, Output Message\nand Input Message represent the communication channels\nbetween different modules. These communication channels\nare simpli?ed as one-way channels under the condition that\nSatZB is a real-time system, and only one message would\nbe transmitted on a communication channel at the same time.\nMoreover, we suppose that the communication system of\nSatZB is fully reliable.\n2 sequences, all the scenario nets and\npossible combinations of scenario nets need to be cov-\nered. To exemplify our testing approach, ?ve scenarios of\nthe on-board subsystem are considered. These scenarios\nare STANDBY RUNNING, CONDITIONAL RUNNING,\nBAN OF ENTRY and EMERGENCY STOP, which lead\nto ?ve scenario nets SEC STANDBY SEC RUNNING,\nSEC CONDITIONAL RUNNING, SEC BAN OF EN-\nTRY and SEC EMERGENCY STOP accordingly. The\nswitchovers between different scenario nets in the system\nmodel are depicted in Fig. 4, where the mb1 and mb5 are\nmessages requests messages\nmt1, mt2, mt3, mt4, and mt5 \(commands STOP\nSCE_CONDITIONAL RUNNING SCE_BAN OF ENTRY\nmb1/mt1\nmb1/mt4\nor\( /mt4 mt4  mt4 to TCC from TCC nsubsystem model\nlegend\nFig. 4.

Page of the submodule Onboard\nmodel of traf?c control centre to the on-board subsystem\nmodel.\n• Submodule Onboard\nThe main idea of this page is to re?ect the interactions\nbetween the on-board subsystem model and its environment\nillustrated in the sequence diagrams. From the given interpreta-\ntion of the sequence diagram in Fig. 2, we conclude that send-\ning movement requests and switchovers of scenario of the on-\nboard subsystem model are determined by the received location\ndata from the model of localisation unit and the messages\nfrom the model of traf?c control centre, respectively. This is\ndepicted in Fig. 5. When a location data is received from the\nplace Location Data, it is compared to the on-board map\n\(tokens on the place OB_Map MA Points speci?c\nmessage \(either mb1 or mb5 the marking\non the place Onboard Scenario. The current scenario\nof the on-board subsystem model, indicated by the marking\non the place Onboard Scenario, is varied depending on\nthe messages received from the place Input Message.\nPlace Serial Number is used to synchronise the submodule\nOnboard and LocUnit, which will be introduced in the\nfollowing subsection.\nn\(n,loc Data\n1`\(1,"notPt 2,"Pt 3,"notPt submodule LocUnit\n[msg="mb5"]\n[msg="mb1"\norelse msg="mb5"]\nCONDITIONAL\nRUNNING\n[msg="mb1"]\n[msg="mb1"]\n[msg="mb1"]\nMSGMSG\nBAN OF ENTRY\nEMERGENCY\nSTOP\nSTANDBY\nRUNNING\nInput\nMessage\nOut\nOutput\nMessage\nIn\nmsg\nmsg\nmsg\nmsg\nmsg\n"mt3"\n"mt1"\n"mt2 n"mt5"\n"mt4"\nFig. 7. Page of the submodule TCC\n• Submodule LocUnit\nThe location data are the stimuli that trigger the operation\nof SatZB model, so the submodule LocUnit of the test model\nfocus on putting out location data from the place Location\nData in a desired order and the time interval between two\nconsecutive data. The order of the output data is controlled by\nadding an additional indicator \(integer number 


time interval between two consecutive data is controlled\nby using the fusion place Serial Number. According to\nFig. 5 and Fig. 6, we can see that only the received message\nfrom the module TCC has been processed, the integer number\non the place Serial Number can be increased by one. Then\nthe next location data can be put out.\n• Submodule TCC\nThe task of the submodule TCC of the test model is to\nsend commands \(e.g., movement authorities considering all possible commands\nin a simple way. In Fig. 7, when a movement request mb1\nis received by the place Output Message, one of the\nfollowing four commands mt1, mt2, mt3, or mt4 could\nbe sent out as a response via the place Input Message,\nand which one to be sent is random; if the cancellation of\nemergency stop request mb5 is received, then either mt4\nor textttmt5 will be sent out. It describes a situation that if\nmore than one command could be sent out \(to the on-board\nsubsystem same\npossibilities to be delivered.\nB. Test Case Generation\nA test case is a speci?cation, which consists of input and\nexpected output. The input part of a test case is called test\ndata [4]. In general, test cases will also include additional\ninformation such as descriptions of execution conditions or\napplicable con?gurations.\n1 as well, the input data\nof a test case is the location data assuming that the model of\nthe traf?c control centre is fully reliable \(in fact, this is easy\nto be ensured in the test model, see Fig. 7 data\nrepresent the location of the train on the rail track, which is\ndivided into block sections. Therefore the border of the block\nsections and the MA points are of interest. As a ?rst model for\nthe SatZB, we assume that the MA point of each block section\nis identical with the border of each block section. Then two\nlocation data Pt and notPt, representing the train is at the\nposition of a MA point and not a MA point respectively are\nsuf?cient for the system model.\n2 scenario sequences, which indicates the coverage\nof the whole requirement speci?cation of the system the\nreachability graph that generated by state space analysis with\nthe CPN Tools [6] is used to generate the expected output.\nAll possible paths of reachable states could be identi?ed if\nthe state space is ?nite. Each of such paths corresponds to\na possible sequence diagrams or a possible combination of\nsequence diagrams Accordingly, the expected output of a\ntest case \(i.e., tokens on speci?c places possible path. For the given example, Nevertheless,\nconsidering SCE STANDBY as the initial scenario net of\nthe on-board subsystem model, at least three location data are\nneeded \(e.g., in a sequence of notPt, Pt, notPt be\nable to activate all transitions in the test model. Obtaining the\nsequence of test data from the module LocUnit by initial-\nizing the place GPS Data with a multiset [2] 1’\(1,“notPt 2,“Pt 3,“notPt paths are identi?ed form the\nreachability graph, which has 66 nodes and 84 arcs. In other\nwords, 24 expected outputs \(e.g. tokens on place Output\nMessage and Input Message model.\nIV. TESTING WITH SPENAT\nA. Introduction of SPENAT\nThe SPENAT \([12], [13 safe\nplace transition nets \(p/t net     is possible to use\nexternal and parameterised signal/events as transition triggers\n\(in contrast to STG [9 SIPN [10], IOPT [11 reactive system with a Petri net. Also, the\nmapping of existing models onto a Petri net should be possible\nin an easy and intuitive way. For a SPENAT it is possible to\nuse attributes with arbitrary data type for handling internal\ndata states. Also ports and signals with parameters as external\nevent triggers for the transitions can be declared. With these\nfeatures one can model a system and/or component behaviour\nwith a SPENAT like a well established input/output box. An\nexample of a declaration of a SPENAT as a Petri net reacting\non externally parameterised signals is presented in Fig. 8. This\nSPENAT has two transitions where transition t2 can only ?re\nafter transition t1 and the guard of t2 depends implicitly on\nthe value of the parameter x of the trigger event of t1. If\ntransition t2 of the SPENAT of Fig. 8 ?res, it is clear that\nthe parameter x of the external event ev1\(int x msg.x < 2 with externally parameterized signals/events\neffect of t1 \(y = msg.x y > 0 The\nkeyword msg is a reference to the respective trigger event of\nthe transition. In this case the value 1 is the only valid value\nfor parameter x of the trigger event ev1\(int x transition t1 cannot ?re \(see guard\nmsg.x < 2 has been ?red.\nThere are methods for veri?cation and test generation based\non SPENAT models. These methods use well known Petri net\nmethods, especially the construction of the \(complete 9 with the use of SPENAT based methods. Therefore a\nmapping of a UML state machine on a SPENAT is necessary.\nThese methods are described in more detail in [12] \(see also\n[13 


Subsystem Model\nTo develop a SPENAT model for testing the on-board\nsubsystem model of SatZB, a simple SPENAT modeller was\nused \(see Fig. 10 with parameters, ports,\nattributes, data types as text with an easy and simple textual\ndeclaration notation see Fig. 9 MovAuth,mt enumerable. Ports pTCC and pLoc, representing the\ninterfaces of the on-board subsystem model that interact with\nthe model of the traf?c control centre and the localisation\nunit respectively, are used to trigger the transitions in Fig. 10.\nAttribute scenario indicates the current scenario net of the\non-board subsystem model For the behaviour modelling, a\nsimple graphical notation can be used. With this graphical\nnotation, a normal Petri net can be modelled. Besides this there\nare some simple extensions with respect to normal Petri net\nrepresentations for convenience reasons. Transitions between\ntwo places with one pre- and one post- place are represented\nby a simple arc. Junctions for a better representations of\npossible branches can also be used They have the same syntax\nand semantics like junctions of a UML state machine [14].\nThe SPENAT model \(see Fig 10 13 transitions. For the modelling of\nthe necessary properties 4 enum types, 3 input signals with\nparameters, 2 ports and 1 attribute for handling the scenario\nnets of the on-board subsystem model are textually declared\n\(see Fig. 9 for testing on-board subsystem model\nC. Test Case Generation\nThe generation of test cases can be controlled by the use\nof test coverage parameters. With the highest test coverage\ncriteria “All Paths” for each executable path of the SPENAT\none test case is created. For the identifying of all executable\npaths, the complete pre?x of the SPENAT unfolding is created.\nThe complete pre?x of the unfolding of a Petri net includes\nall possible markings \(states  the\nrelevant Petri net. The complete pre?x of the SPENAT speci-\n?cation model of the on-board module has 64 conditions, 32\npre?x events and 19 alternating processes. Therefore for the\non-board module 19 test cases were created. The calculation\ntime for the complete pre?x construction took 0.094s or 94\nms. In Fig. 11 one generated test case is illustrated as a\nsequence diagram, whereby for each port one lifeline was\ninserted. The generated test cases have the same abstract level\nas the speci?cation model \(CPN model and SPENAT model the using in real world test sessions, a transformation from\nthe abstract, logical level to a practical usable level must be\nrealised.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAiming at automatic test generation and test coverage con-\ntrol, two model-based approaches using CPNs and SPENAT\nFig. 11. A generated test case with the on-board subsystem model as SUT\nrespectively are proposed to test the On-board subsystem\nmodel of an advanced satellite-based train control system. The\ntest model developed with CPNs is a closed system including\nthe environments that interact with the on-board subsystem\nmodel, while the test model developed with SPENAT is an\nopen system whose transitions are triggered by external events\nwith attributes.\nFor the CPN based approach, test cases are derived from\nthe reachability graph that generated by the CPN Tools, and\nthe test cases cover all functional requirements. As to the\nSPENAT based approach, test cases are generated in a similar\nmanner but with the use of a \(complete external signals with parameters as transition triggers are\nrealised by a special marking representation of the SPENAT.\nTherefore open systems can be modelled and also the state\nspace is much smaller than for Petri nets with the same prop-\nerties and complexity. For the demonstration of the SPENAT\nbased test generation method, an academic implementation was\nused. Table I presents some statistic data of the CPN model\nand SPENAT model.\nWe can see that testing with CPNs has the challenge of\nstate space explosion problem. For example, when we shift\nthe considering scenario from STANDBY, RUNNING, and\nEMERGENCY STOP to STANDBY, BAN OF ENTRY,\nCONDITIONAL CONDITIONAL RUNNING, RUNNING,\nand EMERGENCY STOP, the nodes of the reachability\ngraph will grow from 39 to 66, and the paths of the reachability\ngraph from 8 to 24. Testing with SPENAT could establish a\nmodel with less places and transitions. when the test object is\nsimple enough, in this case few scenarios are under considera-\ntion, the number of test cases generated by both approaches are\nclosed. However if the test object is much more sophisticated,\ne.g. more scenarios are de?ned in this case, then huge number\nof test cases will generated by the CPN based approach while\nthe number of test cases generated with SPENAT approach is\nin a reasonable scope. Nevertheless, the CPN based approach\nhas the advantage of saving the effort of constructing the test\nenvironment.\nIn conclusion, both CPNs and SPENAT are high-level Petri\nnets, and their state spaces are represented by reachability\ngraph and \(complete respec-\nTABLE I.

nThe client process contained a loop that dispatched a task to \nthe manager for each month. The GRE manager used round \nrobin task placement to place each mean calculation on a single \nnode, and wrapped around the available resources. Our \nperformance metrics involved an average between five timings \nof the execution of the entire yearly workload from the client \nusing the Unix time command. \nFig. 7 represents the scaling of the GRE system on the \nannual mean benchmark for up to 9 compute nodes. The x-\naxis is the number of nodes performing the concurrent \nexecution of the benchmark, and the y-axis is the total \nworkload runtime in seconds. The ideal curve demonstrates \nperfectly linear scaling. Our measurements show very good \nscaling which is expected due to the simple parallelism \n2163\ninherent in the data and computational layout. However our \nmeasurements show performance flattens out after five nodes, \nthis is due to bandwidth saturation for NFS.

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
