Fig.1 Time series Subsequence Partition of Time Series based on Different Width Time Window  Hongwei Guo, Jianliang Zhang, Yanchi Liu, Xuedong Gao University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083 ghwvip@gmail.com  Abstract Focusing on the limitation of traditional methods that the subsequences of time series are divided by the same width time window, an improved event series generation algorithm is proposed. Based on the improved event series generation algorithm, a new approach that divides the time series with different width time window is 
put forward. An example of time series division with different width time window is also presented in the paper Keywords-Data Mining; Time Series; Time Window; Event Series I  INTRODUCTION Subsequences partition based on time window is a basic step of time series data mining \(e.g. forecasting decision tree mining, association rules mining\, and the partition results directly affect the mining result  Up to now, methods for subsequences partition are mainly focusing on dividing subsequences from the time series by the same width time window  
In our paper, a new approach that divides the time series with different width time window is put forward Firstly, the limitation of subsequence partition with the same width time window is analyzed. And several partition algorithms of time series are introduced. Then, an improved event series generation algorithm is proposed and a subsequence partition algorithm by different width time window is put forward base on the event series generated. Also, the proposed algorithm is tested by the data from Shanghai Stock Market II  LIMITATION OF SUBSEQUENCES PARTITION BY THE SAME WIDTH TIME WINDOW Suppose  
    2 1 N x x x s 000  is a time series and subsequence      1 1     w i i i i x x x s 000 is acquired by dividing s  by the same width time window with length w Do the single-step slippage on s from the start point 
to end point, so we can get a series of subsequences 1 2 1      w N s s s 000  all with the width w which are noted as   1  2  1          w N i s w s w i 000  1 000\003 Fig.1 shows that the subsequence series A and series B have a high similarity. However, it is impossible to get A 
and B at the same time according to traditional methods of subsequences partition by the same width time window because the width of the time widow of A is 6 while that of B is 5 After the above analysis, we can see the limitations of subsequences partition by the same width time window are 1\There is a great deal of duplicated information which will result in redundancy, or if the subsequences are not duplicated, they may miss crucial information points; \(2 is not allowed to contract the shape of subsequences series on the time axis III  SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS OF TIME SERIES To describe the character model of the time series is 
the first thing to be solved when executing time series data mining and the event points selection is an important method for such description. The result of event points selection will decide the shape of characters mode of the time series, and finally affect the data mining results 1   All partition algorithms need a measure method to identify how to do the partition calculation. Up to now three measure methods base on fitting errors are mainly used: accumulative residual AE mean residual M E and maximum residual 
DE respectively   There are mainly three kinds of methods for partition of time series base on errors: \(1\liding Window method to increase the segments till the accumulative residual reaches the preset threshold  2\Top-Down method: to repeat the dichotomy of the time series till the fitting error reaches the preset threshold  3\Bottom-Up method Beginning at the maximum segment \(it is also the highest fitting one\ combine the neighbored segments one by one till the fitting error reaches the preset threshold

Among them, the Sliding Window method is the simplest, most direct, and its computation complexity is least as O\(Ln where n is the length of the series, and L is the average distance of the adjacent event points. However the correctness of this method is low, because it only cares about the minimum error of local parts of the time series but neglects the changing characters of the global ones  The Top-Down method pays attention to the global partition errors of the series, so it has a better partition result than the Sliding Window method. However, its computation complexity is higher as   2 K n O where k is the partition number L n K   Besides, it needs more parameters including the global partition error threshold the expected partition number and the error threshold of each part. The Bottom-Up method focuses not only on the fitting error after subsequences combination, but also on the partition characters by selecting the minimum combination cost, so it has a better partition performance than the pervious method. What more, it needs a less computation complexity as   Ln O However, this method also bases on the least squares algorithm which is time consuming, and it needs to preset the error threshold of combination, expected ev ent point number after combination and so on The algorithms mentioned above all use the error threshold to deal with the time series. However, as the time series have different linearity, the partition result may not be satisfied according to the time trend. Here are two main limitations: \(1\artition algorithms based on the accumulative residual can not effectively identify the large trend change of a short time; \(2\artition algorithms based on the mean errors may be weak to identify the inflection point of a time series which have been fitted well for a long time IV  SUBSEQUENCES PARTITION BY DIFFERENT WIDTH TIME WINDOW A  Improved Event Series Generation Algorithm Definition event series is a series, which can approximate represents the original time series, by selecting the crucial position points of the time series N j g g g s N j 002 002  1       1 000 000 represents a time series, where N is the length of s     j j y j g   j y is the observation value of the series at time j   s represents a event series, and M i G G G s s M i 002 002  000 1       1  000 000  where i G is the i th crucial point of the event series  s  and the j th point of the time series s and it is described as    j i y j G  Define s G i  and v G i   as the time of the event series corresponding to the time series and the observation value of the time series, meaning j s G i    j i y v G    Till now, all of the partition algorithms have their own shortages in presenting the trend of the time series. Among them, the Bottom-Up method performs best according to the literatures, so in our paper, the improved Bottom-Up partition method is proposed. The procedure is as follows Step 1: Time series are firstly reduced by triangle reduction method. The points after reduction are the candidates of the event series      i i y x represents the i th point of the time series , where N i 002 002 1  i y is the observation value of v. The adjacent three points can form a triangle as shown in Fig.2. If they satisfy formula \(2 where    j i Dist is used to measure the Euclidean distance between i and j and 1 003 is the reduction threshold, then i is not the crucial point and should be reduced  1  1  1   1     1  003        i i Dist i i Dist i i Dist 2 2   2          j i j i y y x x j i Dist     3 Step 2: Use DE instead of A E  base on Bottom_Up partition method to generate event series. Firstly, select the event points from the set of candidates, and link them on by on, so to get segments. Secondly, combine the segments calculate each maximum error of segments after combination, and select the minimum error among them. If such value is less than 2 003 then reduce the middle point of the segments, repeat the above process till the minimum error is larger than 2 003 Finally, the left points are the event points Figures below show the process of event series generation. Fig.3 is the original time series. Firstly, the candidate set of event series are acquired by the triangle reduction method as shown in Fig.4. Secondly, the improved Bottom-Up method is adopted and then the event series are generated, which is shown as Fig.5 B  Subsequences generation To partition the event series  s by subsequences generation method, we can get the subsequence of time series by the different width time window, represented by collection   s  V i S S S s V i 002 002  1       1   000 000 where i S  represents the i th subsequence V is the number of subsequence of the time series te i ts G G G S te i ts i 002 002        000 000 and      i i y x     1  1   i i y x      1  1   i i y x  Fig.2 Triangle Relation between the adjacent three points

Firstly, the improved event series generation algorithm was used to acquire event series from the time series. Secondly, the subsequences generation algorithm was adopted based on the partition method with different width time window Finally, the 24 crucial points of event series were acquired as shown in Fig.6 Set the width of the different time window w to 40 and use the single-step slipping method to divide the time series. 21 subsequences can be generated, which is far less than the 211 subsequences acquired by traditional partition method.

99Wen inside 11 3 99Thu inside 10 4 99Fri inside 6 3 Firstly a format conversion module converts the original alerts to the normalized ones, which take source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol type, alert classification, and attack type as mining attributes. We use the normalized alerts as the input. The implementation is based on the java platform. Threshold values are configured as min_sup = 0.01 and min_conf =0.1 Table III shows the mining association results. The algorithm generates some useful association rules. The first two column are as same as table 1.The third column points out the number of the strong association rules of the alerts and the forth column denotes the number of the attack type of the alerts. For example, on Wednesday, there are 3 kinds of attack types and the total number of strong association rules is 11  Experimental results denote the analysis of data sets in the third week. Only 0.4% alerts are mined as strong association rules, which include "CHAT IRC message Potential Corporate Privacy Violation" originated by attacking the port 6667 of address 192.168.1.20 frequently The rule "INFO TELNET access also shows that telnet service on IP address 172.16.112.50 is frequently accessed  There is an important rule named "SNMP public access udp" which denotes 635 duplicated alerts on Thursday, since IP 192.168.1.30 sends data packets to port 161 on IP 172.16.112.100 through port 32775 every 1 ~ 2 minutes Obviously, the algorithm is useful to reduce the duplicated alerts and help the administrator improving the efficiency The inside network dataset of Darpa2000 is also used. In the dataset, there is an attack chain composed of five stages Four of the five stages are denoted correspondingly by the alerts "RPC portmap sadmind request UDP", "Decode of an RPC Query", "RPC sadmind query with root credentials attempt UDP", "RPC port map Solaris sadmin port query udp portmapper sadmin port query attempt". The algorithm successfully mined all the four rules, which show the full intension of the attacker. The attacker starts from 202.77.162.213 attempting to find the host with "RPC sadmind" vulnerability. Then, he sends a decoding of RPC requests. After that, he launches an exploit to obtain administrator privileges. Finally, he calls rsh to get a remote Shell. This result demonstrates that the algorithm may help the administrator finding out the intension of the attacker IV   C ONCLUSION  The iterative self-join operations used in traditional algorithms include many duplicated and unnecessary scans which result in the low performance. The paper proposes an improved way which removes the iteration procedure and uses one intersection operation to generate maximal frequent itemsets. Experiments demonstrate that the improved one can quickly generate some strong association rules. These rules may denote the targets of the attacks and the intention of the attackers so that they may help the administrator to find out valuable information By now, the improved algorithm mines association rules with IDS alerts not with alert attributes, so it may not be extended to broad excavation. The time attribute of the alerts are not considered yet. In future work, alert attributes are to be involved in the association rules which help constructing the attack scenarios in the form of IDMEF [10   R EFERENCE  1 H u K a n X i a S h ao 2w e i D a ta m i n i ng  bas e d o n l a r g e da ta w a r e 2ho us e   survey [J  J o ur nal o f S o f t w a r e 19 98  9 1   5 3 2 6 2   2 Ba y a rd o E f fic i ent l y M i ni n g L o n g Pat t e rn s from Da ta ba s e s  I n Proc  Of 1998 ACM-SIGMOD Intl.conf.on Management of Data, pages 85-93,Seattle,WA,June 1998 3 J  Z a k i  an d M Orih a r a  T h eoret i c a l foun da ti on s of a s s o c i a t i on ru les   In Proc.

   for overlooking the overall software development process and playing a crucial role in making important decisions  5.1.3. The Criterion Set As stated earlier, criterion is the attribute for which favorability of an alternativ e is calculated. The criterion set defined for this case study comprises of Reusability  Meeting Operational Requirements and Meeting Project Deadline By reusability, we mean, the amount of reuse of different functionalities that ca n be achieved from the previously developed system on Mine detection training tool. Meeting operational requirements implies how effectively a desired operational capability can be satisfied by an alternative. For example, some alternative might lack a certain operational capability like database support whereas another may support it with enhanced features. Meeting project deadline stresses on the fact whether the project requirements can be satisfactorily achieved within the stipulated deadline which in our case was around one year  5.1.4. The Alternatives To resolve the concerned issu e, the stakeholders decided to choose one software platfor m for developing the mine detection training tool among the three stated alternatives Adobe Director  Adobe Flash  Open GL were chosen as the three possible alternatives along with some justifications. Adobe Flash was chosen as one of the alternatives because; the stakeholders already had a previous developed system for mine detection developed using Adobe Flash    Figure 6. Mine Detection System Along With Three Alternatives One of the considerations involved here was to enhance this system rather than develop a new system from scratch. Same reason applied to choosing Adobe Director as one of the other alternatives. Open GL was picked up as one of the three alternatives in the case when a new development had to be started Open GL is an advanced software development platform and it could have served as a good platform for the mine detection training system  Figure 6 summarizes the pro ject and its three alternatives positions available  5.2. Prioritizing The Criteria  For an effective decision making, we had to weigh the criteria according to their im portance in the decision making process. For this, we choose Analytic Hierarchy process because of its effectiveness in performing pair wise comparison of elements .Table 2 shows the ranking table used for comparing the two criteria  Table 2. Criteria Comp arison Table For AHP  Value a ij  Comparison Description 1 Criteria i and j are of equal importance 3 Criteria i is weakly more important than j 5 Criteria i is strongly more important than j 7 Criteria i is very strongly more important than j 9 Criteria i is absolutely more important than j   Table 3.

These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels A, B, C for alternative Adobe flash, Adobe Director and Open GL respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholders priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnt create sound clips  A5.1 We dont need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIs   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
