Introduction\nIn recent years it was realized that designing wireless\ndigital communication systems that efficiently exploit\nthe spatial domain of the transmission medium allows\na significant increase of spectral efficiency. This can be\nachieved using Multiple Input Multiple Output \(MIMO    transmitter and receiver sides. An increasingly\nimportant research topic is the study of multi-user \(MU systems, because such systems have the potential\nto combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO\nprocessing with the benefits of space division multiple\naccess [9]. This allows the transmission of multiple\n1978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE\nspatially multiplexed data streams to multiple users\nwhich results in very high data rates.\nIn MU-MIMO operations, two or more users share\nthe same time-frequency resources, and several parallel\ndata streams can be simultaneously transmitted, one\nfor each user. In the downlink \(DL simultaneous users, every user\nis exposed to inter–user interference, generated by the\nsignals transmitted to the other users [6].\nTo overcome the problem of the multiple access interfer-\nence \(MAI employ multiple–user detec-\ntion \(MUD  too costly to use at the receivers.\nIdeally it would be better to mitigate the MAI at the\ntransmitter side by properly designing the transmitted\nsignals. The transmitter is aware of what interference\nis being created for the users thanks to the received\nfeedback about channel status or quality information.\nSo, the inter–user interference can be mitigated by pre–\ncoding the signals that have to be transmitted.\nThis paper proposes an online pre–coding algorithm [23],\n[24] able to mitigate the multi–user interference of the\nMU-MIMO systems in the context of a realistic WiMAX\napplication scenario. The implemented pre–coding tech-\nnique is a generalization of the channel inversion for\nmulti–user systems, denoted as Block Diagonalization\n\(BD Simulation results clearly evidence the benefit\nachieved by the proposed pre–coding technique in terms\nof increased capacity that can significantly approach\nthe theoretical Shannon limit even in the presence of\nimperfect knowledge of Channel State Information. The\npaper addresses also some fundamental issues about the\nhardware implementation of the proposed zero–forcing\npre–coder, suggesting some feasible solutions based on\nFPGA.\n2. Perspectives in Multi User-MIMO\nMU-MIMO is expected to be a key improvement in 4G\ntechnologies such as the 802.16m WiMAX [1] and Long\nTerm Evolution \(LTE  introduced such a working modality. LTE–\nAdvanced has for example two different Transmission\nModes \(TM TM5 and TM9, that can be used for\nMU-MIMO operations. Nevertheless, the possibilities\noffered by the standards are limited by the technical\n1\nchoices made. Both the 4G candidates are considering\nMU-MIMO based on pre–defined codebooks. Despite\nthe usage of multiple codebooks, selected according to\nthe CSI/CQI perceived by the mobile terminals, this\ndesign choice is extremely suboptimal. The two main\nsub-optimality reasons rely first in the limited adapta-\ntion possibilities offered by codebook–based pre–coders,\nand secondly, in the quantization errors introduced by\nthe type of CQI foreseen.\nSome progresses in the direction of advanced receivers\nhave been anyway made in the literature by several\nresearch projects, such as the SAMURAI project 


3],\nthat investigated the possibility of using an Interference-\naware receiver in combination with standard Long Term\nEvolution \(LTE  MU-MIMO\npre–coding schemes, depending on which kind of algo-\nrithms are employed. The nonlinear schemes have been\nmainly inspired by Dirty Paper Coding [11], whereas\nthe linear schemes are based on typical linear processing\nprinciples such as beamforming or zero-forcing filtering\n[12]. In such a framework a couple of recent works should\nbe mentioned. In [23] an efficient multi-user MIMO uni-\ntary pre–coding scheme is shown based on a codebook\nmaximizing the minimum coding distance and partial\nchannel state information. In [24 linear pre–coding and\nnon-linear Tomlinson–Harashima pre–coding \(THP OFDM system with\nfrequency offsets. It is known that frequency offsets\nnegatively impact MIMO OFDM system performance.\nIn [24] it is demonstrated that frequency offsets do not\nimpact users’ pre–coding individually and hence pre–\ncoding on per–subcarrier basis is possible. Our work\nfollows the line of [23] and [24] as it is targeted at\nassessing performance of MIMO pre–coding in multi-user\nscenarios of technical interest.\nIn this paper we investigate the usage of an interference–\nbased online pre–coding algorithm within the WiMAX\nframework, and its implementation feasibility on a pos-\nsible Software Defined Radio–based platform. The main\ngoal is to start quantifying the potential benefits that\nthe additional complexity required by the proposed pre–\ncoder can bring, in order to open the road to potential\nimplementation trade–offs.\n3. Multi user transmission via linear\npre–coding\nIn what follows, an overview of the considered Zero-\nForcing pre–coding algorithm and its BD-based compu-\ntation is presented. The main purpose of this section is\nto provide an understanding on why such technique is\nconsidered an online, interference–based methodology.\nLet us consider a multiuser DL MIMO channel with\nK users and a single base station \(BS the jth receiver has nRj\nantennas. The total number of antennas at all receivers\nis defined to be nR =\n?\nnRj The channel is modeled\nby an nR × nT matrix H so that each of its elements is\nviewed as the transmission coefficient linking one of the\ntransmit antennas with one of the receive antennas.\nLet us consider a MU-MIMO transmission system that\nincludes linear pre–processing performed at the trans-\nmitter. The received signal d at the user side can be\ndefined as\ndˆ = HMd + n \(1 is the nT ×m pre–coding matrix that has to be\ncomputed and n the additive noise.\nThe condition to impose for eliminating the multi-user\ninterferences is the constraint that HiMj = 0 for i 6= j.\nThe computation of the pre–coding matrix M becomes\nthen extremely important [12]. The pre–coding matrix\ncan be then composed by a set of codewords from\nexisting codebooks, as mentioned in Section 2.\nIt is possible to find the optimal pre–coding matrix M\nsuch that all MUI is zero by choosing a pre–coding\nmatrix Mj that lies in the null space of the other\nusers’ channel matrices. In order to achieve such a\ngoal, the channel matrix of each user, or its estimation,\nis needed. For this reason, this type of algorithm\nis considered online and interference–based because\nit requires knowledge about the current channel and\ninterference conditions. The analyzed Zero-Forcing ZF channel\nis then decomposed into multiple parallel independent\nSU MIMO channels [13]. The main idea behind the\nmethod relies on the computation of the BD matrix via\na Singular Value Decomposition \(SVD  shows the flowchart of the ZF Algorithm.\nIn the first step the SVD of the H˜j matrix, that\nrepresents the interference channel matrix given the\ntransmission of the j-th user, is computed. If we define\nH˜j as\nH˜j n[\nHT1 · · ·HTj?1HTj+1 · · ·HTK\n]T \(2 nThe SVD of H˜j , whose rank is L˜j , provides:\nH˜j = U˜j?˜j\n[\nV˜j\n\(1 0 3 Hermitan transpose, we choose\nthe last right nT ? L˜j singular vectors V˜j\(0 for the null space of H˜j . The\nequivalent channel of user j after eliminating the MUI is\nidentified as Hj V 0 nT ? L˜j nRj receive antennas. Each of these\nequivalent SU MIMO channels has the same properties\nas a conventional SU MIMO channel.\nIn the second step the SVD is re–computed on the\nproduct Hj V˜ \(0 Flowchart of the Zero-Forcing Pre-coding\nAlgorithm\nHj V˜\n\(0 0 4 rank of the j-th user’s equivalent channel\nmatrix be Lj . The product of the first Lj singular\nvectors V \(1 and V˜\n\(0 maximize the information rate for user j subject to\nthe zero MUI constraint.\nThe operations for each user i.e. the loop in Figure 1,\nare repeated until the condition j < K is valid, where K\nis the number of users.\nFinally, the modulation matrix is defined as:\nM =\n[\nV˜1\n\(0 1 0 1 V˜K\n\(0 1 5 of the columns of M. The\noptimal power loading coefficients in ? are found using\nwaterfilling [14] on the diagonal elements of the singular\nvalues contained in the matrix ? given a pre–defined\ntotal power 


constraint.\n4. Simulations and Results\nCapacity Analysis\nThe ZF algorithm has been evaluated within a state-\nof-art, Simulink–based simulator [15] shown in Figure\n2. Such a model is compliant with the IEEE 801.16–\n2004 OFDM physical layer. The simulator has then been\nextended in order to support multiple users and multiple\nparallel OFDM links.\nSome of the basic features available in the model:\n• Forward Error Correction FEC RS code \(CC specified.\n• OFDM transmission using 192 sub-carriers, 8 pilots,\n256-point FFTs, and a variable cyclic prefix length.\n• A single OFDM symbol length preamble that is used\nas the burst preamble.\n• WiMAX standard framing\n OFDM receiver that includes channel estimation using\nthe inserted preambles.\nThe simulator has been modified extending the capa-\nbilities to four different and independent data stream\nand to four single-antenna users The channel model\nhas been extended as well, from MISO to MIMO. The\nconsidered MIMO model is based on the assumptions\nof un–correlated path. Each path has been modeled as\na SISO Rayleigh Fading Channel, each one with three\ninternal paths. The channel estimation is performed\nover the inserted pilot patterns. This lead to the usage,\nin the algorithm, of a non ideal CSI. Nevertheless, the\nconsidered and feedbacked values have high precision, no\nquantization, and substantially no feedback delay.\nThe Zero Forcing block has been inserted in the trans-\nmitter side as shown in Figure 3.\nThe parameters used for evaluating the performance of\nthe ZF pre–coder can be found in Table 1\nTable 1. Simulation Parameters for the ZF evaluation\nWiMAX Parameters\nChannel Bandwidth 3.5 MHz\nNumber of OFDM symbol per burst 4\nCyclic prefix factor \(G threshold for rate control [4,10,12,19,22,28] from [16]\nChannel Parameters\nMaximum Doppler shift 0.5 Hz\nDelay vector random exponential\nGain vector [0 -5 -10] dB\nIn Figure 4 the results of the capacity analysis performed\non such a numerology are showed. The capacity is\ncomputed based on the Shannon formula but taking into\naccount the Signal to Interference plus Noise ratio that\nkeeps into account the MUI.\n3\nFigure 2. Original Simulink c© model used for simulations.\nFigure 3. Implemented Zero Forcing block insertion within the Simulink c© simulator.\n4\nFigure 4. Estimated capacity of the Zero-Forcing algorithm \(BD Shannon bound and\noptimum capacity\nAs can be seen in Figure 4, the results fully meet\nthe expectations, in fact it is possible to notice that\nthe channel capacity obtained using ZF pre–coder on\na 4 × 4 MIMO channel is almost three times larger\nthan the traditional concept of the Shannon limit, but\nit never exceeds the optimum capacity represented by\nthe product between min\(nT , nR configuration considered in this\npaper, the value of the optimal capacity is four times the\nShannon capacity because there are 4 transmitting and 4\nreceiving antennas. As it has been supposed previously,\nthe capacity of the system never reaches the maximum\nboundary because the pre–coder exploits non-ideal CSI\nto generate the pre–coding matrix.\nIssues in Hardware Implementation\nThe purpose of this section is to discuss the challenges\nthat would be faced by a designer who would like to\nimplement the proposed system using FPGA technology.\nThe main blocks necessary for the Zero-Forcing pre–\ncoding algorithm are the following construction of ma-\ntrices taking vectors as input, extraction of columns from\nmatrices, scalar and matrix multiplications, additions,\ndata storage, and SVD factorization. Apart from the\nSVD factorization block implementing the BD pre–\ncoding algorithm should not raise any particular diffi-\nculty; we therefore focus the remainder of the discussion\non the SVD hardware implementation. The fastest\npath to an SVD implementation could be to use an\nIntellectual Property \(IP requirements. For example,\nthe AccelWare SVD reference design [17] accepts only\nreal-valued square input matrices, but the SVD required\nfor the proposed Zero-Forcing pre–coder must be able to\nfactorize a rectangular complex-valued matrix.\nSurveying the scientific literature dealing with the hard-\nware implementation of the SVD block suggests several\ninteresting approaches; however, the surveyed papers\nare either not sufficiently detailed for being directly\nrepeated, or the specificities of the proposed implemen-\ntations do not fit our requirements. Nevertheless, they\ncan serve as inspiration and we therefore introduce some\nof them in what follows.\nIn [18] a fast converging SVD algorithm is proposed.\nThe algorithm is suitable for MIMO channels with\nshort coherent time and has the following features: low\ntotal computational complexity, fast convergence speed,\nthe ability to be reconfigured for different numbers of\ntransmitter and receiver antennas, and it is insensitive\nto the dynamic range problem, which is suitable for\nhardware implementation. In [19], an architecture for an\nSVD–based channel estimator is proposed. A number of\nsimplifications are suggested for reducing the complexity\nof the estimator sufficiently in order to allow its hardware\nimplementation; the details of the hardware design are\nexplained in [20]. Another practical FPGA implementa-\ntion of SVD is presented in [21]. The paper shows how\na reduction of logic resource usage, while maintaining\ncomputation speed, is possible by wisely selecting the\nSVD algorithm and by efficiently exploiting the FPGA\nprimary 


elements: the paper proposes an architecture\nfor Jacobi SVD and the implementation exploits the\nembedded hardware multipliers and memory blocks of\nthe FPGA. Finally, a master’s thesis [22], presents\nthe design of a co-processor system for accelerating\nthe computations associated with Singular Value Array\nReconciliation Tomography. The proposed co-processor\nsystem is based on SVD factorization, and a hardware\nimplementation design of SVD is detailed.\nThe most interesting implementations in the context of\nour work are the method proposed in [21] \(Jacobi rota-\ntion  QR decomposition algorithm is computationally more\nefficient than the Jacobi method, but on the other hand,\nthe Jacobi method exhibits more inherent parallelism\nand yields the singular values with higher numerical\naccuracy. For the implementation of the proposed BD\npre–coder, the numerical accuracy of the singular values\nis a very important parameter, but at the same time,\nthe computational efficiency has to be considered. The\ntwo methods also differ in the way the main operations\nare implemented. The method based on the Jacobi\nrotation employs Look–Up Tables \(LUTs matrices. The rotation pa-\nrameters of the method based on QR decomposition are\nevaluated using CORDIC modules. The LUTs have fixed\ndimensions, so the range of the data values has to be\nchecked carefully; the CORDIC modules do not present\ndimensional problems and provide more accurate results,\nbut on the other hand they require more resources\nand more memory. This a trade-off problem which the\ndesigner should solve by evaluating the constraints and\nrequirements of his application.\nBoth [21] and [22] hardware SVD implementations would\n5\nhave to be modified to implement the proposed BD\npre–coder. The implementation of the SVD using the\nJacobi rotation described in [21] takes as input only\nsquared matrices, whereas in this work the SVD has\nto be applied on rectangular matrices, so the rotation\nmatrices have to be computed in a different way, not\nspecified in the paper. The implementation of SVD\nbased on QR decomposition generates as output only the\nmatrix with the singular values, but to implement the\nBD pre–coder, the matrix with the right singular vectors\nis also required. Furthermore, [22] heavily relies on the\nDSP blocks available in Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA, which\nmight make it difficult to port to another architecture.\nIn this context, the performance/portability trade-off\nshould also be carefully considered.\nDespite the number of possible implementation alterna-\ntives, online pre–coding is still problematic in the imple-\nmentation phase since the number of iterations required,\nsuch as the dimension of the interference channel matrix,\nare increasing linearly with number of multiplexed users.\nThis factor increases the computational latency, which is\nan important factor when dealing with high speed mobile\nsystems, such as WiMAX.\n5. Conclusion\nIn the present paper an online interference–based Multi\nUser–MIMO technique from the literature has been ana-\nlyzed implemented, and evaluated in a WiMAX 802.16–\n2004 compliant simulator in order to verify the effective\nperformance of such technique with the real WiMAX\nnumerology. The selected technique proved to have good\nperformance in terms of capacity when compared to the\ntheoretical Shannon bound. Nevertheless, as showed in\nthe hardware implementability analysis, its complexity is\nstill preventing the system designer to take into account\nthe interference–based techniques for the introduction\ninto standards.\n6.

34. Motivation refers to the Internal and \nexternal factors that stimulate desire and energy to be \nactively involved in social network activities. \nMotivation is categorized into \(i nSDT\(Self-Determination Theory  ii that a user is \nactively involved in. \nThe widely accepted topic detection algorithm is \nLDA\(Latent Dirichlet Allocation   networks, hypergraph [5] \nor multi-mode network [37] is commonly used. However, in \nthese works, only uni-dimensional features of the users, \ncategories, and posts are considered, therefore it dramatically nlimits the breadth and depth of the analytics in social \nnetworks. Based on these considerations, we improve the \nhyper graph model with the capacity of conducting multi-\ndimensional analyses. \nA. Hyper Graph Representation of Social Networks \nBehavior \nBefore we proceed to discuss the hyper graph \nrepresentation social network behaviors, let us first introduce \nthe denotation of the social network behaviors. As discussed nin Section 2, the properties of social network users, \ncategories and tweets are not uni-dimensional, as shown in \nFig. 2a. Suppose the set of vertices in social networks is \nrepresented as V and its three subsets as U = {u1,...,uk}, C = \n{c1,...,cl}, T = {t1,...,tm}, corresponding to the set of users, the \nset of categories/topics marked by hash tag subsets \nare disjoint and possibly empty. Then the dimensions of each \nof three type vertices are denoted as P\(uk uk u cm cm c tl tl PTj3, j3 = 1, ..., |P\(t j3th \ndimension of user type, category type and tweet type vertex. \nThe behavior in social networks is then defined as a \ntripartite graph H\(B u, c, t U×C×T} represents the \nhyperedge. For example, in twitter case, each edge represents \nthe fact that a given user participated in the disseminating of \na tweet marked within a certain category. The dissemination \nways of tweets include DT, RT, and MT.  \nFigure 2.  \(a B u1, u2, u3 t1, t2}, E={{u1, t1, c1}, {u2, t2, c1},{u3, t1, c1}} \n65\nIn Fig. 2b, u1 directly sends a tweet t1 hash tagged c1, \nthen u2 sends t2 under the same category, u3 retweets t1, \nsuppose u3 modified retweet t1, adding another category c2, \nthen hyperedge e4 should be added.  \nB. Multi-faceted Behavior based Analytics \nThe tripartite graphs and hyperedges can be reduced to \nthree bipartite graphs with regular edges. These three graphs \nmodel the associations between users and categories \(graph \nUC graph CT n\(graph UT u, c u, c t u, c e u,c,tk u, c, tk graph into its one-\nmode networks can be easily obtained through the matrix O \n= {oij}, oij = f\(u,c,tk bipartite graph [5]. In the uni-\ndimensional fashion, oij = 1 indicates user ui disseminates a \ntweet marked with category cj. In the multi-dimensional \nfashion, suppose sentiment is also under consideration, oij navg\(s\(tk k = 1, .. ,K with category \ncj that user ui disseminates. The co-a?liation matrix P = \nOO’= {pij}, where pij = ?oixoxj x=1, ..k matrix describes the relations \nbetween two users who have both participated in \ndisseminating tweets within the same category, with the \nsentiments in the posts considered simultaneously. While in \nthe matrix without considering sentiment, the links are \nbetween people who have used the same categories with \nweights showing the number of categories they have used in \ncommon. Here, these are also weighted by the sentiments. In \nthe general notation, oij = avg\(?pj3\(tk one-mode \nnetwork matrices indicates the counts of how many \ncategories a given user was a?liated with in the bipartite \ngraph; in multi-dimensional conditions, the diagonal \nindicates the average sentiments of the user tweets in the \ncategories.

In particular, the CT \ngraph leads to another semantic network, where the links \nbetween categories are weighted by integrating the quantity \nof tweets that are tagged with both terms and the properties \nof the senders of the tweets. The UT graph results in another \nrelation network of persons, where the weight of a pair is \ngiven by integrating the number of tweets they have both \ndisseminated and the properties of the categories of the \ntweets. Two networks of tweets can also be obtained from \nUT and CT. \nIV. CASE STUDY IN TWITTER \nIn this section, we aim to illustrate the applicability of the \nimproved hypergraph model from the perspective of how it \ncould enhance the breadth” of social network analytics by \napplying it to unearth the hidden multi-dimensional \nrelationships 


of the highly active Twitter users. \nA. Data Description \nThe tweets were obtained from January ~ October 2010. \nThe sentiment of the tweets are evaluated based on ANEW \n[20] with emoticons and slangs replaced with the \ncorresponding text. The data used for replacing emoticons \nand slangs are emoticons [38], containing 938\(1341  ANEW only concerns \nEnglish words, non-English users were filtered out by \nconsidering two aspects concurrently: \(i ii the threshold is set at 0.3 for segmenting between \nnon-English and English users nextracted: \(i ii disseminated the posts \n\(both DT and RT After the preprocessing, we \nhave 81 users, 6,711categories and 3, 887, 363 tweets. \nB. Multi-dimensional User Relationship Analytics \nFig. 3 gives a fine grain view of the whole user \nconnections in Twitter as an illustration of multi-faceted user \nrelation analyses. In Fig. 3, the color of the nodes indicates \nthe degree of users, while the edge color indicates the weight \nof edges, in \(a d spread \nin the same category, \(b c d though two users have co-\nused the same category, the connection between them varies \nalong different dimensions. In this way, in addition to simply \nknowing there is a common category-mark behavior between \ntwo users, the properties of this behavior could also be \nunearthed and reflected in the strength of the user nconnections. Thus not only the volume is dramatically \ncompressed through the knowledge extraction, but also the \ncomplexity of big data is dis-entangled in a finer resolution \nfor the analysts and decision makers. \n n\(a b c d A fine grain view of two user connections based on the \ncategories co-used and  \(a co-spread with \(b c d a d Red-\nBlue: Greatest-\nSmallest a d a b n\(c d Red-\nBlue: Greatest-\nSmallest a tweets co-spread, \n\(b c d FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper we present a multi-layered knowledge \nextraction approach of social networks with a comprehensive \nsurvey of relevant notions and techniques from multi-\ndisciplines. Besides, we also improve the hyper graph model \nof social network behaviors based on the dimensions \nproposed in the model with a case study in Twitter \nillustrating the multi-dimensional relations between Twitter \nusers.

[24]\nimplements a OS-level scheduler which places intensively-\ninteracting threads close to each other. As shown in this\npaper, arranging data movement based on cache topology\nalone does not capture all important trade-offs and may lead\nto sub-optimal overall performance.\nContention Aware Mapping.

Hardware [21] and OS level [17]\ncache partitioning, user level thread scheduling [34], and\ncompiler-time transformation [22, 25 are proposed to mit-\nigate resource contention among processes and/or threads.\nHowever, they only work for independent threads or pro-\ncesses with no communication or sharing relationships.\nHolistic Mapping. [26 exploits thread mapping for op-\ntimizing multi-threaded datacenter applications on CMPs.\nHowever, the mapping policies in [26] either use exhaustive\nsearch or require a new algorithm for each type of cache\ntopology. Our new contributions include an in-depth study\nof streaming application’s cache behavior and a holistic\nmapping algorithm which is more general and scalable.\nB. Optimizing Streaming Applications on CMPs\nAlgorithmic Optimization of Streaming Algorithms. Exam-\nples include join [27, 11], aggregation [6], sorting [10 and\nfrequency counting [7]. Operators in a streaming program\nmay interact with each other in complicated ways and\nsuch complexity is manifested at thread level at runtime.\nManaging such complicated interaction is beyond the scope\nof tuning individual operators, so orchastration provided by\nStreamMap is necessary to coordinate threads’ execution.\nBesides, StreamMap does not require knowledge of opera-\ntors’ internal implementation, and uses pro?ling information\ncollected at middleware level to make mapping decisions.\nTherefore, StreamMap is orthogonal and complementary to\ncode tuning of individual streaming operators.\nCompile-Time Scheduling and Mapping of Streaming Pro-\ngrams on CMPs. Pioneered by StreamIt [13], work has\nbeen done in optimizing static scheduling of streaming\nprograms on multicores [16, 29, 30]. Those work apply\ncompiler analysis and code transformation to exploit various\nparallelism in program to balance computation load among\nthreads. Since most of those work target Cell B.E. architec-\n630\nture which has explicitly managed memory hierarchy, they\ncommonly try to hide data movement cost by overlapping\ncommunication with computation in the execution schedule.\nIn comparison, StreamMap targets cache topologies seen in\nx86 CMP architecture which impose distinct challenges such\nas contention on shared resources, and it works at thread\nlevel without heroic compiler analysis.\nCache-Aware Optimization of Streaming Programs. [23]\nproposed three techniques to optimize StreamIt programs\non a uniprocessor: execution scaling, buffer manager, and\nregister replacement. [20] extends execution scaling to multi-\ncore. Both work assumes synchronous data ?ow model to\ncalculate static steady state schedule, and [20] does not\nconsider thread mapping to reduce contention or thread\nsynchronization cost 4] theoretically shows that cache-\nef?cient scheduling of streaming programs on a uniprocessor\ncan be modeled as a partitioning problem and some special\ncases can be solved in polynomial time. Our work targets\nmulti-core processors, uses mapping algorithms different\nfrom the one proposed in [4], implements those algorithms\ninside System S middleware, and evaluates them with real-\nworld applications on representative architectures.\nVII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper demonstrates that CMP’s cache topology can\nhave a signi?cant impact on the performance of multi-\nthreaded streaming applications. Our StreamMap approach\nautomatically places threads 


to cores to control the data\nsharing and resource contention between threads, and can\nimprove real-world streaming applications’ performance by\nup to 1.8 times over the default Linux OS scheduler.\nFuture directions of this research are twofold. We plan to\nstudy how to use StreamMap to provide feedback informa-\ntion to System S’ compiler to optimize operator fusion. We\nalso plan to apply StreamMap to a wider range of streaming\napplications, e.g., dynamic graph analysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dynamorio: Dynamic instrumentation tool platform.\nhttp://www.dynamorio.org, October 2012.\n[2] Likwid: Lightweight performance tools.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/likwid, October 2012.\n[3] Scotch: Static mapping, graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning.\nhttp://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/, October 2012.\n[4] K.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control. Emerging challenge now is to make the revolutionary prosthetics, practi-\ncal affordable and available for amputees today.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
