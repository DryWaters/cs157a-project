6 Conclusions We presented MAFIA an algorithm for finding maximal frequent itemsets Our experimental results demonstrate that MAFIA consistently outperforms Depthproject by a factor of three to five on average The breakdown of the algorithmic components showed parent-equivalence pruning and dynamic reordering were quite beneficial in reducing the search space while relative compressiodprojection of the vertical bitmaps dramatically cuts the cost of counting supports of itemsets and increases the vertical scalability of MAFIA Acknowledgements We thank Ramesh Agarwal and Charu Aggarwal for discussing Depthproject and giving us advise on its implementation We also thank Jayant R Haritsa for his insightful comments on the MAFIA algorithm and Jiawei Han for providing us the executable of the FP-Tree algorithm This research was partly supported by an IBM Faculty Development Award and by a grant from Microsoft Research References I R Agarwal C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad A Tree Projection Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Itemsets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing special issue on high performance data mining to appear 2000 2 R Agrawal T Imielinski and R Srikant Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases SIGMOD May 1993  R Agrawal R Srikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc of the 20th Int Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile, Sept 1994  R Agrawal H Mannila R Srikant H Toivonen and A 1 Verkamo Fast Discovery of Association Rules Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Chapter 12 AAAVMIT Press 1995 5 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Mining Large Itemsets for Association Rules Data Engineering Bulletin 21 1 23-31 1 998 6 C C Aggarwal P S Yu Online Generation of Association Rules.
