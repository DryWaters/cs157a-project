In order to achieve\nhighly-available yet high-performing services, cloud data stores\nrely on data replication. However providing replication brings\nwith it the issue of consistency. Given that data are replicated in\nmultiple geo-graphically distributed data centers, and to meet\nthe increasing requirements of distributed applications many\ncloud data stores adopt eventual consistency and therefore allow\nto run data intensive operations under low latency. This comes\nat the cost of data staleness. In this paper, we prioritize data\nreplication based on a set of ?exible data semantics that can\nbest suit all types of Big Data applications, avoiding overloading\nboth network and systems during large periods of disconnection\nor partitions in the network Therefore we integrated these data\nsemantics into the core architecture of a well-known NoSQL\ndata store e.g., HBase i.e., regarding timeliness, number of pending\nupdates and divergence bounds This enhances the former\nconsistency model by providing a number of required levels of\nconsistency to different applications such as, social networks or e-\ncommerce sites, where priority of updates also differ In addition,\nour implementation of the model into HBase allows updates to\nbe tagged and grouped atomically in logical batches, akin to\ntransactions, ensuring atomic changes and correctness of updates\nas they are propagated.\nKeywords-Geo-replication; HBase; NoSQL; YCSB;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn distributed systems in general and Cloud Computing\nspeci?cally, data replication is becoming a major challenge\nwith large amounts of information requiring consistency and\nhigh availability as well as resilience to failures. There have\nbeen several solutions to that problem, none of them applicable\nin every case, as they all depend of the type of system and\nits end goals. As the CAP theorem states [1], one can not\nensure the three properties of a distributed system all at once,\ntherefore applications usually need to compromise and choose\ntwo out of three between consistency, availability and tolerance\nto partitions in the network.\nNowadays, in many data center environments is key to\nunderstand how one makes such distributed systems scalable\nwhile still delivering good performance to applications. Data\navailability is for instance always a desired property, while a\nsuf?ciently strict level of consistency should be used to handle\ndata effectively across locations without long network delays\n\(latency are analyzed to provide operations with faster \(eventual stronger compromising perfor-\nmance [2]. In some, causal serialization and therefore commu-\ntative updates are provided also based on data semantics, but\nrequire redesigning application data types [3] or intercepting\nand re?ecting APIs via middleware [4]. Unlike linearizability,\neventual consistency does work well for systems with shared\ndistributed data to be queried and/or updated, because updates\ncan be performed on any replicas at any given time [5].\nIt is then easier to achieve lower latency, so most systems\nimplement eventual consistency in order to avoid expensive\nsynchronous operations across wide area networks and still\nkeeping data consistent through low latency operations in large\ngeo-located deployments.\nHBase is a well-known and deployed open source cloud data\nstore written and inspired on the idea of BigTable [6] which\ntargets the management of large amounts of information.\nHBase does not provide strong consistency outside of the local\ncluster itself Eventuality is the promise and a write-ahead log\nmaintained for that.\nThis work introduces HBase-QoD, a replication module that\nintegrates into HBase mechanisms targeting applications which\nmight also require ner-grain levels of consistency. Other\nsystems use a variant of Snapshot Isolation techniques [7],\nwhich works within, but not across data centers. Others, like\nthe conit model, are based on generality but not practicality [8].\nWe ?nd the later to be more rewarding to users in terms\nof quality of data within a fully functional and reliable data\nstorage system, achieving optimization of resources during\ngeo-replication and consequently signi?cant cost savings. We\npropose an architecture with custom levels of consistency,\nproviding ner-grain replication guarantees through data se-\nmantics. Application behavior can be therefore turn into a\nkey and more ef?cient shift into the consistency paradigm.\nThis is re?ected in this paper by modifying and extending\neventual consistency, with an innovative approach used to tune\nits replication mechanisms originally developed for treating all\nupdates equally.\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science\n978-0-7695-5095-4/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2013.29\n164\nA Contributions\nThe main contributions are focused on what other consis-\ntency properties HBase can provide 


between different geo-\nlocated clusters at the replication level, that is, using a ?exible\nand tunable framework, developed for treating groups of\nupdates tagged for replication in a self-contained manner The\nwork presented includes the design and development of the\nmodel to be applied to non-relational cloud-based data stores.\nWe take a step forward from the eventual consistency model\nat inter-site replication scenarios with HBase deployments to\nprove the validity of the model. It is possible to evaluate it by\nusing an adaptive consistency model that can provide different\nlevels of consistency depending of the desired Service Level\nObjective \(SLO QoD percentage of\nupdates that need to be replicated within a given period using\na three-dimensional vector model K.\nWe also propose to extend HBase client libraries in order to\nprovide grouping of operations during replication, where each\nof the groups can provide the level of consistency required:\nANY, IMMEDIATE, or even with a speci?c custom bound.\nTo achieve this we modify HBase libraries \(Htable from the source location before replica-\ntion actually occurs, so apart from the multi-row atomically\nde?ned model in HBase, a more versatile system can also\nprovide atomically replicated updates beyond the row-level\n\(e.g., column families or combinations of the ?elds in a row\nin HBase contribution that we\naim to turn into a formal one to complete the efforts of a\n"pluggable replication framework" as proposed by the Apache\nHBase community. 1\nB. Roadmap\nIn the next sections of the paper we have a brief overview\nof fundamental consistency models and background work\nin this area of distributed systems having special focus on\nthe concept of eventual versus strong consistency and what\npossible variations of the two can exist in the middle of the\nspectrum. As intermediate approach, we devise HBase-QoD,\na HBase extension to apply QoD de?ned through a three-\ndimensional vector-?eld model inspired on [9]. Data semantics\nare de?ned and enforced with a vector K paper is organized as follows, related work in\nSection 2, our HBase extension architecture in Section 3 the\nimplementation details in Section 4, and evaluation in Section\n5. The evaluation results show that from the architectural point\nof view our solution integrates well in HBase and provides the\ncorresponding vector-bounded replication guarantees. Finally,\nwith Section 6 we conclude this work.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nHBase is open source, and its architecture is based in pre-\nvious work at Google, BigTable [10 a distributed, persistent\n1Priority queue sorted replication policy, A. Purtell, August, 2011.\nand multi-dimensional sorted map. HBase is being used for\ninstance at Facebook data-centers for structured storage of the\nmessaging and user data in partial replacement of Cassan-\ndra [11]. Cassandra offers replica-set consistency tuning, but\nnot divergence bounded consistency regarding data semantics.\nIn geo-located and replicated remote clusters, the system\nprovides eventual guarantees to data consistency through RPC\n\(Remote Procedure Call applications require stronger consistency\nguarantees and can be dif?cult to manage. Due to that, there\nhave been recent research efforts to address these shortcomings\nin geo-replicated data centers, with Google developing earlier\nin 2012 an evolution of BigTable that provides external consis-\ntency through atomic clocks for instance, Spanner [12]. This\nmakes applications highly-available while ensuring as much\nsynchronicity among distant replicas as possible and more\nimportantly, atomic schema changes. Data locality is also an\nimportant feature for partitioning of data across multiple sites.\nSpanner does use Paxos for strong guarantees on replicas.\nStrong consistency does not work well for systems where\nwe need to achieve low latency. So the reason for most systems\nto use eventual consistency is mostly to avoid expensive\nsynchronous operations across wide area networks. In other\ncases such as COPS [13] causality is guaranteed, although it\ndoes not guarantee the quality of data by bounding divergence,\nwhich can still lead to outdated values being read. Previous\ninspiring work from [14] also shows divergence bounding\napproaches to be feasible in that regard.\nSystems such as PNUTS from Yahoo [15], introduced a\nnovel approach for consistency on a per-record basis. There-\nfore, it became possible to provide low latency during heavy\nreplication operations for large web scale applications. As in\nour work, they provide ?ner-grain guarantees for certain data,\nso in other words, new updates are not always seen right\naway by the clients \(which is the case also with our HBase\nextension to be highly-available\nand consistent both at once. That is applicable to our use\ncase. Yahoo made the case for eventual consistency not being\nenough, and as in the case of social networks, stale replicas\ncan introduce privacy issues if not handled adequately. We\npropose using operation grouping to resolve the consistency\nissue among blocks of updates more ef?ciently and in an\nstraight forward manner by using several QoD levels.\nIII HBASE-QOD ARCHITECTURE\nHBase-QoD allows for entries to be evaluated prior to\nreplication, and it is based in the aforementioned vector-\n?eld consistency model, allowing for a combination of one\nor several of the 


parameters in K updates that collide with previous ones \(same keys but\ndifferent values pending\nupdates or value divergence from previously replicated items\n165\nand, if required, shipped or kept on hold accordingly. The\ntime constraint can be always validated every X seconds,\nand the other two through Alg 1 as updates arrive. For\nthe work presented here we use Sequence showcase the model in practice. For\nthis, we de?ne a set of customized data structures, which\nhold the values of database row items due to be checked\nfor replication on a particular data container. Containers are\nidenti?ed as tableName:columnFamily for us, and can also be a\ncombination of relevant row-?elds from the data store schema\nwith the purpose of differentiating data and apply semantics\nonto it.\nIn order to track and compare QoD ?elds \(which act as\nconstraints during replication de?ned for the purpose, controlling both current\nand maximum \(then reset QoD\npercentage is on the updates due to be propagated at once\n\(e.g., using automated at the moment,\nwith us just de?ning it at run-time \(or by the developer later into the HBase console that selects the\ndesired vector-?eld bound percentage.\nExtensions to the HBase internal mechanisms: A high-\nlevel view of the mechanisms introduced with HBase-QoD is\noutlined in Figure 1, and it is based in each case in an speci?c\nQoD bound applied to each de?ned data container per user.\nReplicating when the QoD is reached means in the case of\nQoD-1, sending ? updates, 3, from User A \(assume is not\nsame data-container value time, reset back to zero if reached eld, in\nthis case also showing the last-writer wins behavior on the\nremote side, user N, for a same propagating remote data-\ncontainer value during replication. This overall architecture\nlayout is presented in order to showcase a scenario where to\nrule updates selectively during geo-replication.\nThe original HBase architecture has built-in properties de-\nrived from the underlying HDFS layer. As part of it, the\nWALEdit data structure is used to store data temporarily\nbefore being replicated, useful to copy data between several\nHBase locations. The QoD algorithm \(shown in Algorithm. 1 contain\nmore meaningful information that help us in the management\nof the outgoing updates marked for replication. We extend\nHBase, handling updates due to be replicated in a priority\nqueue according to the QoD speci?ed for each of their data\ncontainers. Thereafter once the speci?ed QoD threshold is\nreached the working thread in HBase, in the form of Remote\nProcedure Call, collects and ships all of them at once.\nTypical distributed and replicated deployment: In dis-\ntributed clusters Facebook is currently using HBase to manage\nthe messaging information across data centers. That is because\nof the simplicity of consistency model as well as the ability\nof HBase to handle both a short set of volatile data and ever-\ngrowing data, that rarely gets accessed more than once.\nWith the eventual consistency enforcement provided, up-\ndates and insertions are propagated asynchronously between\nSite A Site B\nInter-Cluster \nReplication\nUser A \nUser N\nQoD N...QoD 2 updates replicated\nUpdates Replicated\nin HBase\nUser D\nQoD-1. ?=3 for column family c0. \nWe increase value of ? up to 3 and replicate \nall items from c0 at that point.\nkey: user1221, columnId: c0, ...\nQoD-1\nkey user1221, columnId: c0 ?=1\n?=2\n?=3\n?=0\nkey: user1221, columnId: c0, ...\nkey: user1221, columnId: c0, ...\nkey user1221, columnId: c0\nkey: user9231, columnId: c2, val:1\nkey: user8911, columnId: c2 ? =1\nQoD-2. ?=1 for column family c2.\nIn this case ? is a time constant, so each \nsecond it replicates all items from c2 .\n? =1\n 1\n? =0\nkey: user9231, columnId: c2, val:0\nkey: user9231, columnId: c2, val:1\nkey: user8911, columnId: c2 nkey: user1221, columnId: c0 \nkey: user1221, columnId: c0 \nkey: user1221, columnId: c1 \nFigure 1: HBase QoD high-level\nclusters so Zookeeper is used for storing their positions in\nlog ?les that hold the next log entry to be shipped in HBase.\nTo ensure cyclic replication \(master to master back to the source, a sink location\nwith remote procedure calls invoked is already into place with\nHBase Therefore if we can control the edits to be shipped,\nwe can also decide what is replicated, when or in other words,\nhow soon or often.\nAlgorithm 1 QoD algorithm for selecting updates using ?\ncriteria \(with time and value would be the same or similar and controlBound = 0\n1: while enforceQoD\(containerId containerId true\n4: else {getactualK\(containerId     then\n7: actualK Grouping: At the application level, it may be\nuseful for HBase clients to enforce the same consistency level\non groups of operations despite affected data containers having\n166\ndifferent QoD bounds associated. In other words, there may be\nspeci?c situations where write operations need to be grouped\nso that they can be all handled at the same consistency level\nand propagated atomically to slave clusters.\nFor example, publication of user statuses in social networks\nis usually handled at eventual consistency, but if they refer to\nnew friends 


being added \(e.g., an update to the data container\nholding the friends of a user a\nstronger consistency level to ensure they are atomically visible\nalong with the list of friends of the user in respect to the\nsemantics we describe here.\nIn order to not violate QoD bounds and maintain consistency\nguarantees, all data containers of operations being grouped\nmust be propagated either immediately after the block exe-\ncution, or when any of the QoD bounds associated to the\noperations has been reached. When a block is triggered for\nreplication, all respective QoD bounds are naturally reset.\nTo enable this behavior we propose extending the HBase\nclient libraries to provide atomically consistent blocks.\nNamely, adding two new methods to HTable class in order\nto delimit the consistency blocks: startConsistentBlock and\nendConsistentBlock. Each block, through the method startCon-\nsistentBlock, can be parameterized with one of the two options:\ni itself; and ii smaller QoD vector-?eld bound, associated\nwith an operation inside the block, is reached.\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nHBase replication mechanism is based in a Write Ahead Log\n\(WAL able to replicate\nbetween distant data centers. The process of replication is\ncurrently carried out asynchronously, so there is no introduced\nlatency in the master server. Although, since that process is not\nstrongly consistent, in write heavy applications a slave could\nstill have stale data for an order of more than just seconds,\nand just until the last updates commit to local disk.\nIn our implementation we overcome the pitfalls of such\nan approach, and propose a QoD-vector to handle selected\nupdates, thus lower values of it e.g maxBound of ? in\nthe three dimensional vector K For write intensive applications, that\ncan be both bene?cial in terms of reducing the maximum\nbandwidth peak-usage, while still delivering data according\nto application needs and with improved semantics.\nThe QoD module in Figure 2 shows the implementation\ndetails introduced with HBase-QoD. We observe the module\nintegrates into the core of the chosen cloud data store \(HBase processing them into a\npriority queue named Uni?ed Cache, which is de?ned to store\nthose for later replication to a given slave cluster.\nChanging the logic of the shipping of edits in the write-\nahead log, this process is therefore performed now according\nto the data semantics we de?ne. Several data structures are\nHRegionServer\nQoD\nWALEdit\nQoD 1\nWALEdit\nQoD N\nWALEdit\nQoD 2\n. . .\nUni?ed Cache\nHLogs \( Write Ahead Logs HDFS existing in HBase, as the WALEdit.\nThat is in order to access different data containers that we\nlater query to determine where and how to apply a given QoD\nat the row level \(e.g. tablename:columnFamily is\nreplicated once we check the conditions shown in Algorithm\n1 are met, and replication is triggered if there is a match for\nany of the vector-constraints \(e.g of those updates to be replicated\naccording to a combination of any the three-dimensional vector\nconstraints not only ?.\nV. SIMULATION AND EVALUATION\nIt has been already veri?ed and presented in other reports\nand projects in the area of Hadoop, that a statically de?ned\nreplication level is in itself a limitation, which therefore\nmust be addressed and more ef?ciently adjusted in order to\nkeep up with the scheduling of tasks That is also related\nto the work here covered within HBase, as HDFS is its\nstorage layer. A workaround on static replication constraints\nin HDFS and HBase is offering and enforcing on-demand\nreplication with HBase-QoD and its vector-?eld model. During\nevaluation of the model, a test-bed of several HBase clusters\nhas been deployed, having some of them using the HBase-QoD\nengine enabled for quality of data between replicas and others\nrunning a regular implementation of HBase 0.94.8. All tests\nwere conducted using 6 machines with an Intel Core i7-2600K\nCPU at 3.40GHz, 11926MB of available RAM memory, and\nHDD 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 32MB cache connected by 1\nGigabit LAN.\nWe con?rm the QoD does not hurt performance as we\nobserve from the throughput achieved for the several levels\nof QoD chosen during the evaluation of the benchmark for\nour modi?ed version with HBase-QoD enabled, Figure 3. The\ndifferences in throughput are irrelevant and mostly due to noise\nin the network, that is the conclusion after obtaining similar\n167\nresults to that one in several rounds of tests with the same\ninput workload on the data store.\nNext we conducted as shown in Figure 4, and dstat presents,\nan experiment to monitor the CPU usage using HBase-QoD.\nCPU consumption and performance remains roughly the same\nand therefore stable in the cluster machines as can be appre-\nciated.\nWe have also taken measurements for the following work-\nloads obtaining results as follows:\nWorkloads for YCSB: We have tested our implementa-\ntion in HBase with several built-in workloads from YCSB\nplus one custom workload with 100% writes to stress the\ndatabase intensively, because target updates in social networks\nas previously mentioned, are mostly all about changes and new\ninsertions.\nFigure 5 shows three different sets of Qualities of Data for\nthe same workload \(A R/W - 50/50

This is\ndue to the nature of eventual consistency itself and the\nbuffering mechanisms in HBase.\nWith a QoD enabled as shown in the other two graphs,\nwe rather control traf?c of updates from being un-\nbounded to a limited size, and accordingly saving re-\nsources’ utilization, while suiting applications that re-\nquire smaller amounts of updates as they only propa-\ngated as a group, when they are just needed.\nWe observe that a higher QoD implies replication traf?c\nless often, although interactions reach high values on\nBytes as they need to send more data.

Note we are not measuring, or ?nd relevant, in\nany of these scenarios, to realize savings on average bandwidth\nusage. The principal source of motivation of the paper is to\n?nd a way of controlling the usage of the resources in a data\ncenter. Also, to be able to leverage the trading of strong for\neventual consistency with a more robust atomic grouping of\noperations using vector bounded data semantics.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nPerformance in HBase improves as the number of resources\nincreases, for instance with more memory available [6], but it\nis not always trivial to scale further following that approach.\nTherefore, having ways of providing different levels of consis-\ntency to users regarding data in cloud environments translates\ninto substantial traf?c savings and potentially associated costs\nto service providers. That is a relevant matter already discussed\nfor consistency cost-ef?ciency [16].\n168\nBandwidth Usage\n 0\n 20000\n 40000\n 60000\n 80000\n 100000\n 120000\n 140000\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600 700\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds 0.5 400  500  600  700\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds 2 250000\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds Workload A with zip?an distribution, using 5M records using QoD bounds of 0.5 and 2% in\nthe ? of K.\nBandwidth Usage\n 0\n 20000\n 40000\n 60000\n 80000\n 100000\n 120000\n 0  50  100  150  200  250\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds HBase QoD K \(, 0.5 250\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds 2 150  200  250\nBy\nte\ns\nTime \(seconds distribution, using 5M records and QoD bounds of 0.5 and 2%\nin the ? of K.\nIn this paper we presented HBase-QoD, a module that\nuses quality-of-data \(QoD geo-replication. The framework allows\nbounds on data to be used in order to perform selective\nreplication in a more controlled and timely-fashion than usual\neventually consistent approaches in these sort of data stores.\nWith the semantics presented we trade-off short timed\nconsistency with wide area bandwidth cost savings during peak\nloads. Achieving the last, can help to signi?cantly reduce repli-\ncation overhead between data centers when there are periods\n169\nof disconnection or bottlenecks in the network. We evaluated\nour implementation on top of HBase clusters distributed across\nseveral locations showing relevant results for that.\nIn summary, a successful model based on vector-?eld di-\nvergence mechanisms [9] was implemented and shows how\nHBase consistency can be tuned at the core-system level,\nwithout requiring intrusion to the data schema and avoiding\nmore middle-ware overhead such as in [17]. In our case,\nexperimental results indicate that we are able to maintain\nan acceptable throughput, reduce latency peaks, as well as\noptimize bandwidth usage In the future we would like to\nconduct more experiments using Amazon EC2 infrastructure\nand also several other cluster locations in partner-universities\nif there is any chance to do so.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by national funds through\nFCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia projects\nPTDC/EIA-EIA/113613/2009, PTDC/EIA-EIA/108963/2008, PEst-\nOE/EEI/LA0021/2013.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Brewer’s

should be displayed at this entity \nlevel. The same holds for external validations, which \nare usually at the level of the environmental report. In \norder not to overstrain the efforts of the users \nproviding quality ratings, the rating should also take \nplace at this level.  \n6.2. Reputation-based Incentive Scheme \nBased on the identification of motives and the \nnature of the environmental content that is required,\n3499501\nthere are a number of features and functionalities that \nthe system should inherit. Designing for enjoyment \nhas been previously defined as key for IT artifacts. In \nparticular, positive experience should be created by a \nuser interface which promotes pleasure, enjoyment, \nand fun in order to enable user satisfaction [40]. The \nsystem should also be easy to use. Community-\nbuilding features and designing for sociability is \nrequired to fulfill the desire of individuals to \nparticipate in communities. E.g. [41] have identified \na number of principles that facilitate sociability in \nsocial software. Comparability within the community \nshould also be enabled in order to facilitate an \nadvantageous competition [37]. There are a number \nof incentives which could be offered based on the \nquantity and quality of contributions: These include \nreduced fees, the incorporation in supplier npurposes. Additionally, the motive to enhance \ncustomer satisfaction can be supported by offering \nsuitable tools for sharing data and communicating \nwith the customer [9]. Reputation is mentioned as an \nimportant motive to stimulate user contributions [35–\n37], so the system should be able to compute a \nreputation score for the participants, and offer \n“badges” or “membership levels” in order to promote \nspecific actions [37 38]. Table 5 summarizes the \nincentives to encourage content contribution. Most \nincentives to join the network are related to a \nconvincing value proposition, thus have to be \nimplemented via comprehensive characteristics and \nfunctionality of the IO-ERIS itself. The goal of the \nincentive system therefore focuses on enhancing user \ncontributions. Based on the considerations presented \nin the previous sections, the reputation mechanism \nshould encourage uploading up-to-date \nEnvironmental Performance Indicators \(EPIs high \nquantity and quality and accurately rating user \ncontributions. Consequently we propose to \ndistinguish a reputation score for contributing EPIs \nand for rating EPIs, and provide additional incentives \nbased on these two scores. \nTable 5. IO-ERIS motives & incentives \nMotive Incentive\nEnjoyment User friendly user interface\nCommunity Community building features\nLow fees Reduce fees based on contributions\nCustomer satisfaction Sharing & communication tools\nReputation Reputation score & badges\nSupplier evaluation nscore\nInclude contributions in supplier \nevaluations\nSophisticated \nfunctionality\nProvide functionality based on \ncontributions\nAccess to industry data Provide data access based on contributions\nDue to the high number of user contributions, it \nis impossible to employ enough resources to rate all \ncontent according to its quality. Depending on the \ncommercial success, quality checks based on random \nsampling, such as the Continuous Sampling Plan 1 \n\(CSP-1  be done by the \ncommunity. This is less problematic than in many \nconsumer networks, as many of the business users \nwill indeed be domain experts. [38] present an \nadaptive incentive mechanism for contributing and nrating content in an e-learning community which \nshares some of the features with the proposed \nmechanism Due to the completely different context, \nthe focus of [38]’s mechanism is to promote a certain \nnumber of user participations within a limited amount \nof time, while the focus of the proposed incentive \nscheme is to determine the quality of user \ncontributions in order to promote quantity and quality \nof contributions.  \nWe suggest calculating a quality score for every \nEPI, based on all ratings for the EPI and the \nparticipating business user’s historical rating \nexpertise. Whether organizations and business users \nhave to be distinguished depends on the actual use \ncase. Based on the deviation of all ratings of a \nbusiness user from the EPI quality scores, his \nindividual rating expertise score is calculated. Before \nthe rating is submitted the user cannot see the EPI \nquality score. This prohibits a bias towards the \ndisplayed score as well as provides an additional \nincentive for rating. The aggregation of the rating \ndeviations to a rating expertise score, as well as the \naggregation of the EPI quality scores to an overall \ncontent quality score can be done leveraging diverse \nalgorithms [43]. Figure 1 depicts the basic functional \nprinciple of the proposed reputation system, which \nprovides the basis for incentives such as further \ndissemination of the reputation monetary incentives, \nincorporation in supplier evaluations, enhanced \nfunctionality, or access to a larger amount of \nindustrial data. \nContent \nReputation \nscore\nRating \nExpertise \nScore\nEPI 1 Quality \nScore\nEPI m Quality \nScore\nRating 1 on \nEPI 1\nEPIs\nOrganizations\nRating n on \nEPI 1\nRatings\nDeviation \nfrom EPI \nQuality Score\nFigure 1.

The \napproach was implemented based on a prototypical \nIO-ERIS \(see figure 2 for an illustration of how meta-\ninformation is displayed in the prototype 


experts agreed that this concept has \nthe potential to improve the overall data quality \nwithin the IO-ERIS The consortium partners will be \nusing the system and evaluate it based on defined test \ncases. This will provide the basis for a more detailed \nevaluation in the future. The main statements of the \nevaluation workshop are summarized below: \n The information quality challenges in \nenvironmental reporting cannot be solved by \ntechnical means alone. It will require the \ninvolvement of industry and legislation to \ndefine unambiguous standards. \n The transparency provided by the prototypical \nIO-ERIS could help to accelerate the formation \nof de-facto standards. \n The expert evaluations can provide a very \nvaluable first estimation of data quality, in \nparticular for non-experts, who are the main \nusers of IO-ERIS. \n All meta-information was found very useful. \nExpert users particularly found the context and \nproperties information useful, while non-experts \npreferred the automated traffic lights and \ncompleteness checks. \nThe research at hand contributes to the academic \nstate of the art in knowledge systems by defining the \nsub-domain of IO-ERIS and particular requirements \nfor information quality in the domain of \nenvironmental reporting. These results are further of \npractical relevance for improving the outcomes of \nenvironmental report, such as annual sustainability \nreports and ad-hoc reports. \n8. Conclusion and Outlook \nThe aim of this paper was the design of an\napproach to improve the information quality in IO-\nERIS as a particular type of KMS. In order to achieve nthis, the design science methodology was applied.\nLeveraging the state of the art in academic literature \nand industrial practice, requirements for information \nquality were extracted. Based on these, a two-folded napproach was developed, consisting of meta-\ninformation to be documented and displayed in the \nIO-ERIS, and an incentive scheme to encourage high \nquality information contributions by the participants. \nThe research included a first evaluation in an industry \nworkshop. Future work will include the results from \non on-going user evaluation. Furthermore the transfer \nof the proposed approach to product-related \nenvironmental information will be studied.  \n8.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
