Business decisions are based on extraction of useful knowledge from different data sources Those data sources, usually called the big data, might be huge digital data sets such as an internal data warehouse or external sources like the web In order to process the big data, one needs to have smart solutions, analytics services, programming tools and applications. Intelligent age nts can perform certain tasks such as big data processing, information retrieval and the creation of OLAP \(On-Line Analytical Processing\cubes which represent multidimensional data. Given that volumes of data grow continuously, insurance companies have to be able manage them.  The agent technology has the potential to become the key technology for management of ever-increasing amount of information. This paper describes how to develop MAS in order to gather useful kno wledge from the data source and automate the specific process for better business decision Keywords Multi Agent Systems, Artificial Intelligence, On-Line Analytical Processing, Decision Support, Big Data, Business Intelligence, JADE, OLAP, MAS, BI I I NTRODUCTION In the second half of the last century information sciences focused on data in general, and in particular on data collection, storage, transfer, sharing, analysis and, last but not least, data usage. Data volume increases on a daily level and we have become unable to store and analyze such amount. According to the Gartner’s analysis, the amount of data grows by 50% every year Gartner’s analysis proves that information has become one of the most valuable assets that organizations have. Invest ors know how valuable information-centered businesses are and new informationbased revenue streams are becoming a mainstream process across different industries. The Big Data" technology innovation is challenging the existing information infrastructure. Information managem ent is a top priority for organizations around the world. [1  The term “Big Data” is used to describe large volumes of both unstructured an d structured data, so big and complex that practically no one can use them with traditional management tools and applicati ons for analysis. Text archive files, images, videos, social networks, e-commerce medicine, the military, internet indexing, searching etc account for the enormous data increase.  Moreover, the information industry shifts to mobile computing, provision of cloud and it relies on analysis of large volumes of data Modern trends pose serious difficulties in management of large data volumes, and th is is especially true of business analytics data because standard techniques cannot support it New requirements expect from organizations to discover knowledge from their internal or external data sources which can help organizations to ma ke better business decisions The process of knowledge discovery is an integral part of the Business Intelligence \(BI nology approach that has been used increasingly, especially in last few decades, when a lot of new applications on that can help organization to improve business process and make better business decisions appeared on the market In order to improve their decision making process organizations have created the right environment to respond to these new challenges. The environment which enables organizations to extract and store extracted information is called the Data Warehouse \(DW The DW covers a group of technologies and techniques which help employees to handle data more easily. The Figure 1 below shows typical architecture for supporting business decision systems within the organization. In order to have an effective system appropriate methods have to be developed, which will gather and process data from multiple di fferent data sources and in different data formats, such as the web, text documents binary, etc. Such data should be cleansed and should be stored in the organization’s data warehouse. Also, the data contained in the DW needs to be cataloged, maintained and corrected. Furthermore, the data warehouse needs to be updated as the new data comes in, for example, last month’s sales.

The term “ontology” applies to business terms and rules that enable people to manipulate the real business problems and make business decisions based on intelligent agents. Introducing intelligent agents into big data processing, especially for busi ness decision support, can reduce human workload. This is mainly due to agents MIPRO 2014, 26-30 Ma y 2014, Opati j a, Croatia 1118 


independence, i.e. autonomous pro perties, which enable agents to act on behalf of humans in a business process especially in the field of data acquisition and collection The following sections present an overview of the decision making technology process and agent-oriented technology programming approach using the JADE 1 technology \(Java Agent De velopment Framework\he last section provides a simple example of exchange of business information between two agents that help the staff in an organization to make better business decision II D ECISION MAKING TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW The Figure 1 presents typical architecture for supporting BI and knowledge discovery.  The data comes from different sources, structured or unstructured. Data sources might be of different quality and in different formats Sometime, the data might even be inconsistent. Problems of integrating, cleaning and standardizing such data are challenging but imperative because the necessary successful environment exists The first step in establishment of architecture for a successful BI system as a basis for knowledge discovery and business decisions is collection of data from its source. The so-called ETL \(Extract, Transfo rm, Load\methods present the crucial procedure in the data gathering process.  These methods help to establish and correct problems in data quality. They also facilitate efficient lo ading of large data volumes to the Data Warehouse \(DW The DW is a collection of data and collection of decision support technologies that assist an employee with sufficient knowledge \(executive, manager and analyst\ake better and faster decisions. Data can be stored in many different types of databases; however, th e data in DW is stored on a single site. In order to create a DW, data should be extracted from the source, cleansed \(free of errors\ed summarized\loaded into a data store – DW \(ETL DW servers are divided from operational databases and they have their own database which is used only for decision support. Data stored in a DW share the following characteristics Subject oriented data is logically organized around the main item, e.g. customers, sales, etc Integrated all of the data organized around such an item is combined and can be analyzed together Time variant historical data is maintained in hi storical form and Nonvolatile data is read-only, not updated or changed by user  Once data is ready for qu erying, i.e. cleansed, filtered and corrected, employees should be able to query and perceive it from multiple di mensions. The Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP\enables operations like filtering aggregation, pivo ting, rollup and drill-down of multidimensional data. Th e main difference between DWs and the OLAP is a different data view. DWs are based on relational technology while OLAP uses a multidimensional  1 JADE is distributed agent platform created according to FIPA standards It is developed in the programming language Java \(J2SE\ being distributed via „Telecom Italia“, available as an open source platform with LGPL license. Source: http://jade.tilab.com view of aggregated data. Use of a multidimensional view provides quick access to further analysis.  A data analyst manager or executive can analyze data from different views in a fast and interactive way The OLAP systems have the ability to answer to the who and what but it is their ability to answer the what if and why questions that sets them apart from Data Warehouses. The OLAP, with its capabilities, transforms the DW into strategic information moving data access from information to knowledge. All the applications that use the OLAP have to be able to deliver information just-in-tim The OL AP sys t em s work wit h very large databases, up to petabytes, and thanks to that feature, the OLAP can be appropriate for intensive workloads. In addition, it is more tolerant to ACID 2 design  OLAP is nothing else but the multidimensional view of data in the DW. In multidimensional models a set of numeric measures exist that are subject to analysis. Such measures include sales, the budget, inventory etc Dimensions represent the context for the measure. Examples of dimensions associated with the sale amount include the city, product name, date, etc. All dimensions uniquely determine the measure. Each dimension is further described by a set of attributes. For example, the Product dimension has the category of attributes and the industry of the product. The Figure 2 depicts the multidimensional view of the data Dimensions: Product, City, Date Hierarchical summarization paths Industry Category Product  Country State City Date Product City Figure 2 Multidimensional data The OLAP conceptual model has features such as aggregation of measures by one or more dimensions. This feature is one of the key features in the OLAP. Computing and ranking of the total sales of a policy by a broker or within a city can be examples of aggregation.  Another popular operation in the OLAP is comparison between two measures – for example, the sales and budget aggregated by certain dimensions. One of the most important dimensions in the decision support analysis is time, for example, the trend an III M ULTI A GENT SYSTEMS The Agent Oriented Programming \(AOP\ is a software paradigm that brings concep ts from the artificial intelligence theory to the center of the distributed systems. The AOP essentially shapes th e applications as collections of components called agents, charact erized as autonomous with the possibility of communication. Being autonomous as they are, they have the capability to handle complex tasks. Agents must be able to communicate, negotiate and  2 ACID represents design philosophies which focus on consistency and it is traditional approach of databases. ACID means: A-Atomicity, CConsistency, I-Isolation and D-Durab 1119 


cooperate in “open” environment. Given that they have the ability of communication, th ey are able to interact with other entities, work for their own ag enda and for agendas of other agents. The architecture of agent-oriented applications is exclusively peer-to-peer, implying that every agent is capable to initiate communication an d to reply to requests at any time. A number of independe nt issues must be resolved when adopting an Agen t system to solve specific domain problems - for example communication between agents Multi Agent Systems should be on the top of agent-oriented infrastructure as independent, a llowing developers to focus on the business logic  A The JADE architecture Applications developed on the JADE platform are comprised of a set of components called Agents each bearing a different name. Agents perform tasks and they communicate via message exchange. Agents live at the top of the platform that provides the basic information, such as message delivery. Just as the methods, objects etc., the programming agents represent one form of programming abstractions. The difference between an agent and object is the fact that the object is a programming abstraction describing the methods and attributes of the programming component, while the agent is a software abstraction at an even higher level of abstraction, enabling the simple and powerful tool for construct ion of complex programming entities. Unlike objects defined by attributes and methods the programming agent is defi ned by its behavior. This fact is very significant because it reduces the programming of agent systems to the specification of the certain agents behavior The JADE is completely developed in the Java programming language. It simpli fies the implementation of Multi Agent Systems respecting the FIPA 3 Foundation for Intelligent Physical Ag ents\via the graphical tools, it supports the develop ment and testing phases. The agent platform can be distribu ted to several computers being controlled via graphical interface implemented in the JADE Framework. The programming agent needs to be autonomous, mobile, purpos eful, stabile, communicative and capable of learning. The JA DE programming platform includes one or more containers. Containers can be executed on different hosts \(computers, m obile devices etc.\ making a distributed platform. Each container may contain one or more agents. Figure nts the  basic elem ents of the JADE architecture  The Main container is a special form of container capable of containing agents but still very much different from other containers because th e Main container is a place at which other agents register and it includes two different agents: the AMS \(Agent Management System\ represents an authoritative agen t, the only one that is ab le to start and stop  3 FIPA \(Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents\a nonprofit standardization organization dealing with the standardization of the programming agents and agent platforms. FIPA standardizes the architecture of agent systems, agent management, their communication etc the platform, and the DF \(Directory Facilitator the “Yellow Pages”, as we might call it, a place used by agents to advertise their services, that the other agents can browse through to search for information, depending on their needs  The JADE platform  m a y contain m u ltiple containers like Container 1, on the Host 3, which contains the Agents A2 and A3 Agents can communicate transparently, depending on their location; for example A2 or A3 can communicate; as well as A1 and A2 and although they belong to different containers, they are on the sa me platform. Communication is possible between A1 and A5, even though they belong to different platforms. Comm unication is based on asynchronous passage of messages. The message format is determined by the ACL \(Age nt Communication Language a language defined by the FIPA \(Figure 9 Figure 3 JADE architecture A FIPA message includes the following data: the Sender agent sending the message, the Receiver agent receiving the message and the Message itself - intended for communication acts representing the sender’s intention. For example, when the agent sends the INFORM message, it wants to inform the receiver of the fact \(e.g. INFORM “It’s raining today”\When th e agent sends the REQUEST message, it demands an action from the receiver. The FIPA differentiates between 22 possible communication acts covering 95% \(it does not support the remaining 5%\e possible situations.

Ontologies represent abstract concepts and a relation for a specific domain. They can be shared and used many times across the internet by knowledge repres entation languages such as the Resource Description Framework \(RDF\eb Ontology Language \(OWL According to the FIPA terminology, this syntax is known as the content language. The FIPA does not enforce these standards; they are recommendations how to communicate with AMS and DF agents –most significant in the JADE architecture An example of the cont ent language recommended by the FIPA Policy :number 123456 :seller Ivan :insured Mark When the agent receives this string, it has to be able to convert the string in the appropriate format to understand the information contained in the stri ng. It also has to be able to share the meanin g with the sender of the string and symbol concept \(„Policy, number seller, insured”\for the structure expression. This set of concepts and symbols is known as ontology. The ontology is independent and inherently related to the corresponding research domain Ontology-supported work makes the JADE capable for complex content operation. Soft ware developers can choose to work with JADE classes, JAVA serialization, XML, or with some other technology depending on their needs. The classification offered by the FIPA is the one separating the ACL message into two sections predicates and terms as indicated in the Figure   Term IRE Concept Primitive Agregate Variable Agent Action Element Content Element List Content Element Predicate  Can be used as the Content of an ACL message Can be True or False Indicated entities abstract or concrete Figure 5 Reference model Predicates are expressions describing the status of a certain object and they can be true or false Insured \(Person :name Ivan\ \(Municipality :name Split Description of the insured person, “person named Ivan from “the Municipality of Split Predicates are used for the INFORM or QUERY-IF message content exchange, e.g. if two agents want to exchange some facts Terms are expressions identifying entities that exist in the real world.

Agents have to be able to perform several competing tasks to respond to di fferent requests. For this purpose every agent has the possib ility to implement different behavior types, ranging from those simple ones, performed only once to those performed until a certain condition is fulfilled, unless otherwise specified. Th e Figure 6 shows the JADE framework behavior hierarc hy. [8 The  beha vior al state has to be contained in corresponding agents. Every agent cares about its behavioral state, such as the action completion and the action blockage  Behaviour Composite Behaviour Simple Behaviour FMS Behaviour Sequential Behaviour Parallel Behaviour OneShot Behaviour Cyclic Behaviour Waker Behaviour Ticker Behaviour Figure 6 The Jade behavior hierarchy The FIPA has specified interaction protocol stacks used for inter-agent communication. For every conversion, the JADE differentiates between the roles of the initiator and the agent replying Responder essages. The Figure 7 shows inter-agent commun ication structure. The Initiator sends the message, and the responder may reply with the message “not understood”, refuse to reply with the message refuse” or agree with the message via “agree”. If the agent replies with “agree”, the messag e is sent so quickly that it can be considered as an unnecessary burde communicative act not-understood refuse reason agree failure reason inform Done\(action Inform iota x\(result action\ x Figure 7 The Interaction Protocol Homogeneous Structure IV I NSURANCE MAS EXAMPLE This example comes from the Insurance domain and describes one of many situations in which employees need information to make a decision about th eir business actions This is a problem not only for employees working in headquarters or static wo rkers in other offices, but also for mobile employees. As the number of mobile and online users in the world continues to grow so do the ways in which mobile users can gath er the right information. All employees, ranging from a CEO to a seller, can request and obtain, automatically or on demand, a critical alert or information that is important for their business operations to their mobile phone or a sm art phone. Every mobile phone equipped with appropriate software becomes a mobile agent capable of imitating communi cation with the headquarter agent who will resp ond to their queries To demonstrate this, we have developed two agents with different roles using the JADE architecture. One of them has a double role and rep resents the most important agent in the process since it discovers knowledge and upon discovering it, it sends it as information to mobile agents. Mobile agent is the second agent that only initiates communication The database includes two tables: one, titled “Policies includes the concluded policies, and the second, titled Persons” that contains data of the policy holders. The Figure 8 indicates the database structure PERSONS ID PK  Surname Place Name  POLICIES Number PK  Person  FK Price Figure 8 Database structure The Agent that discovers knowledge, called the “Main agent, obtains the statistical figures regarding the number of issued insurance policies and the realized premium. When the “Main” agent finds the right information it sends it to mobile agents, known as the “Seller” agents. The Main agent offers to the Seller agent available information that it has and offers the Seller agent to accept or refuse it depending on the Seller’s needs. The Seller agent performs the “Seller“behavior, send ing the query on the schedule time passing through the corresponding communication steps Figure 9\. Every step requires corresponding behavior depending on the message type The next code snippet covers a part of communication between the Main agent and the Seller agent if \(messageRecieve.getPerformative ACLMessage.CFP messageAnswer.setPerforma tive\(ACLMessage.INFORM messageAnswer.setConversationId\("policy messageAnswer.setContent\("MAIN: Available Sent message myAgent.send\(messageAnswer else if messageRecieve.getPerformative ACLMessage.ACCEPT_PROPOSAL messageAnswer.setPerformative ACLMessage.PROPOSE messageAnswer.setConversationId\("policy messageAnswer.setContent\("MAIN: Number Send message myAgent.send\(messageAnswer In the first step, the Seller agent sends the CFP \(Call for Proposal available statistics. The behavior defining the CFP message is „SendCfpRequest“. The Main agent grasps that this is a CFP message and sends back the INFORM message, informing the Seller agen t about the available statistics 1122 


Figure 9 JADE Communication between Seller and Main Agent The Seller agent accepts the proposal from the Main agent via “ReceiveCfpRequest” behavior and returns the message ACCEPT_PROPOSAL. The behavior defining the proposal is “CofirmRequest”, whereby th e Main agent, using the appropriate methods, contacts the distributed databases and by performing the queries \(SQL select\he Main agent sends the corresponding information via the message PROPOSE. Then, the Seller agent accepts the statistics via the “AcceptStatistics” behavior and prints them to the console After running the application, th e console displays the following  Agent container Main-Container@10.170.2.57 is ready SELLER: Request for statistic MAIN: Available statistics are number of sold policies and premium SELLER: Accept! Give me all statistics MAIN  Number of sold policies: 8 Premium: 2900.0  V C ONCLUSION Due to the large amount of information, intelligent software agents organized in the Multi Agent Systems represent a solution to the problem of gathering, processing and using information. Intelligent software agents are a collection of technology that ensure development of advanced services because it enables creation of intelligent services, tailor-made to the needs of a user. By using software agents, certain tasks, otherwise performed independently by users, can now be automated. Intelligent software agents support business processes due to their great potential, especially in terms of processing and ma intenance of large amounts of informa tion stored in heterogeneous dislocated information sources. Implementation of a business process solution th rough the Multi Agent System based on the JADE framework, such as the one presented in the paper, is straightforward and intuitive. With the development and spread of new mobile hardware, problems such as detection of individu al system entities and users and their communication are entering into a new phase. New trends and increase in the number of users of smart devices result in larger number of services these devices can provide. The fact that each user has a smart device in his/her immediate vicinity and that he/she can store new data at any moment, indicates the need to synchronize this data with other systems, as well as the need for various data access VI R EFERENCES  Inform ation 2020: Big Data and Bey ond  http://www.gartner.com/, Business Intelligence & Information Management, Featured Webinar  An Overview of B u siness Inteligence Technology Communication of the ACM August 2011, Vol. 54, DOI: 10.1145/1978542.1978562, Surajit Chaudhuri, Umeshwar Dayal, Vivek Narasayya  Data W a rehousing Data m i ning OLAP and OLTP technologies are essential elements to support decision-making process in industries, \(IJCSE l Journal on Computer Science and Engineering, Vol. 02 No. 09, 2010, 2865-2873 G.Satyanarayana Reddy, Rallabandi Srinivasu, M.Poorna Chander Rao, Srikanth Reddy Rikkula, ISSN: 0975-3397  OLAP Council http://www.olapcouncile.com  Cloud-hoste d databases: technologie s, challenges and opportunities, Sherif Sakr, Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013  CAP Tw elwe Years Later How th e rules have changed, Eric Brewer, University of California, Berkeley, Computer magazine, February 2012  An Overview of Data W a rehousing and OLAP Technology  Surajit Chaudhuri, Umeshwar Dayal  Developing Multi-Agent Syste m s wit h JADE Fabio Bellifemine, Telecom Italia, Italy Giovanni Caire, Telecom Italia, Italy Dominic Greenwood, Whitestein Technologies AG, Switzerland  JADE Ad m inistrat ion Tutorial http://jade.tilab.com/doc/tutorials/JADEAdmin/index.html Author: David Grimshaw \(Ryerson Univer sity\ 26, 2010  JADE P r ogra m m e r’s Guide  http://jade.tilab.com/doc/programmersguide.pdf Fabio Bellifemine, Giovanni Caire, Tiziana Trucco \(TILAB formerly CSELT\, Giovanni Rimassa \(University of Parma 08-April-2010.

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
