customer assignment based on affinity score uses the \nrelative improvement in errors as a metric. Hence, it addresses \ncases where there is already one or more customers in each \ncluster, thereby giving it a prior prediction error to compare \nagainst. However, the initial customer – also called the seed \ncustomer – that is placed in each cluster can influence the \nclustering quality, and this process of selecting the initial ncustomer for a cluster is called cluster seeding.\nIn the most basic form, a random customer is selected as the \nseed customer for each cluster. This is called random seeding\nand it is elegant in its simplicity similar to the random order in \nwhich customers are incrementally considered for cluster \nassignment. There is also no overhead in this process as any \ncustomer can be chosen, and this is an unsupervised technique.\nThis is also similar to the random partition used as in the initial \niteration of k-means clustering, except that k-means has the \nopportunity to select the centroid as the seed in subsequent \niterations. Our incremental clustering does just a single pass.  \nAnother hypothesis is to order the list of customers based on \nsome measure, evenly partition this ordered space into the total \nnumber of clusters, and pick the medial customer within each \npartition as the initial seed for each cluster. We call this \nsupervised approach as midpoint seeding. The measure used for \nordering is domain specific and can help offer a more balanced \nnumber of customers in each cluster while also reducing their \nMAPE error %. In our case, we propose three measures: the naverage of the KWh in the time series for each customer, the \nstandard deviation of the KWh time series for each customer, \nand the MAPE error % for each customer’s individual ARIMA \nprediction. The former uses the intuition that customers with \nsimilar load sizes \(i.e. small, medium and large uses of energy complement the magnitude of variation in energy \nconsumption. The latter offers customers with different nvariability \(hence error Number of Clusters  \nThe number of clusters that are created can have an impact \non the MAPE, as also on the domain needs. By default, one can \nuse a static number of clusters that is specified by the user,\nsimilar to the value of “k” in k-means clustering. This can be \npicked either because of the need for a specific number of cluster \nin the domain or the need to control the number of customers in \na cluster \(assuming a balanced distribution of customer counts, \nthough not guaranteed trivial static number of clusters in our experiments. \nHowever, when there is no strong need to pin the number of nclusters to a static value, it may be possible to grow the number \nof clusters elastically, based on the need to optimize some \nmetric. We propose a heuristic for elastic number of clusters that \nhas a lower and an upper bound on the number of clusters, mlo\nand mhi. The number of clusters is incremented by one in case \nan incoming customer does not improve the MAPE for any \nexisting cluster by more than a threshold value, t. This offers \nflexibility to the domain application, both in the range of cluster \ncounts as well as the rate at which the errors improve as \ncustomers are added. It also allows the algorithm to grow the \nnumber clusters based on need rather than be bound to an initial \nset of static clusters with a static seed customer in each This can \nalso help to capture customers who are “outliers” in a separate \ncluster rather than force them into an existing cluster, and \nthereby make its error worse. For our experiments, we use three \npairs of lower-upper cluster bounds, 1-15, 3-6, and 6-15, and use \ntwo different thresholds, t=0% and t=1%. The former forces the \nerrors for existing clusters to monotonically decrease as \ncandidate customers are added, adding a new cluster otherwise. \nThe latter expects an even faster drop in error, by 1% or more, \nfor every new customer added. \nV.EMPIRICAL RESULTS\nFor the experimental evaluation of the incremental \nclustering technique and its optimizations we use a sample of 84 \nsmart meters from a utility service area as a representative npopulation. The smart meter’s kWh consumption data is\nrecorded for 3 month period at 15-min interval or 3x30x96 = \n8,600 intervals, for a total of ~725,000 data points across all \nsmart meters on which the results were validated. \n We used 2 months of data per smart meter as a training for \nthe ARIMA and the last one month for calculating the MAPE of \nthe ARIMA model. Besides the training, other optimizations \nsuch as midpoint seed also used the 2-month time series data for \ntheir heuristics. All experiments were repeated multiple times nand the representative results presented. The order of the smart \nmeters was randomized before each experimental run. All \nexperiments were scripted using the R statistical package and \nrun on a server with 16-core Opeteron processors and 64GB \nRAM. Each experimental run took between 5-40 hours to \ncomplete using a single threaded process, depending on the \nnumber of clusters. We observed that the total clustering time \nwas a linear function of the number of clusters, thereby bearing \nout our time complexity estimate of O\(?.n.m for n=84 smart \nmeters, a constant ? as the time taken to build a single ARIMA \nmodel, and the number of clusters ‘m’ being the variable.\nA. Impact of Cluster Seeding \nIn our initial experiment, we use the random seeding to \nassign a different random initial smart meter \(i.e., customer cluster sizes we consider: 1, 3, 6 and \n15 clusters. Note that the 1-cluster case is a trivial scenario \nwhere 


all customers are clustered into one, and this gives a \nnominal “best case” scenario for MAPE from clustering and acts \na lower bound for our clustering experiment. On the other hand, \nwe use 15 as the upper bound of the number of clusters, with \neach cluster having on an average 4 customers – as it can be \nobserved from figure 3\(a of 3 and 6 give us reasonable midpoints for comparison \nbetween the upper and low bounds. We use the standard affinity \nscore for incremental clustering of each customer that looks for \nthe best error reduction in each cluster. Figure 4 shows the \nresults of this experiment.  \n33\nIt is worthwhile comparing these plots against the equivalent \nplots from Figure 3, which used a round-robin assignment. In \nFigure 4\(a instance where adding a customer \nactually increased the MAPE  of a cluster using the affinity \nscore, as opposed to 6 instances when this happened in the \nround-robin assignment in Figure 3\(a see \nin Figures 3\(b b blue dotted line cluster, ranging from 12-\n20% improvement in relative MAPE. This is a 1-2% \nimprovement in absolute MAPE e.g., 11% vs. 13.8% for the 15-\ncluster case for affinity-score vs. round-robin. The improvement \nis even more significant when considering the standard \ndeviation of MAPE between clusters in an experiment \(yellow \ndotted line compared to \nround-robin. This shows the value of our proposed similarity \nmetric in not just reducing the average MAPE for clusters but \nachieving an even error % across clusters. The obvious \nadvantage of the round-robin technique is of course in its ability \nto balance the number of customers in a cluster \(Figures 3\(c c 3-cluster case. \nWe next compare the random seed method against the \nmidpoint seed optimization. Three different customer ordering \napproaches were used for determining the midpoint for the \npartitions, and hence the initial seed for each cluster. The \ncustomers were ordered based on their average KWh for the 2 \nmonth time series data, the standard deviation of this 2 month \ntime series, and the MAPE when predicting their consumption \nusing an ARIMA model built for each customer. We observed \nthat there was not tangible difference in the MAPE for the \nmidpoint seed approach compared to the random seed approach \nfor the different static cluster sizes. However, there was a \nnoticeable different in the absolute standard deviation of their \nMAPE depending on the ordering chosen for the midpoint seed \ncompared to the random seed.   \nFigure 5\(a absolute standard deviations in the \nMAPE for the different seed approaches for the different static \ncluster sizes of 1, 3, 6 and 15.

Impact of Cluster Size Elasticity \nIn this experiment we set the number of clusters to fall nbetween an upper and lower bound, and the number of clusters \ngrow elastically when an incoming customer is unable to \nimprove the MAPE error % of any existing cluster by a certain \nthreshold. We evaluate lower and upper bounds of 3-6, 6-15 and \n1-15 clusters, with thresholds of 0% and 1%. Figure 6\(a incremental clustering strategy in action for elastic clusters \nwith lower bound of 6 clusters and upper bound of 15 clusters, \nand a 1% threshold. We see that there are initially 6 clusters, \nshown by 6 initial MAPE values, and occasionally, an \nadditional MAPE line springs up, denoting the creation of a new \ncluster. Since we have a threshold of 1% here, each addition of \na customer has to either reduce the MAPE for a cluster by 1 or \ncause a new cluster to be created.  \nFigure 6\(b these elastic combinations, as also the average and standard \ndeviations of MAPE error % as line plots for each combination. \nThe merits of the elastic cluster strategy is in automatically \ntrading-off the number of clusters against the average MAPE \nerror % for the clusters, without having the users pick an \nunsuitable static number of clusters that can cause either a high \nMAPE error % \(if more clusters are statically chosen or fewer \nclusters without any improvement in MAPE. Note that in our \ndomain, more clusters are better. In some cases, such as 3-6\nclusters, we do not see any clear improvement of this method. \nFor e.g., the static 3-cluster, 3-6 elastic cluster \(0% and 1 7.65%,\n7.22%, and 7.20% respectively. So picking an elastic number of \ncluster here is as bad \(or marginally worse 6-15 elastic cluster \(0% and 1 respectively, we see that 6-15 elastic \(0 while \noffering more number of clusters \(7 trade-off in improving the number \nof clusters with minimal gain in error may have been missed. \nOne of the side effects of this elasticity is that there is a higher \nstandard deviation in the number of customers per cluster. This \nis understandable. Since clusters can be created very late, there \nis a greater skew in the number of customers present in clusters \nthat were added early vs. those that were added late nVI.CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduced a novel similarity measure for \nperforming incremental clustering of time series datasets, with \nthe goal of using the cumulative values of the clusters for \nperforming time series predictions. This is a novel application \nof clustering as a form of coarsening different time series entities \nto perform more accurate predictions, and for which existing \ndistance-based clustering techniques do not suffice. This is of \nunique value for predictive analytics over high velocity Big Data \nthat often have a time series structure. We have validated our \nproposed clustering and optimization techniques for the Smart nGrid domain using real datasets, and in addition to the \nqualitative improvements in the prediction errors and cluster \nbalancing, we observe a poly time complexity with the number \nof time series datasets and clusters. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis material is based upon work supported by the United \nStates Department of Energy under Award Number \nDEOE0000192, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and \nPower \(LA DWP and opinions of authors expressed \nherein do not necessarily state or reflect those of the United \n\(a Incremental reduction in MAPE as each new customer is from \namong 6 clusters, initially, and among 15 cluster finally.

For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
