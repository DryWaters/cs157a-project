with hierarchical structure, thus it is properly applied to the description of mining association rules in databases. Compared with well-known Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, mining association rules on concept lattice does not need to scan databases for many times, and shows association rules on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice more visual and concise moreover, it can be used to mine association rules interactively according to user\222s subjective interest, then solves the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition effectively thus it is properly applied to the description of association rule mining in databases. Although the time complexity of building concept lattice algorithm is 
usually higher than FP-Growth algorithm, less than Apriori algorithm, association rule mining based on concept lattice has its own advantage,  which represents the association rules more vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, thus, it can be easily applied in molecular biology to manage and analyze biology data. For example, because DNA and protein sequences are essential biological data and exist in huge volumes as well ,it is very important to apply association rule mining to compare and align biology sequences and find biosequence patterns and discovery of disease-causing gene connections and gene-drug 
interactions as an effective method Keywords:association rule; concept lattice; biological data; data mining I  I NTRODUCTION  Association rule[1,2 i n i n g i s an i m p o r tan t d a ta m i n i n g  method for determining consumer purchasing patterns in transaction databases. Nowadays, many applications have used to discover useful information Concept lattice was presented by R. Wille[3 l ect s  entity-attribute relationships between objects, and  represents knowledge shown with hierarchical structure on the Hasse diagram, thus it is properly applied to the description of association rule mining in databases. Apriori algorithm 
employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search where k-itemsets are used to explore\(k+1\itemsets, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found by scanning the database to accumulate the count for each item, and collecting those items that satisfy minimum support. The resulting set is denoted L 1  Next, L 1 is used to find L 2 the set of frequent 2-itemsets which is used to find L 3 and so on, until no more frequent kitemsets can be found. The finding of each L k requires one of full scan of the database. The Apriori algorithm s used  to discover frequent itemsets in order to mine association rules from frequent itemsets 
The shortcoming of Apriori algorithm is that it needs scan the database for many times in the course of finding frequent itemsets, and in the join step, to find L k a set of candidate kitemsets is generated by joining L k-1 with itself, costs a great deal of CPU time FP-growth\(Frequent Pattern-growth\[7-13,27 op t s a divide-and-conquer strategy as follows. First, it compresses the database representing frequent items into frequent-pattern tree which retains the itemsets association information, it then divides the compressed database into a set of conditional databases, each associated with one frequent item or \223 pattern 
fragment\224 ,and mines each such database separately A study on the performance of the FP-growth method shows that it is efficient and scalable for both long and short frequent pattern, and is magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm Bioinformatics is a promising young field that applies computer science and technology in the molecular biology and develops algorithms and methods to manage and analyze biological data. Because DNA and protein sequences are essential biological data and exist in huge volumes as well, it is important to develop effective methods to compare and align biology sequences and discover biosequence pattern And, association rule mining is an effective method and algorithm to apply to bioinformatics 
Association rules\(or Genetic Association\ in gene biology sequences and biosequence patterns are mainly implemented using the method: On the basis of hypothesisdriven theory, candidate gene analysis is directly connected with systemic knowledge of biological function, whereas a whole-genome association theoretically investigates the entire genome simultaneously[14,15  H o w e ve r  t he r e a r e fe w  methods to analyze the entire genome for complex diseases have been established with respect to the availability of unbiased reliability and cost efficiency.

developed a practical and efficient strategy for an extensive region-wide association with evenly spaced dense SNPs markers In this paper, the contribute is that association rule mining based on concept lattice has been applied to discovery of disease-causing gene connections and gene-drug interactions as an effective method, and the Hasse diagram of concept lattice represents the association rules more visual vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm  The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we review the preliminaries of association rules, basic notions of concept lattice, association rule mining on concept lattice is described in section III, , an example of mining association rules based on concept  lattice is illustrated in section IV, finally, we reach the conclusion in section  V II  B ASIC NOTIONS OF ASSOCIATION RULE  AND  CONCEPT LATTICE  A  Basic notions of association rule Mining association rule is an important branch of data mining, which describes potential relations among data items attribute, variant\ databases, The well-known Apriori algorithm was proposed by R. Agrawal et al., in 1993. Mining association rules can be stated as follows Let I={i 1 i 2 i m be a set of items. Let D, the taskrelevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T  I. The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, A transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A  T. An association rule is an implication of the form A B, where A  I, B  I, and A  B  The rule A B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A  B \(i.e., both A and B\. This is taken to be the probability, P\(A  B\The rule A B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P\(B|A That is, Support \(A B\P\(A  B\s Confidence\(A B|A\pport\(A B\Support \(A Association rule mining should be mining strong association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence threshold B  Basic notions of concept lattice A context is defined as a triple C=\(O,D,R where O is a set of objects, D is a set of attributes, and R is the binary relation between O and D, according to the inclusion relations between extents and intents, there is an unique ordered set that describes the structure of inherent lattice, which defines natural groupings and relationship descriptions between the objects and their attributes in the context, this structure is also known as \(Galois\ncept Lattice[3,2  f or sh or t  CL Definition 2.1 Each pair such as \(A,B\ved from the context is called a concept, where A  P\(O\, B  P\(D\, and P\(O\ P\(D\re the power sets of O and D respectively, A and B create a connection in terms of the following properties A’={m  D  g  A, gRm}, B’={g  O  g  B, gRm Where A’=B, B’=A. A is called the extent of concept and B is called the intent, denoted as Extent\(C\d Intent \(C respectively Definition 2.2 In a CL, partial order relation “< ” between concept C 1 A 1 B 1 d C 2 A 2 B 2 s defined as C 1 C 2  B 2  B 1 then C 1 is the sub-concept \(son\ C 2 and C 2  is the sup-concept \(father\ C 1 that is, the relation between C 2 and C 1 is the relation as that of father and son If C 1 C 2 there exists no a concept C=\(A,B\uch that satisfies C 1 C<C 2 C 1 C 2 is called a direct-sub-concept-directsup-concept-relation between C 1 and C 2 the Hasse diagram of concept lattice is generated acco rding to the partial order relation: If C 1 C 2 is a direct-sub-concept-direct-sup-concept there exists an edge from C 2 to C 1  From the definitions, the hierarchical relations between the concepts are shown to us, which can be used as an efficient tool for data analysis and knowledge acquisition. And how to build concept lattice, please refer to the generation algorithm of concept lattice in literature[22   III  M INING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT LATTICE  As for concept C=\(A, B\ in a CL, we can introduce support\(B\A|/M of intent B to concept C, M is the sum of transactions in D, |A| is the extent cardinal of concept C Definition 3.1 If Support \(B\ of concept C in a concept lattice is big than the support threshold, the concept C is called a frequent concept, where intent B of concept C is frequent items Theorem 3.1 Frequent items is corresponding to the intents of concepts lattice each other Theorem 3.2 If C=\(A, B\ is a concept in a concept lattice, the support of B is |A|/M, where |A| is the extent cardinal of C, M is the sum of transactions in D. If B is frequent itemsets whose support is bigger than the support threshold, B must be a group of equivalent intents of the concepts According to the theorems me ntioned above, association rules mining based on concept lattice should abide by the theorems as follows[23 Theorem 3.3 If concepts C 1 A 1 B 1  2 A 2 B 2 atisfy C 2  sup\(C 1 we can min association the rule: B 2  B 1 B 2 its confidence is |A 1 A 2 otherwise, B 1 B 2 B 2 its confidence is 100 Theorem 3.4 If concepts C 1 A 1 B 1  C 2 A 2 B 2 not satisfy C 2  sup\(C 1 d there exists nonempty common maximum-sub-concept C=\(A,B\, namely C’=\(A’,B’\, which makes C  sup\(C C 1  sup\(C C 2  sup\(C’\e, there are association rules between B 1 and B 2 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 1 their confidences are |A|/|A 1 A|/|A 2 respectively   


IV  A N EXAMPLE OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON CONCEPT LATTICE  From the definitions and theorems above mentioned, we can mine association rules on concept lattice. Taking a typical Example as market basket analysis on page 236 in literature  T h ere are n i n e trans action s a n d 5 ite m s i n t h is  ALLELectronics  transaction database D, that is M=9. Here assumed that there are nine gene sequences\(namely,9 transactions\d the longest sequence is 5 genes\(namely,5 items\ each gene sequences, less than 5 genes is permissible Next , we want to know how  the 5 genes are arranged in a particular order, then find each sequence with a unique role in cellular function, such as diseasecausing gene connections and gene-drug interactions by the method of association rule mining based on concept lattice According to the items in Table I, the Hasse diagram of concept lattice can be built as shown in Figure 1 The support of frequent itemsets is not divided by M=9 in order to be convenient for explanation. We can easily obtain frequent itemsets, for example, such as the support of frequent itemsets {I 1 is the extent cardinal of concept\({145789},{I 1  whose support is 6,thus,the rest may be deduced by analogy the support of frequent itemsets {I 2 is the extent cardinal of concept\({1234689},{I 2 hose support is 7; the support of frequent itemsets {I 3 is the extent cardinal of concept 356789}, {I 3 whose support is 6; the support of frequent itemsets {I 1 I 2 I 1 I 3 I 2 I 3 I 2 I 4 I 4 is 4, 4, 4, 2 respectively the support of frequent itemsets {I 1 I 2 I 3 I 1 I 2 I 5 I 5 I 1 I 2 I 4 is 2,2,1 respectively Similarly, we can generate association rules from the Hasse diagram in diagram, for example, association rule I 1 I 2 I 5 the support of frequent itemsets {I 1 I 2 and {I 1 I 2 I 5 I 5 is 4,2 respectively, then the confidence of association rule I 1 I 2 I 5 is 2/4, as such I 2 I 5 I 1 I 1 I 2 I 5 I 2 I 1 I 5 whose confidence is 2/2,2/6,2/7 respectively. However association rule I 2 I 5 I 1 Since concept {I 2 I 5 does not exist, there exists an common maximum-sub-concept {I 1 I 2 I 5 I 5 whose support is 2, we can obtain the association rule I 2 I 5 I 1 whose confidence is 2/2. The results are the identified with Apriori to generate association rules Association rule is applied to biosequence pattern, which has mostly advantages over rough set[27  A p r i o r i a l go r i t h m  and FP-growth, we can easily  find the biosequence on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, and the display pattern is very visual, and concise for us to see the genes, nucleotides and amino acids occur in nature with different probabilities As shown in Figure I, taking the 3 concepts \({1234689 I 2 356789},{I 3 and  \({3689}, {I 2 I 3 as an example Gene I 2 and I 3 generate a new gene sequence  Gene I 2 I 3 as for Gene I 2 and I 3 which occur in nature with different probabilities,  4/7 for Gene I 2 and 4/6 for Gene I 3 respectively 4, 7, 6 are the support of frequent itemsets{I 2 I 3 I 2 and {I 3  respectively, namely, in turn are the extent cardinal of concept 1234689}, {I 2 356789}, {I 3 d  \({3689}, {I 2 I 3 On the other hand, from the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, we can clear watch the biosequence pattern relationships, easily find ancestor-child relations and probabilities of biosequence for example, concept \({3689}, {I 2 I 3 e common child of concept \({1234689},{I 2 356789}, {I 3 d. concept 3689}, {I 2 I 3 is the ancestor of concept \({89},{I 1 I 2 I 3 nd 8},{I 1 I 2 I 3 I 5 concept \({89}, {I 1 I 2 I 3 is the father of concept 8},{I 1 I 2 I 3 I 5  V  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, from the above discussion, we can reach the conclusion: From itemsets\(intents of concept lattice\we can intuitively generate association, easily find the biosequence pattern relations on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice, the approach is visual, vivid and concise, users can interactively discover useful association rules in Hasse diagram of concept lattice according to his interest, improve the efficiency of mining, avoid the blindness Mining association rules on concept lattice does not need to scan databases for many times, shows association rules on the Hasse diagram of concept lattice more visual and concise moreover, it can be used to mine association rules interactively according to user’s subjective interest, then solves the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition effectively, thus it is properly applied to the description of association rule mining in databases. Although the time complexity of building concept lattice algorithm is usually higher than FP-Growth algorithm, less than Apriori algorithm, association rule mining based on concept lattice has its own advantage, which represents the association rules more vivid and concise than Apriori and FP-Growth algorithm, thus, it is very important to apply association rule mining to compare and align biology TABLE I.
