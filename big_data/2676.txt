clustering algorithm is also more tolerant to noise compared to traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means because it can explicitly remove the weakly related items 5 Experimental Evaluation r evaluation purposes we have performed our experiments on real data sets obtained from several application domains The characteristics of these data sets are summarized in Table 3 Table 3 Real Data set Characteristics Data set Item Record Avg Length Source Pumsb 2113 49046 74 IBM Almaden S&P 500 932 716 75 Stock Market Retail 14462 57671 8 Retail Store The pumsb data set corresponds to a binary version of a census data set Retail is a masked data set obtained from a large mail-order company In addition the stock market data set contains events representing the price movement of various stocks that belong to the S&P 500 index from January 1994 to October 1996 All experiments were performed on a Sun Ultra 10 workstation with a 440 MHz CPU and 128 Mbytes of memory running the SunOS 5.7 operating system Note that we have implemented hyperclique miner as an extension to the publicly available implementation of the Apriori algorithm by Borgelt http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de 000 borgelt As a result the performance of hyperclique miner is almost equivalent to Apriori when the h-con\223dence threshold is set to zero 5.1 The Pruning Effect of Hyperclique Miner The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the h-con\223dence pruning on hyperclique pattern generation Recently the CHARM algorithm was proposed by Zaki et to ef 223ciently disco v e r frequent closed itemsets As shown in their paper for a dense data set with skewed support distribution such as 000\001\002\003\004  CHARM can achieve relatively better performance than other stateof-the-art pattern mining algorithms such as CLOSET and MAFIA when the support threshold is lo w  Hence we chose CHARM as the baseline to compare against the performance of hyperclique miner on dense data sets even though hyperclique miner and CHARM are actually targeted towards different kinds of patterns Figure 3 shows the number of patterns generated by hyperclique miner and CHARM on the pumsb data set As can be seen the number of patterns discovered by our algorithm is several orders of magnitude smaller than the number of patterns found by CHARM provided that the  100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Number of Hyperclique Patterns Minimum Support Thresholds Confidence-Pruning Effect min_conf = 95  min_conf = 90   min_conf = 85   CHARM  Figure 3 The effect of h-con\223dence pruning in terms of the number of patterns generated 10 100 1000 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Execution Time \(sec Minimum Support Thresholds min_conf = 95  min_conf = 90   min_conf = 85   CHARM  Figure 4 The effect of h-con\223dence pruning in terms of execution time h-con\223dence threshold is suf\223ciently high In addition CHARM has dif\223culties in identifying patterns when the support threshold is less than or equals to 0.4 However our technique identi\223es many strong af\223nity patterns with very low support r instance we obtain a long pattern containing 9 items with the support 0.23 and h-con\223dence 94.2 Recall from Table 1 that nearly 96.6 of the items have support less than 0.4 With a support threshold greater than 0.4 CHARM can only identify associations among a very small fraction of the items Figure 4 shows the relatively performance of hyperclique miner and CHARM on pumsb data set With h-con\223dence pruning we can use hyperclique miner to identify hyperclique patterns even at support threshold equal to zero 5.2 Quality of Hyperclique Patterns Table 4 shows some of the interesting hyperclique patterns extracted from the retail data set r example we identi\223ed a hyperclique pattern involving closely related items such as Nokia battery Nokia adapter and Nokia cell phone We also discovered several interesting patterns containing very low support items such as 001 earrings gold ring bracelet 002  These items are expensive rarely bought by customers and belong to the same product category Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

Speci\223cally for each hyperclique pattern 000 000 000 001 000 002\001 001 002 001\001\001 001 000 002  we calculate the correlation for each pair of items 001 001 001 002\001 002 002 within the pattern The overall correlation of a hyperclique pattern is then de\223ned as the average pair wise correlation Note that this experiment was conducted on Retail data set with the h-con\223dence threshold 0.8 and the support threshold 0.0005 Figure 5 compares the average correlation for hyperclique patterns versus non-hyperclique patterns We sorted the average correlation and displayed them in increasing order Notice that the hyperclique patterns have extremely high average pair wise correlation compared to the nonhyperclique patterns This result supports our previous assertion that hyperclique patterns can identify itemsets that contain only tightly-coupled items 5.3 Hyperclique-based Item Clustering In this section we illustrate the application of hyperclique patterns as an alternative to frequent patterns in hypergraph-based clustering approach W e use the S&P 500 index data set for our clustering experiments Table 5 shows the dramatic increase in the number of frequent patterns as the minimum support threshold is decreased As can be seen the number of frequent patterns increases up to 11,486,914 when we reduce the support threshold to 1 If all these frequent itemsets are used for hypergraph clustering this will create an extremely dense hypergraph and s the hypergraph-based clustering algorithm becomes computationally intractable In the authors have used a higher minimum support threshold i.e 3 for their experiments and obtained 19,602 frequent itemsets covering 440 items A hypergraph consisting of 440 vertices and 19,602 hyperedges was then constructed and 40 partitions were generated Out of 40 partitions 16 of them are clean clusters as they contain stocks primarily from the same or closely related industry groups Table 5 Number of frequent patterns Support No of frequent patterns items covered 3 19602 440 2 149215 734 1 11486914 915 With hyperclique patterns we can construct hypergraphs at any support threshold and thus covering more items r instance with a minimum h-con\223dence threshold 20 and a support threshold 0 we obtain 11,207 hyperclique patterns covering 861 items A hypergraph consisting of 861 vertices and 11,207 hyperedges is then constructed and partitioned into smaller clusters For comparison purposes we partitioned the hypergraph into 80 partitions to ensure that the average size of clusters is almost the same as the average size of the 40 clusters obtained using frequent patterns Note that for both approaches we only use patterns containing two or more items as hyperedges Our experimental results suggest that the hyperclique pattern approach can systematically produce better clustering results than the frequent pattern approach First many items with low levels of support are not included in the frequent pattern approach Speci\223cally there are 421 items covered by hyperclique pattern based clusters that are not covered by frequent pattern based clusters Second the hypergraph clustering algorithm can produce a larger fraction of clean clusters using hyperclique patterns than frequent patterns 204 1 out of 80 partitions versus 16 out of 40 partitions Third all the clean clusters identi\223ed by the frequent pattern approach were also present in the results by the hyperclique pattern approach Finally for the same clean cluster identi\223ed by both approaches there are more same category items included by the hyperclique based approach Table 6 shows some of the clean hyperclique pattern based clusters that appear at low levels of support around 1 support Such clusters could not be identi\223ed by the frequent pattern approach As the table shows our hyperclique pattern approach was able to discover retail chemical  health-product power and communication clusters A complete list of clusters is given n Technical Report We have also applied the graph-partitioning scheme in CLUTO 2  This algorithm takes the adjacency matrix of the similarity graph between the n objects to be clustered as input The experiment results indicate that this approach can produce much worse clustering results than the hypercliquebased approach r instance out of the 80 clusters derived 2 http://www.cs.umn.edu 000 karypis/cluto/index.html Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

Texas Utilities 000 Power by CLUTO less than 30 of them are clean clusters This result is not surprising since the graph-partitioning scheme considers only information about pairs of items but not higher order interactions In addition we also applied the improved version of the k-means clustering algorithm in CLUTO When using cosine as the similarity measure we were able to identify 36 clean clusters out of 80 clusters which is worse than the hyperclique pattern approach Finally we observed the following effects of the hyperclique-based clustering approach If we set the minimum support threshold to 0 and h-con\223dence threshold to 20 the discovered hyperclique patterns cover 861 items Since there are 932 items in total the hyperclique pattern mining algorithm must have eliminated 71 items We amine the distribution of these 71 items in the CLUTO means clustering results We observe that 68 of the items are assigned to the wrong clusters by CLUTO As a result we believe that the items not covered by these hyperclique patterns are potentially noise items 6 Conclusions In this paper e formalized the problem of mining perclique patterns in data sets with skewed support distribution We also introduced the concept of cross-support property and showed how this property can be used to avoid generating spurious patterns involving items from different support levels Furthermore a ew algorithm called hyperclique miner was eveloped This algorithm utilizes crosssupport and anti-monotone properties of h-con\223dence for the ef\223cient discovery of hyperclique patterns Finally we demonstrated applications of hyperclique patterns for discovering strong af\223nity patterns among low-support items and for hyperclique-based item clustering For future work there is a potential for using the hyperclique concept in a variety of applications such as dimensionality reduction copy detection and collaborative 223ltering Also it is valuable to exploit the 000\001 002\003\003 003\004\005\005\002\001 006 property on some other interestingness measures Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by NASA grant  NCC 2 1231 NSF grant  ACI-9982274 DOE contract

of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database dep enden t and th us p ossibly cannot b e gathered at query time An additional pro cess needs to b e completed to gather those v ariables b efore actual computations can b egin 5  9 Optimization Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e will b e the one sho wn in ligh ter dashed lines in gure 11 and the no des under this line will b e the large item sets Notice that no ww eha v eto discard no des ad 2 0 and d 0 2 to o This raises the question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een computed and th us pushing selection conditions inside aggregate op erator ma y b ecome non-trivial Sp ecial data structures and indexes ma y also aid in dev eloping faster metho ds to compute ecien t interse ction joins that w e ha v e utilized in this pap er W e lea v e these questions as op en issues that should be tak en up in the future F ortunately though there has been a v ast b o dy of researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e establish the equiv alence of declarativ e and pro cedural seman tics of the system F ortunately  w e ha v e n umerous pro cedural metho ds for computing asso ciation rules whic h complemen t eac h other in terms of sp eed and database instances In fact that is what declarativ e systems or declarativit y buy us  a c hoice for the most ecien t and accurate pro cessing p ossible 10 Conclusion Our primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or mac hinery  and that w e can no wha v ea v ery in tuitiv e and simple program to do so W eha v esho wn that it is indeed p ossible to mine declarativ ekno wledge b y exploiting the existing mac hinery supp orted b ycon temp orary inference engines in programming languages e.g Prolog or kno wledge base systems e.g RelationLog XSB LD L  CORAL All w e require is that the engine b e able to supp ort set v alued terms grouping aggregate functions and set relational op erators for comparison functionalities whic hmostofthesesystemscurren tly supp ort W e ha v e also demonstrated that our formalism is grounded on a more mathematical foundation with formal prop erties on whic h the seman tics of the R ULES system rely  W e ha v e also raised sev eral op en issues related to eciency and query optimization whic h should b e our next order of business As future researc h w e plan to dev elop optimization tec hniques for mining queries that require non-trivial lo ok ahead and pruning tec hniques in aggregate functions The dev elopmen ts presen ted here also ha v e other signican t implications F or example it is no w p ossible to compute c hi square rules 4 using the building blo c ks pro vided b y our system Declarativ e computation of c hi square rules to our kno wledge has nev er b een attempted for the man y pro cedural concepts the computation of c hi square metho d relies on In a separate w ork 2 w e sho w that the coun ting metho d prop osed in this pap er can be eectiv ely utilized to generate the exp ectations needed in order to compute suc h rules rather easily  These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful and feasible to ol for the analysis of business data in relational databases suc htec hnology m ust b e made a v ailable as part of database engines and as part of its declarativ e query language Our prop osal for declarativ e mining bears merit since it sheds ligh t on ho w rst order databases can be mined in a declarativ e and pro cedure indep enden t w a y so that the optimization issues can b e delegated to the underlying database engine Once suc h argumen ts are accepted sev eral systems 9 


related issues b ecome prime candidates for immediate atten tion F or example traditionally database systems supp orted declarativ e querying without the necessit y to care ab out the pro ceduralit y of the queries In this pap er w eha v e actually demonstrated that asso ciation rule mining can b e view ed as a Datalog query  It is immediate that a direct mapping from the Datalog expressions presen ted in this pap er to SQL can be dev elop ed with no problem at all W e can then rely on ecien t database pro cessing of the query in an optimized fashion Hence w ecomeclose to the essence of the visions expressed b y the leading database researc hers and practioners 12  References 1 Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srik an t F ast algorithms for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In VLDB  pages 487{499 1994 2 Anon ymous A declarativ e metho d for mining c hisquare rules from deductiv e databases T ec hnical rep ort Departmen t of Computer Science Anon ymous Univ ersit y USA F ebruary 2001 3 C Beeri and R Ramakrishnan On the po w er of magic In Pr o c e e dings of the 6th A CM Symp osium on Principles of Datab ase Systems  pages 269{283 1987 4 Sergey Brin Ra jeev Mot w ani and Craig Silv erstein Bey ond mark et bask ets Generalizing asso ciation rules to correlations In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 265 276 1997 5 D Chimen ti et al The LD L system protot yp e IEEE Journal on Data and Know le dge Engine ering  2\(1 90 1990 6 Jia w ei Han Jian P ei and Yiw en Yin Mining frequen t patterns without candidate generation In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 1{12 2000 7 Marcel Holsheimer Martin L Kersten Heikki Mannila and Hann uT oiv onen A p ersp ectiv e on databases and data mining In Pr o c of the sixth A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  pages 150{155 Mon treal Queb ec 1995 8 Flip Korn Alexandros Labrinidis Y annis Kotidis and Christos F aloutsos Ratio rules A new paradigm for fast quan tiable data mining In Pr o c of 24th VLDB  pages 582{593 1998 9 Brian Len t Arun N Sw ami and Jennifer Widom Clustering asso ciation rules In Pr o c of the 3th ICDE  pages 220{231 1997 10 Mengc hi Liu Relationlog At yp ed extension to datalog with sets and tuples In John Llo yd editor Pr oc e e dings of the 12th International L o gic Pr o gr amming Symp osium  pages 83{97 P ortland Oregon Decem ber 1995 MIT Press 11 Rosa Meo Giusepp e Psaila and Stefano Ceri An extension to SQL for mining asso ciation rules Data Mining and Know le dge Disc overy  2\(2 1998 12 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Je Bernhardt and Usama M F a yy ad In tegration of data mining with database tec hnology  In Pr o c e e dings of 26th VLDB  pages 719{722 2000 13 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Usama M F a yy ad and Je Bernhardt In tegrating data mining with SQL databases In IEEE ICDE  2001 14 Ra ymond T Ng Laks V S Lakshmanan Jia w ei Han and Alex P ang Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 13{24 1998 15 Jong So o P ark Ming-Sy an Chen and Philip S Y u An eectiv e hash based algorithm for mining asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 175{186 1995 16 Karthic k Ra jamani Alan Co x Bala Iy er and A tul Chadha Ecien t mining for asso ciation rules with relational database systems In Pr o c e e dings of the International Datab ase Engine ering and Applic ations Symp osium  pages 148{155 1999 17 R Ramakrishnan D Sriv asta v a and S Sudarshan CORAL  Con trol Relations and Logic In Pr o c of 18th VLDB Confer enc e  pages 238{250 1992 18 Konstan tinos F Sagonas T errance Swift and Da vid Scott W arren XSB as an ecien t deductiv e database engine In Pr o c of the A CM SIGMOD Intl Conf  pages 442{453 1994 19 Sunita Sara w agi Shib y Thomas and Rak esh Agra w al In tegrating mining with relational database systems Alternativ es and implications In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 343{354 1998 20 Ashok a Sa v asere Edw ard Omiecinski and Shamk an tB Nav athe An ecien t algorithm for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In Pr o c of 21th VLDB  pages 432{444 1995 21 Pradeep Sheno y  Ja y an t R Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaura v Bhalotia Ma y ank Ba w a and Dev a vrat Shah T urb o-c harging v ertical mining of large databases In A CM SIGMOD  pages 22{33 2000 22 Abraham Silb ersc hatz Henry F Korth and S Sudarshan Datab ase System Conc epts  McGra w-Hill third edition 1996 23 Shib y Thomas and Sunita Sara w agi Mining generalized asso ciation rules and sequen tial patterns using SQL queries In KDD  pages 344{348 1998 24 J D Ullman Principles of Datab ase and Know le dgeb ase Systems Part I II  Computer Science Press 1988 25 Mohammed J Zaki Generating non-redundan t association rules In Pr o c of the 6th A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  Boston MA August 2000 1 0
