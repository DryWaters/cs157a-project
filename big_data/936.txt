loop nest corresponds to a node in the iteration space and is identied by its index vector  p  p 1 p 2   p n   p i is the loop index of the i loop in the nest counting from the outermost to innermost loop Deﬁnition 2 Let n be the depth of a loop nest and d be the dimensions of an array A Two references A   f   i  and A   g   i   where  f and  g are indexing functions Z n  Z d  are called uniformly generated if  f   i  H  i   c f and  g   i  H  i   c g where H is a linear transformation and  c f and  c g are constant vectors Wolf classied the data reuse into four classes selftemporal reuse self-spatial reuse group-temporal reuse and group-spatial reuse If a reference within a loop nest accesses the same data location in different iterations a self-temporal reuse happens And if the reference accesses data on the same cache line in different iterations it is said to possess self-spatial reuse Furthermore different references may access the same locations So we can get the group-temporal reuse and group-spatial reuse  Self-Temporal Reuse Self-temporal reuse happens when a reference A  H  i   c  accesses the same data element in iteration  i 1 and  i 2  whenever H  i 1   c  H  i 2   c  If  r   i 1   i 2 is the reuse vector the solution of the equation H  i 1   c  H  i 2   c is ker H  a subspace in the iteration space This is the self-temporal reuse vector space R ST  Thus R ST ker H  Self-Spatial Reuse All but the row index must be identical for a reference A  H  i   c  to possess self-spatial reuse Let H S be H with all elements of the last row replaced by 0 The self-spatial reuse vector space is simply R SS ker H S  Group-Temporal Reuse Two distinct references A  H  i   c 1  and A  H  i   c 2  have group temporal reuse if and only if H r   c 1   c 2  where  r   i 1   i 2 If  r p is a particular solution of the equation the general solution is ker H   r p  In general the group-temporal reuse vector R GT for a uniformly generated set with references A  H  i   c 1    A  H  i   c g  is dened to be R GT  span   r 2    r g  ker H where for k 2   g   r k is a particular solution of H r   c 1   c k   Group-Spatial Reuse Similar to the self-spatial reuse let H S be H with all elements of the last row replaced by 0 The group-spatial reuse vector space is R GS  span   r 2    r g  ker H S  self / group temporal / spatial i nt r a  i nt er pr o ce ss o r Figure 1 Data reuse categories for parallel programs for i 1 0 i 1 4 i 1  for i 2 0 i 2 4 i 2  c i 1 a i 1  i 2   i 2   Figure 2 Code segment of matrix vector multiplication where k 2   g   r k is a particular solution of H r   c S 1   c S,k   c S,i is the vector replacing the last row of  c i by 0 3 Parallel Data Reuse Theory Different from the one in serial programs a data reuse in parallel programs may be either an intra-processor reuse or an inter-processor reuse So we can classify data reuse in parallel programs according to Fig 1 The sharing property of data in parallel programs is very important and the relationship between parallel data reuse and sharing property is shown in TABLE 1 3.1 Iteration-Distinguished Reuse Theory Before studying the parallel data reuse theory we study the iteration-distinguished data reuse theory rstly The intra-processor class and inter-processor class of data reuse depend not only on the intra-iteration/inter-iteration relationship but also on the scheduling of the threads So in this section we discuss the intra-iteration/inter-iteration reuse namely iteration-distinguished data reuse theory Fig 2 shows a code segment of matrix vector multiplication in C language If we parallelize the outermost loop level the loop nest will be divided into four parallelized loop nests as shown in Fig 3 i p 1  i p 2 1 Given a parallelized loop nest of index vector  i  which one in Fig 3 it belongs is only determined by i 1  In general index vector  i 1 and  i 2 belong to the same parallelized loop nest if and only if i p 1  i p 2  where the p th level of the loop nest is parallelized

 10 data obtained from the industrial motor test setup. Data was acquired using the experimental fault profile in Figure 15. A snapshot of raw data, including the calculated feature values, is provided in Figure 16 Anomaly Detection\227 The particle filter framework was integrated into LabVIEW to evaluate the real-time performance of the anomaly detector during data acquisition. Shown in Figure 17 is a GUI developed in LabVIEW to manage the anomaly detector settings which include the false alarm rate \(type I error\and false alarm threshold \(type II error  Addi t i onal  confi gurat i on settings include the number of particles used by the particle filter, baseline statistics, fault model, and particle filter update / sample time The results from anomaly detector, using the data shown previously in Figure 16, are provided in Figure 18. The green line represents the confidence of detection based on the false alarm rate and the red line represents the alarm, or detection, threshold as defined earlier in Figure 17. The red dot designates the crossing point during which the red health-state light illuminates to indicate an anomaly has occurred 6  C ONCLUSION  This paper presented a particle-filter based anomaly detector capable of detecting the occurre nce of a major fault mode in its incipient stages for a safe ty critical aircraft actuation system. An overview of a ge neric PHM architecture were presented and applied to a particular EMA fault mode based on an internal FMEA study. The fault mode investigated in detail was a turn-to-turn winding insulation short for a brushless DC motor. The primary fault mode was modeled using physics-of-failure mechan isms indicating the primary failure effect, phase current asymmetry. A feature was derived using a Hilbert transform and statistical analysis to quantify the primary failure eff ect. Then, experimental data was acquired to validate the Simulink simulation model Finally, real-time evaluation of the anomaly detector was performed using LabVIEW  Although a specific system, an EMA, was selected as the test-platform with a specific fault mode, the overall PHM architecture can be applied to an entire range of systems and application domains. In fact, similar techniques which allow  Figure 16\227Plots of experimental data \(top computed features \(bottom experimental test setup using LabVIEW  Figure 17\227LabVIEW interface used to define particle filter settings Figure 18\227Plot of anomaly detection confidence \(top and health state indicator \(bottom\the experimental test setup using LabVIEW 


 11 for early fault detection dur ing acceptable performance in the presence of faults are being developed for a wide variety of system in both manned and unmanned air vehicles Therefore, the concept of usi ng system health information diagnosis and prognosis\n conjunction with reconfigurable control is at the forefront of modern space and avionics applications requiring increasingly sophisticated fault-tolerant systems that are robust, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Ther efore the need arises for a fault-tolerant control architecture to further maximize performance and extend the operating life of COTS components in future avionics systems A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was performed under the United States Air Force USAF\contract number FA8650-06-C-7628.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
