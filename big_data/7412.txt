multiplicatively it affects only scaling and hence with little loss in generality we choose  To explore this we allow two targets to 322approach\323 one another from opposite ends of the resolution

entry of the inverse of the Fisher information matrix the same plots and parameters persist except here the pulse shape is Gaussian with 95 of its energy in a 1000 m swath For range resolution it appears that while the Gaussian pulse exhibits a 322\337oor\323 below which 336ner matched 336ltering sampling offers no improvement the rectangular pulse appears to continue to improve as matched 336lter sampling effort increases This is a manifestation of the Nyquist rate and the bandwidth for the two signals since the rectangular pulse is sharp detailed range information is obtainable from looking for its peaks with increasing closeness In fact the rectangular pulse may not be realistic given the bandwidth constraints of a practical radar system we do not continue with the rectangular pulse In Figure 3 we also plot some results of likelihood maximization according to and it appears that the CRLB is a reasonable proxy for obtainable estimation accuracy It is interesting that there appears to be no reason for 336ner sampling than approximately twice as often as would be suggested by the pulse length In Figure 5 we show the case for targets that are further separated than in Figure 4 Remarkably it appears that the performance is somewhat worse indicating that there is some mutual bene\336t to the targets\325 proximity close targets can be better estimated than ones far away from each other The CRLB also provides information on estimation crosscovariance in the off-diagonal terms of  4  R  m n J  1 exists then it achieves the CRLB asymptotically From among others the result is widely available we have for the  We also see that all results can be taken relative to the pulse length for example if the error is 50 m with a pulse length of 1000 m then a pulse length of 100 m would yield an accuracy of 5 m Finally when we discuss accuracy we primarily explore the case of two targets only In Figure 3 we plot the CRLB 4 for range and for electronic angle using a 1000 m rectangular pulse i.e and matched 336lter sample  Figure 6 shows correlations between each target\325s estimates that is between either of the target\325s azimuth and elevation estimates and between its azimuth and range estimates and the strength of these correlations is surprising That the azimuth and elevation angular estimates for a single target should be correlated was observed in b ut it is interesting here to see that as two targets coalesce the correlation becomes greater still According to crosscorrelations between angles and ranges i.e between the angle estimate for one target and that for the other and correspondingly for the ranges are fairly light In Figure 7 we hold the matched 336ltering effort and target type 336xed 320 two 30dB targets separated by 10 m and matched 336lter samples taken every 100 m 320 and vary the pulse both its type and its length When the pulse length matches the sampling effort 100 m it appears that in terms of range estimation most pulses are equivalent On the other hand when the pulses are long the higher-bandwidth binary phase-coded pulse Barker is better  Ho we v er  it is interesting that the angle-estimation performance of all waveforms bene\336ts from a lower-bandwidth pulse as is clear from the left panel of Figure 7 Note that the raised cosine pulse exhibits poor range estimation when the pulse length is equal to the sampling interval detailed investigation has shown that this is caused by cases in which the targets are close to the matched 336lter sampling points 320 the raised cosine\325s excessive 337atness 3 P

   by a more powerful and presumably more estimable second target and while there is some loss in the quality of the target RCS estimate this loss appears negligible It would appear from these 336gures that there is little cost associated with estimation of the SNRs Unfortunately we also have Figure 12 showing the relative CRLBs for location as a function of the number of targets between two matched 336lter sampling points and to be compared to Figure 8 Apparently the need to estimate targets\325 SNRs requires its price paid in terms of the number of targets that can be estimated for

estimable 320 this is as reported in W e also see that there is a considerable degradation in performance when one attempts to estimate the locations of this many targets 336ve targets is clearly on the edge of estimability If the sampling rate is twice the pulse length oversampling by a factor of two then it would appear that up to nine targets are estimable via a rectangular pulse 320 oversampling was not explored in Indeed this number stretches to the mid teens if the oversampling factor is again doubled to four although the quality of these estimates makes them questionable We also 336nd perhaps surprisingly that the smooth raised-cosine pulse is apparently much more effective at delivering multiple targets\325 estimates than is the rectangular pulse at least when the matched 336lter is oversampled The CRLB can also be used to predict estimability for cases in which the targets stretch over a range swath that exceeds a single pulse length The results are less easy to plot but it is found with targets distributed in a range as long as two pulse lengths that up to 336ve targets in the 336rst length bin or up to 336ve in the second but not both That is with numbers indicating the quantities of targets estimable in the 336rst and second bins 5,4 is possible as is 4,5 but 5,5 is not In fact this exceeds the results of which conserv ati v ely showed that 4,4 was the most targets that could be localized being the number of targets the FIM i  4   0   inhibits good range estimation in these cases and these cases tend to dominate the averaged CRLBs A singular CRLB means that estimation is not possible In Figure 8 we show the largest diagonal element of the CRLB plotted against number of targets and for various combinations of signal types and sampling rates for example 322rcos/4\323 means that Reference assumed that all tar get radar cross sections i.e SNRs are known and for the most part they were assumed equal too While it is not unreasonable to estimate or track these there are many cases in which the target SNRs cannot be reliably known a-priori In this section we explore the impact of unknown SNR by assuming that the parameters to be estimated 320 nominally target range azimuthand elevation-angles to this point 320 are augmented by SNRs everything is estimated In fact the CRLB expression of 10 is general enough to accommodate this new model but instead of estimating In the previous analysis we have assumed that the sumchannel power observed by the radar is independent of the target\325s bearing as long as the target is within the beam However real radar antennas do have a response pattern As such let us now modify 2 to 11 in which  denotes the effect of the two-way transmit and receive antenna pattern for

respectively in angle and in range for the case that the target SNRs must be estimated The left parts of these 336gures are directly comparable with Figure 5 there is clearly some loss from the need to estimate the SNR but that loss is manageable Figure 11 shows the CRLB for estimation of the target SNR and these given that they are based on a single pulse seem appropriately large The left parts of Figures 9 10 and 11 show the case that the true SNRs of the two targets are identical the right parts present the case that the SNR of target two is ten times that of target one 320 recall that the CRLBs of the 336rst target are in all cases those reported It is interesting that the localization for the 336rst target is actually 4 can be estimated if the SNR is unknown rather than         336ve

we expect that the most signi\336cant improvements will be observed for unknown SNR since the beampattern information is strongest in its effect on return amplitude but these results are most comparable with the extensive ones presented earlier in section 4 In Figure 13 we show the CRLBs for range and angle with beampattern considered 320 to be compared to Figure 5 no beampattern 320 and there appears to be little difference Comparing Figure 14 to Figure 8 320 describing estimation bounds on number of targets respectively with and without beampattern considered 320 we again 336nd little improvement although with matched 336lter samples taken one pulse length apart it now appears that 336ve targets is more a matter of course For the case that targets are distributed among two pulse lengths the critical operating points remain 5,4 and 4,5 Unknown Target Strengths We next examine the case that target strengths are unknown and must be estimated can knowledge of the beampattern help here It turns out that in terms of estimation of location i.e range and angle there is little difference the plots look very similar to those in Figures 9 and 10 However when the targets\325 SNRs are estimated we get Figure 15 and it appears that there is almost a factor of two improvement in SNR estimation when there is beampattern information Since target strengths are necessary to discern the number of targets we expect better results in this also Comparing Figure 16 to Figure 12 we 336nd that with beampattern effects considered a rectangular pulse can extract four targets rather than three  with matched 336lter samples every pulse length and likewise a more-reliable seven targets with double the sampling effort For the case that targets are distributed among two pulse lengths the critical operating points are now 4,3 and 3,4 as opposed to 3,3 when the beampattern is uniform and ignored 7 C ONCLUSIONS It has recently become clear that by consideration of the likelihood function of multiple matched 336lter samples in a joint fashion it is possible to extract and localize a suprising number of closely spaced targets using monopulse observations For example it had been found that 336ve targets could be distinguished from among two matched 336lter samples taken one pulse length apart Viewing monopulse returns from a purely statistical perspective 320 as opposed to con\336ning attention to the real part of the monopulse ratio 320 appears promising and it seems worthwhile to ask its limits The natural vehicle for limits is the CRLB There have been numerous treatments of the CRLB for monopulse data but few have focused on the multiple target case nor the realistic case that all that is available is sampled matched 336lter data as opposed to waveform returns In this paper we have developed an exact simple expression for the CRLB for sampled monopulse radar and we have interrogated it for many multitarget cases of interest Generally the results depend on true target locations and we have averaged over these in the Monte Carlo sense Among our 336ndings we have cos  2 2 4 2 2 4 2 2 4 2 k ak da k k ek de 1 1 1     16   17  245 For a smooth basic radar pulse there can be improvement for 336ne matched 336lter sampling as opposed to the standard once-per-pulse-length sampling strategy Note that with such 336ne sampling the thermal noise becomes correlated and our analysis incorporates this 245 For a rectangular pulse this trend of improvement does not appear to end presumably due to its large bandwidth In practice a perfect rectangular pulse is not achievable 245 When targets are close their estimates are bound to be correlated and we have quanti\336ed this for the case of two targets We 336nd that results depend both on proximity and SNR It appears that the appearance of a second target can signi\336cantly increase dependence among a given target\325s estimated parameters but that the correlation between targets is light 245 Taking the Barker-7 pulse rectangular subpulses as a proxy for coded pulses it appears that while the 322thumbtack\323 ambiguity function is appealing that even with optimal likelihood function processing coded high-bandwidth waveforms do offer some improvement in range resolution However it appears that such waveforms can affect angular estimation quite negatively in the multiple target situation 245 While it is con\336rmed that 336ve targets can be isolated within two pulse lengths when matched 336lter samples are taken one pulse length apart it appears that many more are isolatable for 336ner sampling For example with double the matched 336lter sampling effort and a rectangular pulse up to nine targets appear resolvable and even more with a smoother pulse 245 When the
