Previous methods of deceleration are not\nscalable for exploration type vehicles which can potentially\nweigh tens of metric tons. Since ground and flight testing of\nSRP at entry conditions can be difficult and cost-prohibitive,\nthe development of this enabling technology can be enhanced\nwith the ability to predict the flowfield numerically using\nComputational Fluid Dynamics \(CFD results in a complex flow structure involving shocks,\nshear layers, recirculation and stagnation regions which\nmakes validation of the CFD methods a high priority. The\nvalidation process includes using multiple CFD codes to com-\npare to historical and recent wind tunnel tests. Three CFD\ncodes are being applied to SRP: DPLR Data Parallel Line\nRelaxation  Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes\nThree-Dimensional   OVERFLOW \(OVERset\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.\n1 IEEEAC Paper #2103, Version 1 Updated 17/10/2012.\ngrid FLOW solver  implementation, grid type,\nand numerical methods. Through code-to-code and code-to-\ntest comparisons, best practices in grid generation, numerical\nmethod selection, and solution advancement are established,\nand validity is added to the CFD methods. With continuing\nvalidation, confidence is built for using CFD to predict Mars\nentry conditions.\nCFD validation efforts for SRP were conducted under the\nNASA Exploration Technology Development Program. The\nCFD solvers were applied [8] to a historical [7] and a more\nrecent [36] wind tunnel test. Although much was learned\nthrough the exercise, the historical test reports lacked key\ninformation for CFD validation. A wind tunnel test was then\nconducted for the purpose of CFD validation in the Langley\nResearch Center supersonic 4?×4? Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel\n\(LRC UPWT  aided by CFD\n[12] [13]. Through results from the test, the CFD best prac-\ntices were established [15] and an extensive comparison study\nwas conducted [16]. The study yielded promising results,\nbut not all conditions were properly predicted consistently\nbetween the CFD codes. To further the validation exercise,\nand to obtain higher and more flight-relevant thrust levels, the\nsame model was tested in the NASA Ames Research Center\n9?×7? Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel \(ARC UPWT study. A subset\nof the study can be found in reference [17], upon which this\npaper builds.\nQualitative comparisons of the flow structure will be made\nby comparing CFD to high-speed shadowgraph images and\nquantitative comparisons will be made by comparing aver-\naged surface pressure with pressure tap data from the tunnel.\nHigh frequency pressure transducer data are also available,\nand have been studied more thoroughly for the LRC UPWT\ntest [37] than for the ARC UPWT test. Comparisons of\ndominant frequencies of certain runs were discussed in ref-\nerences [15] and [17]. Neither test used a balance system, so\nforces and moments were not measured. However, code-to-\ncode comparisons of forces and moments were included in\nreferences [16] and 17].\nThis paper will first introduce the SRP flow structure, the\nCFD solvers, and the ARC UPWT test. It will then dis-\ncuss the different modes the SRP flow structure experiences\ndepending on nozzle configuration thrust level, angle of\nattack, and Mach number. Then CFD results are compared\nto tunnel data, and strengths and weaknesses of the solvers\nare discussed.\n1\n2. SRP FLOW STRUCTURE\nFigure 1 shows a CFD simulation of a run from the Daso, et\nal. wind tunnel test [36] to represent the SRP flow structure.\nIn a supersonic freestream, a 


bow shock forms around the\nmodel, which is an Apollo capsule with an embedded sonic\nnozzle. As an opposing jet is initiated, the bow shock is\npushed upstream as the apparent body frontal area is in-\ncreased with the appearance of a barrel plume. The barrel\nplume contains free shear layers as well as a terminal shock.\nBetween the terminal and bow shocks is an interface or\ncontact surface where opposing streams stagnate. With the\nbarrel plume, recirculation regions appear as well as a triple\npoint, where three types of flow meet supersonic jet flow,\nsubsonic post-shock jet flow, and subsonic recirculating flow.\nThe term “triple point has a two-dimensional sense to it, in\nthree dimensions it is an annular ring.\nThis is an example of 1-nozzle SRP flow at a relatively high\nthrust level. Other modes exist depending on the jet-to-\nfreestream pressure ratios, including a long-jet penetration\nmode at low pressure ratios [7]. Even other modes exist\nand can vary according to thrust level, angles of attack,\nand multiple nozzle configurations where plume-to-plume\ninteractions may exist.\n3. DESCRIPTION OF CFD SOLVERS\nThe three solvers applied to the SRP problem differ in\nimplementation, grid type, and numerical methods. DPLR\nand FUN3D are finite-volume while OVERFLOW is finite-\ndifference. DPLR uses cell-centered structured overset grids,\nwhile OVERFLOW uses node-centered structured overset\ngrids. FUN3D employs node-centered unstructured grids.\nWith these differences between codes, much is to be learned\nthrough code-to-code comparison when applying them to a\nsingle set of problems.\nIn reference [15], grid and time resolution, observed order\nof accuracy, and the establishment of best practices are de-\nscribed in detail. The best practices were established through\nCFD sensitivity studies being applied to a 1-nozzle case from\nthe LRC UPWT test. The following are brief descriptions of\neach code including the numerical methods used by each in\nthis study.\nDPLR\nThe DPLR CFD code is a parallel, structured multi-block,\nfinite-volume code with overset grid capability that solves\nthe Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes RANS present study, the thermally- and\ncalorically-perfect RANS equations for air are solved implic-\nitly with 1st-order time accuracy.

The viscous terms are\ncomputed with a 2nd-order spatial accuracy central difference\napproach. For the present analysis, Menter’s Shear-Stress\nTransport \(SST 24] was employed with\na vorticity-based production term and no compressibility\ncorrections.\nFUN3D\nFUN3D contains a node-based finite-volume unstructured\nflow solver.

The\ncalculation of the inviscid fluxes for both the flow solver\nand the turbulence model use 3rd-order accurate MUSCL\nreconstruction and 2nd-order flux quadrature.\n4. SRP WIND TUNNEL TEST\nTest 234 in the ARC UPWT was designed specifically for\nSRP CFD validation and was a follow-on to test 1853 of the\nLRC UPWT. The reason for the ARC UPWT test was to use\nthe same model from the previous test in a larger test section\nto be able to obtain higher and more flight-relevant thrust\ncoefficients \(CT T/\(qA included four\nnozzles which could be plugged to offer 0-, 1-, 3-, or 4-nozzle\nconfigurations. One nozzle was located at the center of the\nforebody, and the three others were oriented radially every\n120? at the model’s 1/2 radius. Air was used as both the\nfreestream and jet gases. The test data included high speed\nshadowgraph movies \(5-10 thousand frames per second transducers. From these data, qualitative comparisons\nwith CFD flow structure and unsteady behavior can be made\nwith the shadowgraph movies, as well as averaged surface\npressure comparisons with the pressure taps.\nThe test run matrix included four nozzle configurations: 0, 1\n\(center peripheral center and peripheral million, and for Mach\n2.4, 1 and 1.5 million were tested. The total freestream\ntemperature for Mach 1.8 was 


550? Rankine, and for Mach\n2.4 was 555? Rankine. For angles of orientation, ? ranged\nfrom -8? to 20? and ranged from 0? to 12?. Thrust\ncoefficients ranged from 0 to 10 in increments of 2. To\nmitigate liquefaction the jet air supply was heated to 150?\nF; however, evidence of some liquefaction was noted at high\nthrust levels. A full description of the test can be found in\nreference [20]. Figure 2 is a snapshot of the model in the 1-\nnozzle configuration in the test section. Figure 3 is a sketch\nof the wind tunnel test section with the model installed, and\nincludes the coordinate system [20]. Figure 4 shows diagrams\nof the model face and side-body pressure tap layouts [19].\nTunnel uncertainty will not be included in this paper since\ncalculations are still underway, but will be carried out with\nthe same method as the LRC UPWT test [19] as described in\nreference [9].\nFigure 2.

SRP FLOW STRUCTURE MODES\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the different modes\nthat exist for SRP when varying Mach number, the number of\njets, the levels of thrust, and the angle of orientation, and how\nwell CFD can match those modes in behavior and in average\nsurface pressure. SRP literature shows that different modes\nexist for the 1-nozzle configuration depending on the jet-to-\nfreestream pressure ratio [7], [36]. At low ratios, a long-jet\npenetration mode exists where the jet exhaust is unsteady,\nsimilar to a candle flame, and the bow shock has a large and\nfluctuating standoff distance from the model. At higher ratios,\nthe short-penetration mode exists \(described in Section 2 distance than the long-jet penetration mode.\nIt was observed in the LRC UPWT test that once in the short-\npenetration mode, unsteadiness in the triple point can vary\nbetween a periodic oscillation and a smaller scale aperiodic\nfluctuation. Also, as angle of attack increases, the windward\ntriple point oscillations become larger as the leeward triple\npoint oscillations decrease, then for ? = 20? the steadiness\nof the shock structure was lost as the barrel plume and bow\nshock fluctuated chaotically. The CFD solvers did well\nsimulating the 1-nozzle cases of the LRC UPWT test in\nbehavior and in matching the average surface pressure, with a\ntrend that DPLR predicted a steadier flowfield than was seen\nin the test, and FUN3D and OVERFLOW well predicted the\nunsteady behavior seen in the test. The different levels of\npredicted unsteadiness in the codes is attributed to turbulence\nmodeling and grid resolution [15], [16].\nMore observations from the LRC UPWT test showed that\nfor the 3-nozzle configuration at lower thrust coefficients\n 3 qualitative\ncomparisons of the shock structure behavior, and varying\nsuccess was obtained when comparing to the average surface\npressure. Discrepancies between the codes and test data at\nthe model nose and shoulder implied a difference in how\nthe codes were simulating the jet-to-jet interaction and the\nunsteady bow shock shedding and how those impacted the\nmodel face. A large discrepancy in data acquisition rates did\nexist between the CFD and wind tunnel test \(WTT CFD simulations. An entire CFD run could fit within\nthe time between two pressure tap readings, meaning high\nfrequency fluctuations captured by the CFD codes were not\ncaptured by the WTT system, and the low frequency fluc-\ntuations captured by the WTT system were not captured by\nthe CFD. This introduced an error source that increased when\nunsteady frequencies became very high or very low. A few\nruns at zero angles of attack and CT up to six showed that\nthe bow shock became nearly steady as jet-to-jet interactions\ndecreased due to distinctly defined barrel plumes. The more\nsteady flowfield was desirable for vehicle stability, and this\nhelped build the case for the ARC UPWT test where higher\nthrust was possible. As explained in reference 17], at higher\nthrust for the 3-nozzle configuration \(? 6 steadier and the CFD compared\nbetter qualitatively and quantitatively than for the lower thrust\ncases from the LRC UPWT test.\nFor the 4-nozzle configuration, the LRC UPWT test showed a\nshort-penetration bow shock behavior at zero angle of attack.\nA discrepancy between the CFD codes for this behavior\nwas noted. Runs 307 and 311 were the same in Mach\nnumber \(4.6 2 respectively. The test showed\nthe same short-penetration shock behavior for both runs,\nbut DPLR showed a larger standoff distance for run 307,\nand OVERFLOW showed a larger and fluctuating standoff\ndistance for run 311. This implied a difference in modes\nfor the 4-nozzle configuration, and the boundary between\nthe modes was not well defined by the CFD codes. As\ndiscussed in [17], at higher thrust coefficients, the 4-nozzle\nconfiguration did demonstrate a large and fluctuating bow\nshock standoff distance, and became chaotically unsteady. In\nthe LRC UPWT test, it was shown that for a roll angle of\n0?, unsteadiness increased 


with angle of attack. For a roll\nangle of 180?, angle of attack 12? was unsteady while angle\nof attack 20 settled into a steadier mode. All these behaviors\nwere simulated well with the CFD solvers with the exception\nat angle of attack 0? already discussed. The average surface\npressures for the LRC UPWT test compared well between the\ncodes for all cases, with the largest discrepancies found at the\nmodel shoulder Similar to the 3-nozzle configuration, the\ndifferences in average CP at the shoulder implies differences\nin simulated bow shock shedding that impacts the model face.\n4\n6. RESULTS\nThe CFD run matrix \(Table 1 of 31 cases varying\nin Mach number, nozzle configuration, thrust coefficient, and\nangles of orientation. All runs in the CFD matrix had a\nReynolds number per foot of 1.5 million with the excep-\ntion of run 223, which had 1.0 million. For the angles of\norientation, most cases vary only in ? angle since the ?\nplane provided better shadowgraph imagery for qualitative\ncomparisons. Runs 279 and 309 included non-zero ? angles\nand were meant to compare total alpha angles \(?T  will\nnow be discussed in more detail. The 0-nozzle configuration\nwill be skipped since it was already covered in reference [17].\nAlso discussed in reference [17] are the effects of the sting on\npressure measurements from the test. The sting caused an\nincrease in the average CP over the aft 30% of the model.\nNone of the CFD simulations in this paper include the sting,\nso will underpredict the average CP in that region.\nAll cases in the run matrix were computed with OVERFLOW,\nwhile a smaller subset was computed with FUN3D and\nDPLR. For the flowfield images, unless otherwise labeled,\nthe CFD solver is OVERFLOW. The line plots in this section\ncompare the average surface pressure from the CFD results\nand the WTT data along ? = 0? and 180? \(see Figure 4 flowfield images are instantaneous, and include surface\npressure variations on the model and visualize the plume-to-\nfreestream interaction with constructed Schlierens or shadow-\ngraphs generated after the manner described in reference [38].\nTable 1.

The CFD matrix focused on\nCT of 4 with runs 106, 116, and 223, and how the behavior\nat that CT varied with Mach number and ? angle. Runs\n101 104, and 112 looked into lower thrust coefficients. All\ncases demonstrated the short-penetration mode described in\nSection 2.\nFigure 5 visualizes the effect of CT as seen in the test and\nhow well the CFD matched that behavior. The increased size\nof the barrel plume was simulated well with OVERFLOW,\nand average surface pressures matched well, but consistently\nunderpredicted in the aft region of the model due to not\nmodeling the sting. For run 104, the average CP was\noverpredicted on the model face, caused by OVERFLOW\npredicting a periodic oscillation of the triple point. Shedding\nfrom the triple point propagates to the model face, which in\nturn affects the CP on the surface. When the shedding is\nperiodic instead of random, the energy is more organized and\nthe average CP increases. Periodic shedding was not seen in\nthe test for this run.\nThe effects of increasing ? angle is shown in Figure 6. As ?\nangle increased, the windward triple point oscillation became\nmore pronounced as the leeward triple point became more\nstationary. This was predicted well by OVERFLOW, and the\naverage surface CP compared well on the model face with\nsome underprediction on the model side. Run 223 ? = 12?\nfrom the ARC UPWT test was similar in triple point behavior\nas run 165 ? = 12? from the LRC UPWT test [15], [16].\nFigure 7 combines the results from all codes and the test for\nrun 223, ? = 0?. The DPLR simulation reached a steady\nstate where FUN3D predicted a periodic oscillation of the\ntriple point, and OVERFLOW predicted the more random\ntriple point oscillation as seen in the test. On the model face,\nall codes overpredicted the average CP near the shoulder,\nwith FUN3D overpredicting the most due to simulating an\norganized shedding from the triple point. Along the model\nside, no significant differences were noted between the codes,\nand all underpredicted towards the aft end of the model due\nto not including the sting in the simulations.\n5\nFigure 5. Effects of CT ; test shadowgraph compared to CFD constructed Schlieren and average surface pressure comparison\nfor the 1-nozzle configuration at Mach 1.8.\nFigure 6. Effects of ?; test shadowgraph compared to CFD constructed Schlieren and average surface pressure comparison\nfor the 1-nozzle configuration, run 223: Mach 2.4, CT 4.\n6\nFigure 7. Code-to-code and code-to-test comparison of Run\n223 1-nozzle, Mach 2.4, CT 4, ? 0?.\nGiven the close comparisons in behavior and in average sur-\nface CP , CFD fairs well for simulating the 1-nozzle configu-\nration. Some differences existed in the level of 


unsteadiness\npredicted by the solvers, which did not significantly affect\ndifferences in the average CP . Two traits of the CFD that did\naffect the comparison to the tunnel data were sting effects and\nincorrectly predicting the triple point behavior.\n3-Nozzle Configuration\nAs discussed in section 5, the higher thrust coefficients tested\nin the ARC UPWT demonstrated steadier flow than the lower\nthrust coefficients seen in the LRC UPWT test. This same\ntrend is also shown in Figure 8 where run 126 was more\nunsteady at a CT of 2 than runs 130 and 132 which were\nat CT s of 6 and 8, respectively. The OVERFLOW results for\nrun 126 differed in behavior and in average surface CP from\nthe test, especially at the model nose. As CT increased the\nsteadiness did as well, as did the agreement with the CFD\nsimulations. Good agreement was seen between the codes,\nwith the largest differences at the model nose and near the\nnozzle. The CFD underpredicted the CP for the majority\nof the model face and side, with overpredictions at the nose\nby FUN3D for run 130 and by OVERFLOW for run 132.\nOVERFLOW closely matched the test averageCP at the nose\nfor run 130, and near the nozzle for runs 130 and 132. DPLR,\nwhich reached a steady state solution, closely matched the\naverage CP on the model side for run 130.\nAs ? increased \(see Figure 9 a noticeable difference\nin the windward triple point of the windward plume which\nincreased in oscillation size. This same behavior existed for\nall tested ? angles up to 12?. Here lies a weakness in the\nOVERFLOW results. For ? angles up to 8?, the windward\nplume maintained its shape, but for ? = 12?, the windward\nplume was compressed, and the resulting flow structure was\nmore unsteady than what was seen in the test. The difference\nin flow behavior did not greatly influence the average surface\npressure comparison, all cases still compared well to the test\ndata.\nThe effects of roll test, the three barrel plumes still maintained\ntheir shapes regardless of roll, but in the OVERFLOW results,\nonly ? = 210? showed that behavior where the rest showed\nthe compressed windward plume. For the cases with ? =\n180? and 30?, the compressed plume was more directly\nin line with the oncoming tunnel flow, or more relatively\nwindward than for the ? = 210? case. For the ? = 210?\ncase, the two windward plumes were equally windward, and\nneither were as directly in-lined with the flow as the other ?\ncases.\nThe high pressure at the nose of the model for the 3-nozzle\nconfigurations should not be taken to be resultant of on-\ncoming freestream flow penetrating the space between the\nplumes. Instead, the high pressure region is caused by a\nrecirculation zone created by entrapment of jet exhaust and\nentrainment from surrounding flow. Differences in surface\nCP between the codes can be attributed to differences in\nmodeling the recirculation caused by that entrainment and\nentrapment.\n7\nFigure 8. Effects of CT ; test shadowgraph compared to CFD constructed Schlieren/shadowgraph and average surface\npressure comparison for the 3-nozzle configuration at Mach 1.8. The CFD solver visualizations for runs 126, 130, and 132\nare OVERFLOW, DPLR, and FUN3D, respectively.\n8\nFigure 9.

The CFD solver visualization for ? = 0? is FUN3D and\nfor the other ? angles is OVERFLOW.\nFigure 10. Effects of ?; test shadowgraph compared to CFD constructed Schlieren and average surface pressure comparison\nfor the 3-nozzle configuration at Mach 2.4, CT 6.\n9\nRun 139 was used for a code-to-code comparison and is vi-\nsualized in Figure 11. In the test, the flow was more unsteady\nthan shown in the CFD solvers. FUN3D was closest to the\nunsteady behavior, but eventually reached a steady state. This\ndemonstrated that the boundaries between different modes of\nbehavior for SRP, in this case the boundary between unsteady\nand much steadier flow as CT increases, was not captured\nwell by the CFD codes For the average CP , FUN3D\noverpredicted at the nose and bounded the test data on the\nmodel side, DPLR closely matched on the face and side with\nan underprediction near the nozzle, and OVERFLOW closely\nmatched on the face but predicted nearly symmetric CP on\nthe side.\nConfidence in the ability of CFD to simulate 3-nozzle SRP\nconfigurations is stronger for higher CT s than for lower\nCT s. The boundary between the unsteady lower CT s and\nthe much steadier higher CT s is not well predicted by CFD,\nbut once the steadier mode is obtained better agreement\nbetween the CFD solvers and the test data is achieved. The\nLRC UPWT CFD validation exercise showed that all solvers\nclosely matched the wind tunnel test qualitatively in behavior,\nbut differences in average surface CP did exist. A possible\nerror source for the CFD may be the grid system, which was\noptimized for 1-nozzle SRP flow, but may not be optimized\nFigure 11. Code-to-code and code-to-test comparison of\nRun 139: 3-nozzle, Mach 2.4, CT 4.\nfor multi-nozzle flows with interacting shear layers.\n4-Nozzle Configuration\nSection 5 discussed that differences in the shock standoff\ndistance as well as the level of unsteadiness changed based\non thrust coefficient for zero angle of attack 4-nozzle cases.\nAt lower CT s the flow was steadier with a short bow shock\nstandoff distance, and at higher CT s the flow became chaotic\nwith large and oscillating shock standoff distances. This trend\nwas noted in the ARC UPWT test results, which ranged from\na CT of 2 for run 166 to a CT of 10 for run 185 of the\nCFD matrix. The CFD matched the behavior of 


the zero ?\ncases well, but not much value was placed in the average\nsurface pressure comparisons. Since the flow was chaotic and\nthe data acquisition rates varied so greatly between the CFD\nand WTT data, the averages obtained by the CFD and WTT\ndiffered greatly. The WTT data acquisition rates were also\nnot sufficient to gather enough samples for this chaotic flow.\nAs ? angle increased, the level of unsteadiness decreased in\nthe test, as seen with run 179 in Figure 12. This behavior\nwas not matched by OVERFLOW, which continued to predict\na highly chaotic flowfield at ? angles of 4? and 8?. This\nmay be a limitation in the grid system which was optimized\nfor a 1-nozzle configuration and then applied to multi-nozzle\nconfigurations.\n10\nFigure 12. Effects of ?; test shadowgraph compared to\nCFD constructed Schlieren/shadowgraph and average surface\npressure comparison for the 4-nozzle configuration, run 179:\nMach 2.4, CT 4. The CFD solver visualization for ? = 0? is\nFUN3D, and for the other ? angles is OVERFLOW.\nCode-to-code comparisons can be seen in Figure 13 for run\n166 \(Mach 1.8, CT 4 standoff distance of lower thrust coefficients.\nThis behavior was matched by FUN3D and OVERFLOW,\nbut a large standoff distance was predicted by DPLR. The\naverage surface CP by DPLR overpredicted FUN3D and\nOVERFLOW, both of which were closer to the test data.\nThe FUN3D CP data showed a more dynamic behavior than\nOVERFLOW and DPLR, a result of insufficient averaging.\nThe confidence in the ability of the CFD solvers to simulate\n4-nozzle flow is not as strong as it is for the 1-nozzle configu-\nration. The change in the short-penetration standoff distance\nto the wildly chaotic behavior was predicted to be at different\npoints between the CFD solvers. Due to the highly unsteady\nbehavior of the 4-nozzle configuration at CT s greater than\nfour, it was difficult to obtain reasonable average surface\npressure comparisons between the CFD and the WTT. Also,\nsteadier modes at angle of attack were seen for the 4-nozzle\nconfiguration which were not simulated with the CFD.\nThrust Dominance\nFor the SRP cases discussed, the total axial force \(CA,total =\nCT + CA,aero was dominated by the thrust coefficient and\nthe contribution of the aerodynamic axial force was very\nFigure 13. Code-to-code and code-to-test comparison of\nRun 166: 4-nozzle, Mach 1.8, CT 4.\nsmall. This can be seen in the bar chart in Figure 14 where\nthe gray section of the bars represent CT and the blue sec-\ntions represent CA,aero. This raises the question to whether\naerodynamic effects are negligible for these types of SRP\nflows More research needs to be conducted to answer this\nquestion. Entry trajectories and angles as well as spacecraft\nscale need to be taken into consideration. A high frequency\noscillation at the WTT scale will be a much lower frequency\nat the flight scale, and may have more contribution to vehicle\nstability. Normal force and the vehicle moments also need to\nbe taken into consideration, especially for non-zero vehicle\nentry angles.\nFigure 14. Comparison of the contributions of thrust and\naerodynamics to the total axial force for the ARC UPWT\nCFD cases run by OVERFLOW.\n11\nComputational Cost\nTable 2 shows a breakdown of the computational cost for each\nof the codes for a typical SRP run. This is not a perfect\ncomparison since the numbers represented are either just\nfrom a single run or averages of multiple runs. All cases were\ncomputed on the Pleiades NASA Advanced Supercomputing\ncluster, an SGI Ice cluster, on either Nehalem or Westmere\nnodes. Since each code used different amounts of time,\nnumber of iterations, number of sub-iterations, and number\nof grid points, a common metric of CPU seconds per iteration\nper grid point between the codes is reported for comparison.\nPart of the requirement for these validation runs was to test\nthe ability of the solvers to predict the SRP flowfields For\nthis reason, time-accurate runs were necessary because it\nis impossible to know beforehand if the unsteady effects\nplayed a large role in the aerodynamic effects. Costs for\nvalidation cases were large; however, for production runs of\nparametric studies or database generation, the computational\ncosts should be able to drop significantly as either steady state\nruns or higher efficient numerical and time step processes are\nadopted.\nTable 2. Computational Cost Per Case\nSolver CPU\nHours\nIterations Grid\nPoints\nCPU\ns/iter/gp\nFUN3D 28,000 39,500 4.2e7 6.1e-05\nDPLR 44,500 106,000 5.3e7 2.9e-05\nOVERFLOW 35,039 73,500 8.5e7 2.0e-05\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nA second wind tunnel test for validation of CFD in SRP\nconditions was conducted in the ARC UPWT 9?×7? tunnel.\nThe ARC UPWT test had a larger test section than the\nprevious test, which took place in the LRC UPWT 4?× 4?\ntunnel. With the larger test section, higher thrust coefficients\nwere obtained that closer match flight requirements.\nFor the 1-nozzle configuration, not much difference was\nobserved between the higher thrust coefficients of 4 obtained\nin the ARC UPWT and the lower thrust coefficients of 2\nobtained in the LRC UPWT. The short-penetration shock\ninteraction structure was observed, and oscillations at the\ntriple point increased for the windward triple point as angle\nof attack was increased. The CFD solvers compared well\nto the 1-nozzle cases in the CFD matrix, only varying in\npredicting periodic oscillations of the triple point when ran-\ndom oscillations were observed in the test. Average surface\npressure comparisons were promising, building confidence in\nthe ability of CFD to predict 1-nozzle configuration SRP.\nFor the 3-nozzle configuration, the unsteady behavior noted\nat lower thrust coefficients of 2 did not exist for higher thrust\ncoefficients where 


the flow structure becomes more steady,\nespecially in the bow shock. This behavior was predicted\nwell with the CFD, and average surface pressures agreed well\nwith the WTT. The area of greatest deviation between the\ncodes was along the model shoulder and at the model nose.\nThe differences at the nose are attributed to differences in\nentrainment, entrapment, and recirculation being simulated\nbetween the codes at the model nose, as well as any shear\nlayer interaction that may be occurring between the plumes.\nAt ? and ?T 12?, OVERFLOW did not predict the same be-\nhavior as the WTT, predicting a more compressed windward\nbarrel plume for most cases This discrepancy in qualitative\ncomparison did not seem to greatly influence the average\nsurface pressure comparison.\nFor the 4-nozzle configuration, a steadier mode with a short\nshock standoff distance existed for lower CT s. As CT was\nincreased, the flow becomes highly unsteady with the bow\nshock standoff distance aperiodically oscillating between\nsmall and large standoff distances. The unsteady flowfield\nwas predicted well with the CFD codes, but the average sur-\nface pressures were not comparable to WTT data, presumably\ndue to large differences in data acquisition rates between the\nCFD and WTT and the large difference in time-averaging\nwindows. At ? 4? and 8?, a steadier mode was noted\nwhich was not predicted by OVERFLOW, which continued\nto predict a largely chaotic flowfield.\nGiven the comparisons in this validation study confidence\nwas built in the ability of CFD to simulate 1-nozzle con-\nfigurations at all ? angles tested, and high thrust 3-nozzle\nconfigurations at ? ? 8?. The ability to simulate the\nbehavior seen in the high thrust 4-nozzle cases was also\ndemonstrated, but average surface pressure comparisons were\npoor. The ability of the CFD codes to predict the exact\nboundary between steady and unsteady modes for 1-, 3-, and\n4-nozzle configurations was not demonstrated, and in fact\noffered contradictory results in both the LRC UPWT and\nARC UPWT tests for the 4-nozzle ?/? zero configuration.\nThe average surface pressure comparisons were the best for\nthe 1-nozzle configuration and for the steadier runs of the\n3- and 4-nozzle configurations. This correlates to steadier\nflowfields where the large difference in data acquisition rates\nbetween the CFD WTT did not greatly influence the averages\nobtained. Another possible error source may be the grid\nsystems used for each code which were optimized for 1-\nnozzle SRP flow, not for multi-nozzle flows with shear layer\ninteractions.\nThrust dominance and computational costs were also men-\ntioned. Computational costs were high for validation but\ncould be much less for production.\nFuture work for CFD validation would include live rocket\ntests including startup transients, more flight-relevant calcu-\nlations including Mars atmospheric and rocket nozzle gases,\nand an application to flight-scaled spacecraft to better under-\nstand the influence of aerodynamics on stability and control.\nFuture wind tunnel tests could include pressure measurement\ninstrumentation along the model shoulder to help validate\nCFD in that area. More CFD research may be needed to\nproperly define the boundaries between different behavioral\nmodes, as well as an optimization of a grid system for multi-\nnozzle SRP flowfields.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPieter G.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
