Dynamic Data Mining for Information Exploitation Sherry Marcus 21\223 Century Technologies Inc 8302 Lincoln Lane Suite 103, McLean VA 22102 Abstract There is now an ever increasing threat to the nation\222s cyberspace infrastructure Cyberterrorists can and have broken into power systems banking systems and defense systems with relative ease In this paper we show how data mining technologies can be exploited in the identification of threats on the Internet Currently large data repositories are currently maintained 
by military organizations which contain Internet addresses of those who access legitimately or illegitimately\military systems. This information together with additional information from other data sources can be mined so as to identify suspicious 222profiles\222 A profile consists of sets of rules that define suspicious behavior Knowledge bases consisting of these profiles can be developed in conjunction with data mining technologies such as case based reasoning association clustering temporal and similarity reasoning for the purpose of targeting 
 in advance potential threats on the Internet In this paper we report on a system called ProfileMiner\(TM\222 that we have developed Using ProfileMiner users can describe profiles of interest to them The ProfileMiner system automatically creates similar profiles and alerts the user when an individual or activity precisely matches the profile or when he matches a 223similar\224 profile ProfileMiner may also identify other investigators looking at similar profiles so that 
investigators are aware of other ongoing parallel investigations I INTRODUCTION Every day law enforcement agencies conduct thousands of investigations pertaining to drug trafficking weapons smuggling NBC-related transactions to illegal transportation of endangered species In most cases the perpetrators are individuals or criminal organizations while in other cases they involve governments or officials serving governments of rogue nations The Internet provides a medium for communication between the entities of such organizations  yet unlike the case of phone systems where 
monitoring technology is well developed not much is known about how to legally monitor suspicious Internet transactions For example an investigative official monitoring the newsgroup news.listserv.disarm may wish to see who all are posting messages to this newsgroup He may also wish to correlate this information with names of suspected terrorists belonging to rogue nations and/or to correlate this information with individuals who are also posting messages to the newsgroup nuclear.news He may wish to find out all known e 
mail addresses for a suspect who satisfies the above conditions Expressing such correlation requests is potentially cumbersome and complex in classical languages like SQL In time critical situations the investigator should not have to waste his valuable time, fighting with cumbersome SQL query systems Instead he should be able to express conditions that he is interested in monitoring using a simple graphical user interface The language in which these conditions are specified should be rich enough to access heterogeneous data 
sources  13 as well as rich enough to analyze temporal activity patterns Furthermore, once he has specified one or more such conditions of interest to him the system should automatically alert him when new individuals or organizations fit the profiles that he has specified In addition the system should be smart enough to infer new profiles that may be of interest to the user We have developed a system called ProfileMiner that is capable of 
managing multiple profiles registered by authorized users and providing the array of services described above The organization of this paper is as follows Section 2 contains a birdseye view of the architecture of the ProfileMiner system Section 3 provides a description of the data mining and link analysis components of the ProfileMiner system while Section 4 describes a sample scenario of the working of the system 0-7803-9914-5/98/$10.00 0 1998 IEEE 79 


11 PRQFILE MINER A A System Architecture We describe in this section the current architecture of the ProfileMiner system. This architecture has been design to maximize the ability to 223plug and play\224 with most Commercial Off The Shelf Products COTS Our architecture contains the following basic components Web-Compliant Interface The user such as an intelligence or law enforcement investigator\interacts with through any standard Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator This single interface may be used to specify the different profiles that the user is interested in monitoring as well as directly execute queries on data sources  It can also correlate the answers of different queries as well as browse the results of automated monitoring and/or the results of specific queries Analytic Tools The conditions that the user specifies may be executed by a variety of analytic tools These tools include data mining text retrieval and extraction and relational database technologies Data Mining Tools Data Mining technologies provide the user the ability.to identify new links and relationships from data that were previously unknown We rely heavily on case based reasoning tools in the context of a relational database that provide the means to find records similar to a specified record or records In addition we exploit knowledge discovery tools that are specially designed to identify significant relationships that exist among variables These tools are useful when there are many possible relationships For example if theanalyst has to track 200 variables about a particular individual or 200 individuals about a particular variable our knowledge discovery capability will provide the ability to point out what are the significant relationships Thus when a user specifies a set of profile conditions that he wants to monitor the system will intelligently expand this set of profile conditions to new related conditions that the user may not have explicitly specified For example the system might notice that an NBC-suspect say named Wavid Jones posts a message to the newsgroup news.listserv.disarm every Monday and a response is posted within 24 hours to the same newsgroup by Jonathan Smith The data mining system can discover such patterns on USENET postings or any type of structured textual data format Link Analysis Tools Link analysis is the science of linking a suspect with other individuals or orgadiditions In the above example the Link Analysis tdol might conclude that the link between David Jones and Jonathan Smith is significant because Jonathan Smith is employed by an international shipping company  this may lead to a possibility of illegal shipment of NBC-related items Visualization Tools Visualization Tools provide the user with a visual representation of the exploited data When specifying his profile information the user of ProfileMiner can also specify how he wants to visualize the results computed by ProfileMiner e.g through an Excel bar-chart or just as a Web document containing hyperlinks to the postings indexed by the name of the poster and date of the posting involved Information Exploitation Database IED The analytic tools described in the section above analyze views of raw data contained in an Oracle Information Exploitation Database created by ProfileMiner For example the IED may contain pointers to the various postings made by Jonathan Smith the postings are raw data sources In other words the IED represents a view of the raw data sources and thus only contains information that is timely and pertinent to the profiles being managed by ProfileMiner Thus, even though postings to news 1istserv.disarm may include postings by James Rubin the State Department spokesman these would not find their way into the IED because these are not deemed relevant to the profiles managed by ProfileMiner Information Extraction Tools The IED is derived from a variety of 223raw\224 data sources such as USENET postings, GOTS databases and video/audio sources these are not currently integrated in the ProfileMiner system but techniques for such integration tasks were developed by us in collaboration with the University of Maryland and the US Army 1,2 We have developed algorithms to extract the key 223content\224 of a text documents such as USENET pastings and then update/populate the IED with this content 80 


Raw Data Sources All the tools described above access a variety of data sources such as USENET data and COTS databases which may be stored in a plethora of heterogeneous data formats and also may be resident at distributed network sites MAVIS has integrated most commercial relational and object oriented database systems ProfileMiner can currently access a variety of such sources through our proprietary MAVIS system 11 DATA MINING AND LINK ANALYSIS MODULES A Profile Descriptions Analysts will be able to determine user newsgroup date subject country of origin country of destination and content of USENET posting merely by typing in a specific field of interest into our graphical user interface These fields such as user newsgroup and date were used because these are the fields found in USENET postings Any analyst defined fields can be implemented as required For example questions of the sort Find all postings to the Internet made by anyone in Israel Could easily be handled by typing into the appropriate newgroup and country of destination fields We are able to identify any specific country through the e mail address used to post to the newsgroup This type of query used in conjunction with other profiling mechanisms can be used in the identification of focused targets See figure 1 for query description and figure 2 for an example output page A r  rat Figure One Interface for IW Exploitation Figure 2 Sample IW Output The query 223Find all e-mail accounts used by a specific person to all UseNet groups.\224 could easily be handled by typing into the appropriate newsgroup posting and country of destination fields The CUI that is used to express profiles generates PL/SQL code that may be executed on the IED Oracle database yet the user does not even have to be aware that SQL is being used by ProfileMiner B Data Mining and Link Analysis Techniques ProfileMiner\221s mining and link analysis tools are in reality a suite of data mining tools and an information architecture acting in concert to generate and identify unknown electronic relationships and activities of a target or set of targets We refer to ProfileMiner suite of data mining tools as 223Digital Fingerprint\224 because we wish to draw an analogy between a 223classic fingerprint\224 and an 223Digital Fingerprint\224 A digital fingerprint is broadly defined as those sets of actions that can identify a target based on electronic information generated by the target and may be detectable only through data mining tools Analogously a 223classic fingerprint\224 can identify a target based on physical information fingerprints generated by the target and is detectable only by the appropriate law enforcement methods Using the current version of ProfileMiner one receives a concise report and visualization of computer FTPRelnet logs e-mail Web Server access and publicly available Usenet postings generated from the suite of tools briefly described in the next paragraphs Digital Temporal Patterns is a data mining tool contained within the current version of ProfileMiner designed to track and reference electronic temporal 81 


activities The result of such a temporal data mining activity identifies and graphically depicts when specified targets perform certain operations on the Internet and correlates these activities with other potentially illegal or damaging events For instance every time a particular target accesses the site www.ahcde.com it may turn out that within one day the target receives an electronic funds transfer from the Cayman Islands If such a temporal pattern is detected over a period of time then one may be tempted to infer that when the target logs into www.abcde.com then the site www.abctlc.coin recognizes this as a transaction requesting an electronics funds transfer. There are a variety of operational scenarios where such temporal information is crucial. Recognizing such patterns is a challenging task Digital Miner is a tool within ProfileMiner that uses a variety of database and data mining technologies such as case based reasoning knowledge discovery rule bases and heterogeneous data access to exploit the structure of a relational database in order to determine new and unknown relationships Digital Miner can identify and link seemingly unrelated facts. For example the electronic record recording the fact that John Smith posts to newsgroups about computer security is innocuous Another electronic record describing Jane Johnson\222s attempts to illegally penetrate a government computer system is apparently unrelated However the link that Jane Johnson used techniques found in John Smiths\222 ties these two records together This is Digital Miners function In this case Digital Miner would have assisted law enforcement authorities in locating an additional suspect in this case John Smith or a network of suspects operatives so that arrest of the latter does not compromise the former It is therefore very important to analyze not only direct communication links between networked individuals but also the indirect links that arise when target A communicates with target B who then communicates with target C and so on Thus one is able to identify a 223virtual network\224 of operatives each performing unique operations over the Internet IV CONCLUSIONS While many law enforcement agencies have extensively studied such link analysis in the context of phone systems no comparable link analysis methods exist on the market today for Internet link analysis Internet link analysis is considerably different from phone link analysis because of the infinite opportunities to spoof, assume false identities and break through firewalls The need for such tools in investigative capacities will increase as commercial use of the Internet increases in the consumer and corporate arenas The Virtual Network component of ProfileMiner provides a first advance in this emerging area IV REFERENCES I A Brink S Marcus and V.S Subrahmanian Heterogeneous Multimedia Reasoning IEEE Computer September 1995 S Marcus and V.S Subrahmanian Foundations of Multimedia Information Systems Journal of the ACM November 1996 3 Towards a Theory of Multimedia Database Systems Multimedia Database Systems Research Issues and Directions Edited by V.S Subrahmanian and S Jajodia Springer-Verlag 1995 with V.S Subrahmanian 2 Virtual Network is another tool within the current version of ProfileMiner which identifies and graphically depicts indirect digital communications between two targets. For example, Targets A and B may communicate via e-mail to two distinct cutouts C and D Cutouts C and D in turn communicate to cutouts E and F who communicate with each other on Internet Chat Virtual Network can identify varieties of Internet communications such as Internet postings FTPRelnet logs etc and use such information to generate networks One fundamental aspect of communications chain of command in intelligence, paramilitary, narcotics and terrorist networks is that the principals usually maintain a considerable distance from the \223low-level\224 82

Ten classification functions were used to produce data distributions of varying complesitics in tllis paper We use first 5 functions to produce 5 data sets named predl -predj among which predj corresponding function 5 is one of the hardest to characterize mid results in the highest classification errors oredl I 14 4.1 Accuracy and Number of Rules We use a small data set 200 cases for every function to present the accuracy and number of rules of three algorithms. Since C5.0 is the new version of C4.5 and much more accurate and faster than C4.5 in the experiment we compared our algorithms with C5.0 Table 1 shows the classification accuracy of different algorithm while table 2 shows the number of rules produced by every algorithm Table1 Accuracy of difrerent algorithms 16 16 pred2 pred3 15 21 15 20 30 30 pred4 pred5 In the experiment for a categorical attribute all i,ts possible values are mapped to a set of consecutive positive integers For a continuous attribute its value range is discretized into intervals and each interval is also mapped to a set of consecutive positive integers It can be seen from table 1 that both UARC and GARC are more accurate than C5.0 for every data set Table 2 shows that the number of rules produced by UARC or GARC is more than that produced by C5.0 while those rules that are not included in the result of C5.0 are useful to improve classification accuracy and are just what 25.0 can not obtain For example, for dataset pred4 one of rules found by both UARC and GARC is IF commission~40000 and commission<50000 THEN group= 1 This rule is useful and accurate according to function 4 but C5.0 could not found it Table 2 also indicates that UARC generates more rules than GARC for some datasets The reason is that the set of candidate itemsets becomes small due to the deletion of some cases, wvl~ch also lead to the lower accuracy of GARC than UARC 23 30 26 29 76 38 4.2 Speed And Scalability hi this part we use different size of data set of function 3 to examine tlie speed and scalability of our two algorithms along the number of training cases Figure 3 illustrates the execution time used by UARC and GARC as tlie iiumber of training cases increased from 200 to 100000 As we can see from figure 3 compared to UARC algorithm GARC is faster and the difference behveen UARC and GARC becomes larger as the number of cases increases The result also indicates that both two algorithms achieve near-linear execution time on disk resident dah 180 I 1 LLl 3 20  0 0 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 91 98 Number of examples\(in thousand Figiue 3 Speed and scalability IU 915 


5 CONCLUSION Both classification rule mining and association rule mining are important problems in the field of data mining Many kinds of classification algorithms have been proposed in the past and in recent years But each of thein has its drawbacks In this paper two algorithms are designed to use the basic concept of association rules to find classification rules directly and efficiently From the empirical evaluation we can see that both two algoritluns achieve better classification accuracy and produce complete, useful sets of rules. It is also shown that these two algorilluns both have a good scalability and GARC has a betttT execution speed than UARC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was partly supported by National Science Foundation of China grant No 69674037 and grant No 79825 102 and National Defense Foundation of China REFERENCES I G Piatetsky-Shapiro U Fayyad P Smyth Froni data nriniiig to kirowlcdge discovery Air oiwvieii Advairccs iir Kiiowledge Discovety aiid Data Miiziiig AAAMT press 1996,pp 1-35 2 J R Quinlan C3.5 Progranis for Machine Leamiiig Morgan Kaufmaiui 1993 3 Manish Mehta, Rakesh Agrawal and Jomia Rissanen SLIQ A Fast Scalable Classijer for Data Mining Extending database technology 1996 pp. 18-32 4 J Catlett hlegaindrictioii: Macliine 'Learxiiig on kiy Laige Databases PID thesis, University of Sydney, 1991 5 K llsaDti S Rolilia I Sirrgli CLOIJDS 4 dccisiori Tree classifier for Large Ilata sets hi Proc Of the Fourth hit Conference on IGionlcdge Discovery R Data Mining New York New York August 27-3 I 1998 pp 2-8 6 Biiig Liu Wyiuie HSU and Yiming Ma hitegglit Classij7catioir mid Associatiori Ride hfiniiig In Proc Of the Fo~irth Int Conference on Knowledge Discovery R Data Milling New York New York August 27-3 1 1998, page 80 86 7 R Agrawal T Imielinski aiid A Swami hfiiriiig association ides behveeii sets of itctns iii large databases In: Proceeding of 1993 ACM-SIGMOD hit Conf On Management of Data Washington D.C 1993, pp 207-216 8 R Agrawal R Snkant Fast algorithm for mining association rules In Proc Of the 20th VLDB Conference Santiago, Chilc 1994 pp 487-499 9 J S Park M S Chen and P.S Yu An Effective Hash-based Algorithnr for bfinitig Association rules In Proceedings of ACM-SIGMOD Int Conf On Management of Data Baltimore MD 1995, pp 175-186 10.H Toivonen Sanrplirig Large Databases for Associatioir Rirles hi 22th International Conference on VLDB Bombay India.

Figure 7 Correlations between query con straints and new indexed constraint the index attribute may have different ranges We iden tify all possible constraint introduction solutions as follows Algorithm For each constraint on the index attribute CO.Roj Step 1 find the least expensive association from a query constraint to i.e find the incoming link C~.R  CO.Roj with the fewest exceptions For exam ple if the cardinalities of El     E5 are nl   n5 and n4 5 nz _ n3 then the least expensive association for CO.R is c6.b  CO.R~,\(E  E4 Step 2 filter out all the exceptions that do not satisfy at least one of the query constraints C1.Rl    C12 We do not need to test the exceptions for the antecedent of the corresponding rule since they satisfy it by definition The constraint introduction solutions identified in our example are the following  Introduced Constraints Exceptions ele t El Cz.n,\(e    C12.nl2\(e el  E4 C1.h e    C5.nS e C~.R e     C12.nll e ele  E5 C1.nl e     C5.nS e C~.R e    C12.n12 e CO.Rol CO.RO2 CO.RO3 5 Optimizing OQL queries In the previous sections a series of algorithms were given to find a collection of constraint elimination or con straint introduction solutions In this section we show how the original query is transformed to its optimized form using the optimal solution. Consider the OQL query select x fromExtentX as x where C~.R and   and Cn 5.1 Heuristic H1 Let  Cil   Ci,},Ei  be the maintained con straints and the exceptions of a solution i Only the main tained constraints of the optimization solution should be tested on the objects of the whole extent however all the constraints should be tested on the exception cases and the objects that satisfy the maintained constraints but not the ones omitted should be removed from the result Hence the original query should be converted to the following one select x from Extent2 as x where Cil and   and Ci except Ei If we assume that tests on the query constraints take roughly the same time, the optimal solution is the one with fewest exceptions Ei 5.2 Heuristic H2 Let  Co.Roi Ei  be the index constraint and the corre sponding exceptions of a constraint introduction solution Instead of testing the query constraints C1.~l    C,.R on the entire extent Extent X we apply them only on the re sults of the subquery select x from Extent2 as x 40 where CO.R Since Co.Roi is a constraint on a cluster index attribute, the select operation is expected to be quite fast The original query is transformed to its more efficient form select x from 90 as x where Cl and    and C union Ei The exceptions Ei are merged to the result because they satisfy the query constraints but not the new index con straint Co.Roi Since the union operation is relatively cheap the optimal solution is the one that introduces the index con straint with the highest selectivity 6 Discussion We now look at two different scenarios and estimate the extent to which heuristics H1 and H2 speed up query exe cution The Jirst scenario concerns frequently executed queries Assume that the association rules which are used by algo rithm 3 are not modified We may optimize a query once at compilation time then execute its optimized form It is worth optimizing provided that the execution time of the optimized query is less than the execution time of the orig inal query For heuristic H1 this happens only if the time 132 


saved by omitting some constraints is greater than the time needed to remove the exceptions from the result except operation The more the eliminated constraints and the fewer the exceptions the better the optimization As one of the referees pointed out, the time saved by the elimina tion of constraints is CPU-related Since query execution is dominated by data access time this optimization is not expected to alter performance significantly It would help only in contexts rich in associations with few exceptions in which users express many constraints in their queries Heuristic H2 is expected to bring more significant ben efits Firstly, this optimization involves a union operation which is much cheaper than the except operation used in H1 Secondly instead of retrieving all the objects of an extent from the database we need only look at the subset retrieved through an indexed constraint Hence we save a considerable amount of data access time, spending a negli gible amount of CPU time in evaluating the additional con straint The second scenario concerns queries which are exe cuted only once In this case the time required for opti mization is significant. This time depends on the algorithm that finds associations between relaxed constraints and tight constraints \(see section 3 since this is the most expensive step in the optimization process This algorithm finds paths in a directed graph, and combines the exceptions associated with each edge of the path to derive the total exceptions for the path. Therefore its complexity is a function of i the av erage number of exceptions in the existing association rules and ii the number of different constraints found in the an tecedents and the consequents of the rules We have already implemented the algorithms for apply ing H1 the next step is to implement the corresponding al gorithms for H2 This should not be difficult since the main algorithm  finding associations between rule constraints  is common to the two heuristics We intend to set up an experimental model in order to evaluate H1 and H2 in the scenarios discussed above 7 Conclusion The use of association rules for query optimization is rel evant to both relational and object-oriented database sys tems There has been a lot of research on generating asso ciation rules and maintaining them in the presence of up dates Research has also focused on finding heuristics that take advantage of rules in order to optimize a query Most of this work 2 31 has considered integrity rules rather than association rules with exceptions Semantic optimiza tion heuristics were also applied without considering indi rect associations In this paper we implement algorithms that apply two optimization heuristics presented by Siegel et al taking account of both exceptions and indirect asso ciations We show how to use these heuristics to optimize an OQL query The complexity of the optimization process is closely related to the complexity of the constraint graph which represents the set of association rules in the data It also depends on the number of exceptions associated with each rule We have designed an experimental framework to evaluate the two optimization techniques both in the con text of queries repeated frequently over a period of time, and in the context of ad-hoc queries executed once only The re sults of this experimental work will be presented in a later paper 8 Acknowledgements We are grateful to the anonymous referees who read the paper carefully and critically and made many helpful suggestions Agathoniki Trigoni is supported by a scholar ship from the Greek Scholarships Foundation and is deeply obliged to the National Bank of Greece References I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining asso ciation rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intl Conference on Management oj data pages 207-2 16 1993 2 U Chakravarthy J Grant and J Minker Logic-based ap proach to semantic query optimization ACM Transactions on Database Systems 15\(2 162-207 1990 3 J Grant, J.Gryz J Minker and L Raschid.
