E-Voting System Security Optimization      Barbara Ondrisek Vienna University of Technology barbara.ondrisek@gmx.net  Abstract Security of e-voting systems does not only depend on the voting protocol 1 or the software used but concerns the whole system with all its comp onents. To guarantee security a holistic approach, which considers all parts of such a complex system, has to be chosen. The security of an election system cannot be ensured unless every single element and its securityrelated characteristics, interfaces to other elements 
and their impact on the w hole system are examined This paper presents the E-Voting System Security Optimization method, which is based on such an approach and was developed to evaluate the security of e-voting systems. This method points out security flaws, shows security optimization potential, and can be used to compare different election systems. The methodology differs from other approaches insofar as it uses a holistic approach, visualizes the security situation of an e-voting system in a clear way, and shows its potential for improvement   1. Introduction  E-voting has been a very controversial topic ever 
since the presidential elections in the U.S. in 2000 Many security flaws were found [9 th e s t an dards for the implementation of e-voting systems were shown to be too weak d m a ny s cie n ti f i c x perts expressed their negative opinions on e-voting [18, 19  e rth e les s  e f f o rts are still m a de to i n trodu ce e voting in countries that use traditional paper ballots E-voting is an election method in which the votes are cast or collected electronically  computer system whose main element is an software component that maps the voting procedure 
electronically is called an e-voting system. A direct recording electronic DRE\machine is a special case of such a system as it implements all steps in the voting   1  A voting protocol \(also called voting scheme or voting algorithm is defined as the general architecture of the software system \(e.g. separation of issuance- and urn server\n the one hand and as the steps to complete a vote \(e.g. first step 
authentication\ on the other hand process, from registration and ballot casting to counting There are two different forms of voting: distance and presence voting 2, pp In presence voting, a voter can cast his or her vote in a polling station under the supervision of the election's administration Examples for presence voting are conventional elections in polling stations or voting with e-voting machines. In distance voting, the voter acts without the 
supervision of the electoral commission and casts his or her vote from a place other than a polling booth such as casting absentee ballots via mail or internet voting  1.1. Fundamental Election Rules, Suffrage, and Law   For e-voting systems the following legal principles are fundamen universal suffrage every person \(restricted by age may vote equality of votes every vote counts the same free suffrage voter s autonomy of decision must be 
granted secrecy of votes anonymity must be granted direct voting \(vs indirect voting voting without intermediaries or electors must be granted personal right to vote personal voting without representatives must be granted One rule outside of the canon of conventional election rules is essential for traditional voting procedures as well as for e-voting systems publicity and transparency election observation and audit processes must be implemented 
If these rules are not followed strictly, the integrity of the election process is at risk and this can constitute a single point of failure for the democratic process. The e-voting system can be classified as unusable as soon as one of these election rules is disregarded  2. E-Voting Systems  An e-voting system is a system consisting of mechanical, electromechanical, and electrical parts.

contains software to control the devices, to define the ballots, to cast and count the votes, and to calculate and display the results The main tasks of e-voting systems registration registration of the voters in a list or registry legitimation identification, authentication, and authorization of users casting of votes the electronic ballot is displayed and may be cast anonymously by a citizen collecting of votes votes cast are collected by an urn server processing of votes votes are processed and an election result is calculated and presented  2.1. Elements of an E-Voting System   Similar to the separation into physical, syntactic and semantic attac r in to s y ste m  h a rd w a re system software, and the human operator of the system 17 p. 73  ev o ting s y s t e m can be div i ded in to th ree main categories: hardware, software, and human factors Therefore, the security-relevant elements are the following hardware mechanical, electromechanical, and electrical parts software operating system, drivers, compilers programs, databases, rules used in the program procedures and sequences \(order of voting events voting protocol, encryption techniques human factors this category comprises usability rules, strategies \(e.g. information flow, security management\nd other diverse aspects such as transparency, acceptance, and trust All parts of the system have to be considered as equally important in terms of security risks  3. Security of E-Voting Systems  Security is a fundamental criterion for the selection and use of electronically supported election systems. To assure security in e-voting systems, an integral approach that covers all parts of this complex system should be chosen. This method is also called holistic security  th is approach, all ele m e n t s o f a s y ste m  and all aspects of security, such as system stability secrecy, integrity, availability, reliability, safety, and maintainability, also ha ve to be considered   3.1. Related Work  The Common Criteria standard is widely used for certification of the security of IT systems, but no protection profile for e-voting systems has been published so far. The Common Criteria is restricted to security and does not handle safety and other aspects of reliability. Guidelines such as the standards of the Council of Eu th e U S F e deral Elect i on Commission t eps i n th e righ t direction  b u t  these regulations are not obligatory Studies published so far compared a selection of evoting schemes on the grounds of different aspects of security [6 15  T h es e pa pers  dealt w i t h th e t h eoretical  fundamentals of the electronic election process, but did not focus on the practical application in complex evoting systems The Test Process Improvement TPI®\ model  a model for the improvement of the software test process, and the Capability Maturity Model CMM  s e m e t h odol og i e s  f or t h e as s e ssm e nt of  sy s t e m s that are similar to the EVSSO method, but they too have very different focuses  3.2. A Method for Evaluation and Optimization of the Security of E-Voting Systems  The E-Voting System Security Optimization method was developed, taking into account detailed analyses of many e-voting systems and their problems and security flaws. This method is a tool for the optimization of the security of e-voting systems. It may be used to visually determine the level of maturity of security in an objective and detailed manner. Through its checkliststyled structure, the model enables the formulation of specific and practically realizable suggestions to optimize the safeguards of the tested e-voting systems EVSSO offers a generic measurement scheme and is therefore applicable to many different e-voting systems, especially DRE voting machines. It cannot be applied to internet election systems because they are inherently insecure \(no secret or free suffrage, coercion and vote buying, denial of service attacks, no possibility for reasonable and authentic auditmechanisms, and other risks\ [3, 8, 12   3.3. Core Areas of the EVSSO Method  EVSSO evaluates various aspects of security Through their assessment, strengths, and weaknesses Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


of security measures can be pinpointed. These aspects are also called core areas and are associated with the three main categories of an e-voting system: hardware software, and human factors Hardware   compliance with election principles   safety   physical security   cryptography Software   compliance with election principles   data integrity   cryptography   transparency   software engineering   protection of software Human factors   compliance with election principles   security management   user interface   transparency   organization of election   validation of independent testing authorities The EVSSO method is based on the fundamental legal principles of elections in European democracies but can be applied to most e-voting systems in democratic republics as most democracies have the same legal basis regarding elections  3.4. Levels of the EVSSO Method  The EVSSO method describes 16 core areas, each of which is categorized into one of three levels. These levels are defined in a way that moving up from one level to a higher one constitutes a significant improvement of the quality of security The three levels are labeled A, B, and C. In some of the core areas only level A, or A and B, are defined, in other areas all three levels are applied. The criteria to meet a specific level are clearly defined for every core area. Some of the criteria for a certain level are detailed and contain many requirements which must be met in order to attain this level. Others are more compact. A detailed list of the criteria for meeting a certain level can be found in the appendix, chapter 6 The core areas and levels are displayed in the EVSSO matrix \(see figure 1\ which visualizes priorities and dependencies of the levels By using this level system, the current situation of security can be clearly defined for every core area This procedure also shows incremental improvements in the security of the assessed system by looking at the criteria of the higher level that was not reached  Fig. 1: The EVSSO Matrix  For the evaluation of an e-voting system, a detailed checklist with criteria and qualifications for achieving a certain level is used. A level can only be reached if all of its requirements are met. If only some of the points of a higher level are accomplished but all conditions of a lower level are met, the core area has to be set to the latter one  3.5. The EVSSO Matrix  The vertical axis of the matrix lists the core areas the horizontal axis shows the maturity level the evoting system was classified into. The maturity levels from 0 to 10 in the matrix are not numeric values for the security of an e-voting system but are merely used Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


to position the different levels. The empty boxes mark the gap between the levels that have to be passed in order to achieve a higher level. A classification into more than one level \(A, B, or C\ time is not possible, i.e. it is not sufficient to meet only some criteria of the next higher level \(e.g. B\; as long as the voting system does not satisfy all criteria of B, it is classified as level A The positions of the levels present priorities and dependencies. The different levels are not equally important from the point of view of security; for example: level A of core area 5 is more important than level A of core area 15. These priorities are displayed through the EVSSO matrix. The levels of the core areas with higher priorities are placed to the right of the levels of core areas that are not as important The EVSSO matrix not only shows priorities but also dependencies among certain levels of various core areas. The levels of the core areas on the left hand side have a higher priority than the levels on the right hand side and the higher the priority, the greater the influence on the maturity of the security of the e-voting system is Dependencies between the levels are also expressed by the positions of the levels: some levels can only be reached after all conditions of another level are met Such levels whose requirements have to be met first are positioned on the left hand side of the levels that depend on them In the EVSSO matrix, the different levels are mapped to a certain maturity level of security, of which there are ten. The categorization of the core areas shows the maturity level with respect to the quality of the e-voting system's security. Level C is always on the right hand side of level B and therefore higher than B level B is higher than A. The security increases with the level. The higher \(and more secure\e level, the more to the right it is placed. Integrity checks \(a criterion in level B of core area 10\or instance only make sense after a certain standard of quality has been reached \(level A of core area 9  4. Evaluation of an E-Voting System with the EVSSO Method  An individual EVSSO matrix is filled out for every e-voting system by critically analyzing the system and determining the level of every single core area. The levels which have been reached are marked green in the matrix. The levels that have not been reached are marked red. The boxes between the levels are also colored. If a core area has not even reached level A level 0 is marked green. The boxes between an achieved level and the next higher level are left blank white\ order to show the gap between those levels For every core area, a short explanation should be given for why a certain level was reached. This enables others to understand the evaluation method and its conclusions A fictitious example for a filled-out EVSSO matrix is shown in figure 2 The coloration of the matrix offers a clear description of the security situation of an e-voting system. Areas colored in red show optimization potential for the security of the assessed e-voting system, green areas show the accomplished maturity level of security  Fig. 2: Example of a filled-out EVSSO matrix after the assessment of an e-voting system  The maturity level can be read in the matrix by looking at the levels accomplished. A particular maturity level is reached when the column of this level contains only green or white boxes. In the example above, the maturity level is 1 because maturity level 1 is the right-most column not containing any red squares. The maturity level is just a means and not a numeric value for the system The necessary order for optimization measures can also be derived from the maturity level of the matrix The vertical column containing the red squares is a checklist of requirements to be fulfilled in order to ascend to the next higher level. The matrix also shows the priority of the measures to be taken: by working from left to right in the diagram crucial measures are handled before less important ones In the example above, level A of core area 4 should be prioritized, because if this level is reached the maturity level of the e-voting system will take a leap and jump from 1 to 3. The objective of the optimization is to reach maturity level 10  5. Conclusion  Security is a value that is difficult to evaluate as it is not easy to quantify. The method introduced offers a qualitative evaluation scheme that suggests specific Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


steps for optimization and an increase in security of an e-voting system Besides a descriptive and simple visualization of the quality of security and a clear evaluation of an evoting system, the matrix of the EVSSO method offers step-by-step optimization suggestions. The main purpose of the EVSSO matrix is to show the strengths and weaknesses of security measures of an e-voting system and to give a clear view of the security situation and possible optimizations. The requirements to meet a certain level provide general recommendations for improvements, from which specific measures can be derived Applying this method does not guarantee an improvement of security but it offers an approach to structure the necessary steps in a better way. The EVSSO method identifies security holes and vulnerabilities and offers suggestions to achieve a higher security level As of now, this method is a theoretical approach and has not yet been applied in a case study. It can be used as a basis for governmental certifications or a future Common Criteria protection profile One of the problems this method shows is the difficulty of defining security in specific terms Security in elections supported electronically cannot be measured in absolute numbers. A system can never be considered 100 % secure because such a system can simply not be developed. In an environment as complex as this one, too many things have to be factored in, and in software development finding all bugs in any non-trivial application is virtually not achievable as  6.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
