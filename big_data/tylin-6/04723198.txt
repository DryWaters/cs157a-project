Secondly, the signs position and size in visual field are adjusted properly based on spatio-temporal relativity. Finally the signs are detected according to the extracted SIFT \(Scale Invariant Feature Transform\ features. Experiments by this new method on ATSR show that public information signs are detected rapidly and precisely  Keywords- Multi-scales spatio-temporal information; Public information sign; SIFT features; Airport terminal  service robot I   I NTRODUCTION  In recent years, robots have been gradually applied to many kinds of airport services. For instance: luggage pointing, guided tours, patrols and so on. In this paper, ASR is a kind of mobile robot indoor which is used to meet services in terminal Accurate localization in robot is a key to achieve decency and service functions in real-time, and whether the public information signs are detected is an important premise for localization, so real-time public information sign detection poses a complex problem for ASR. Based on the standard of China's civil aviation [1   p u b l i c in f o rm atio n s i g n s c o m p o s e d  o f  graphical symbols are used to guide passengers in terminal ticket office. In our work, public information signs which are composed graphical symbols or letters are used in terminal public information signs are called public signs for short in the next context\, for instance inquiry and luggage storage public signs. There is no uniform method to detect objects, in which most of sign detection are traffic \(road\ signs. Up to now little information referred in other papers is related to our research Normally, sign detection is based on extracting color or shape features to segment and classify, but there is some influence condition: illumination conditions, direction of sign’s face status of paint on signs, placement of multiple signs near each other, torn and variations in sign’s scale, obstacles etc, so problems of false detection bought out [2 3 4  T h i s p a pe r addresses the problem of vision focused on public sign detection in terminal for the system of ASR. Due to the particularity in spatial position, there are some difficulties in the detection processing:\(1\ape features can not be extracted easily for the distortion of public signs in the image;\(2\Because the public signs locate dispersedly, sometimes public signs are missed or only part of the sign is in the image;\(3\Images contained signs are in low resolution, so they are hard to detect;\(4\Public signs are occluded mutually in images, so most existing splitting approaches by making use of morphology [5 or histogram [6 ar e i n v a l i dat e d In al l u s i on  t o t h es es  pr o b l e m s  above, a new method based on multi-scales and spatiotemporal information is presented. In our method  public signs are searched fast by making use of stabilization of image edge in big space scale, while there is plenty of detail information in small space scale image [7   8   9    1 0  im ag in g p o s i t i on  ar e changed automatically based on spatio-temporal relativity of public signs: imaging position of public sign is corrected continuously by establishing a detection window and image is extracted SIFT features[1  an d  1 2 in v a r i ou s s p ac e s c a l es  in  search for the prior space scale, over these phases public sign detection is finished II  D ETECTION OF P UBLIC S IGN B ASED ON M ULTI SCALES AND S PATIO TEMPORAL I NFORMATION  The whole detection processing is composed of three phases in succession: \(1\ Fast searching for public signs in big space scale; \(2\ Public sign detection by spatio-temporal changing; \(3\ Searching for prior space scale based on extracting SIFT features A  Fast Searching for Public Signs in Big Space Scale Based on the standard of China's civil aviation [1  t h er e  must be intense contrast between graphical symbols and color grounding in public signs.

 Figure 1  The frame of searching for public signs in big space scale The position calibration of robot’s head is defined by L  p tz p expresses as pan position, t expresses as tilt position and z represents the zoom value, due to the reason of public sign’s height in space, the tilt searching scope is regulated  t 002\002   1 002 is the threshold determined by robot’s viewpoint scope and the height of public signs in space. Blue grounding has been used in most terminals. The main task of this phase is to segment the input image and extract out the areas that contain public sign patterns, color feature is extracted first. The raw input image is transformed from the original RGB color space to the HSV color space. Next, objects in the binary image are extracted using the connected components labeling algorithm Finally every ROI \(Region of interest,\ is signed by center coordinates, width and height in the raw image, so as to the public signs are searched fast in big space scale image Public sign images from different sites or in different illumination status \(see Fig. 2\ were picked up in order to obtain the thresholds of HSV. There was another interfere because of the mirrors in the surrounding, public signs could be reflected by the mirror and virtual public sign images may be detected, \(see Fig. 3\(a\, so S value must be regulated more reasonably.

When public signs are detected by robot in real time, a number of issues may do effect detection. Some problematic public sign images will be presented. \(see Fig. 5    a\                                            \(b  c  Figure 5  Seleted public sign images for detection. \(a\ one part of the public sign in the image. \(b\one public sign occluded by the other. \(c\ one blurred public sign in the image By taking into the synthesis of all the information aforementioned, spatio-temporal changing method is designed as followed \(see Fig. 6   Figure 6  The frame of spatio-temporal changing Step1: The parameter L is obtained from current robot’s position, and center coordinates   00 i Xxy  i W and i H are achieved to express the ROI sequence. ROI are detected in the order of i S value from big to small i S is expressed as  i S  i W  i H 3 Step2: The occluded public signs in images are processed by threshold 003  003 is defined as the ratio between width and height of normal public sign, when  1.5 2 W i H i 003\003  4 ROI is considered to be two sign regions and two virtual center coordinates are defined to be      ii TxyH xy   1.5 0  1.5 0  0 xx W i xx W i yy y 000  000 000  000 000 000  000 5  Step 3: In this phase, a detection window is presented originally, where the detection window is expressed as that the window is being sized to m pixels x m pixels , and the window center is the same as the center of the input image, the m value is determined by velocity of robot’s head and size of input image. The motion control vector OX 000J\000J\000J\000K is constructed, and robot’s head is controlling by vector OX 000J\000J\000J\000K  Step4:In the processing of motion, the center coordinates of ROI is   00 i X xy in the foregoing frame, the input image is scanning inversely compared with OX 000J\000J\000J\000K in which   00 i X xy  and 004 are taken as the scanning initial point, scanning step respectively [13 a nd 14 002 004 is the longest moving step of center coordinates between two sequential frame. Then decision depending on temporal relativity is made as followed if the ROI limited is detected again, it proves to the reality of detection result in the foregoing frame, keep detecting this ROI, or else stop searching for the ROI limited. Carry out processing above time and again until X coordinates is in the detection window scope Step5: Space scale is reduced at the speed of v, once the space scale is changed, the ROI is detected by some criteria to search for the prior space scale, the image in the prior space scale will be the result image Step6: Resume the initial position L, switch to the step 1 to carry through detecting the next ROI, the changing phrase is ended until all the ROI are detected C  Searching for Prior Space Scale Based on Extracting SIFT Features Space scale could be enhanced by adjusting zoom value of the camera in robot’s head and the resolution of images can be enhanced [15  b u t i f t h e s p ac e s c a l e i s  c h a nged w i t h o u t an y  criteria, system is time-consuming as well as redundant, the detection efficiency will fall.

The features are highly distinctive and they can describe the environment excellently. A plenty of images contained public signs collected from terminals were used to do experiments: these images were M1 pixels x N1 pixels. Public sign regions were extracting SIFT features and SIFT feature numbers were increased nonlinearly followed by the enhancing of the space scale, when the numbers reached to or exceeded M for object recognition, results were correct in most samples, these features were accurately described the public signs in terminals

Tianjin airport terminal and Beijing N0.3 airport terminal were chosen as our testing circumstances, Fig. 7 showed the scene that robot was in terminal. This part was implemented in the windows platform and Visual Studio 6.0 development environment. By using decision system, the system performed well on public information sign detection by motion control of robot’s head The image was 320 pixels x 240 pixels, the detection window was limited at 10 pixels x 10 pixels, and the detection edge of public signs in terminal were drew in white thick lines     Figure 7  The “fuwa” ASR image A  Experiments in Tianjin Airport Terminal Experiment 1: In this experiment, images with the public signs in bad status were used to test the searching algorithm in big space scale \(see Fig. 8 Set1: the image contained public signs where illuminant was in it or not at the same time was used Set2: the image contained public sign in intense illumination and in bad view point was used Set3: the image contained public signs in different illumination status was used. The public signs were not well reflected by light in the image This experiment sets also contained another 40 public information sign images in terminal.

Multi-information involved space scale, spatio-temporal information were synthesized in the method. The detection module performed very well in real time on the public signs under various statuses: public signs were missed, part of a public sign was in the image, too small public sign images were captured and some public signs were occluded by other signs in the image moreover, it was achieved robustly on the robot at real-time performance in different environments  R EFERENCES  1  The Standard of China’s civil aviation MH00005-1997 http://www.biaozhi.net.html 2  Gareth Loy, Nick Barnes, “Fast Shape-based Road Sign Detection for a Driver Assistance System”, In: Proc. of the IEEE IRSJ Int.

error either across the entire image or speci\002cally in areas not adjacent to object edges The reconstruction algorithm then employs the binary mask to select the appropriate portions of each preliminary reconstructed image and then combine them into a single 002nal image During evolution of the 002lter designed to reduce error near edges the entire training image is reconstructed but 002tness is only calculated at the pixel positions located within the black portions of the mask enclosing the edges identi\002ed by the edge detection algorithm for the provided training image This approach forces the GA to evolve a 002lter that improves image reconstruction near object edges Section 5 describes the development of this 002lter The 002lter used to reconstruct the remaining areas of images may be optimized to either reduce error across an entire image or to speci\002cally reduce the error in the portions of an image not adjacent to object edges 050not selected by the binary mask\051 These two approaches are contrasted in section 6 For clarity we refer to 002lters evolved using the entire image as globally evolved 002lters and to 002lters evolved using the edge-enclosing masks as locally evolved 002lters Locally evolved 002lters are optimized either for the edge-adjacent or non-edge-adjacent portions of images as noted 4 P RELIMINARY E XPERIMENTS The edge detection algorithm generates a greyscale image isolating the edges within a satellite image as shown in 002gure 6 Edges are then isolated through the generation of a binary mask separating dark pixels from light pixels in the edge image Our initial experiments seek to identify an appropriate pixel shade threshold for binary mask generation that ultimately provides improved image reconstruction near object edges Preliminary analysis indicates satisfactory MSE results using appropriate mask threshold determination on selected satellite images Mask Threshold Determination The creation of the binary mask used to isolate the edge portions of the training image requires a set threshold This threshold dictates the required strength of the edge detection output for a given pixel position to be considered part of an edge for the mask In the range 0 000   lower thresholds select fewer areas of the image as edges Higher thresholds enclose a higher portion of the training image To determine an appropriate setting for the edge threshold several GA runs are conducted using the U.S Air Force museum image from 002gure 2 At a quantization level of 64 and one level of decomposition the MSE of the image reconstructed using the Daub4 DWT 000 1 is 138.13 A globally evolved 002lter used as a baseline for comparison achieves a reconstruction MSE of 106.108 representing a reduction of 23.18 Local 002lters for the reconstruction of object edges are evolved using edge masks generated at various threshold settings ranging from 48 up to 192 Recall that during evolution MSE 002tness is only assessed near the object edges of the training image as Figure 9   MSE improvement in masked region of edgeevolved 002lter against Daub4 wavelet 050dashed\051 and globally evolved 002lter 050dotted\051 indicated by the mask created at the given threshold At each threshold the locally evolved 002lter response is compared to the Daub4 DWT 000 1 response and the globally evolved 002lter response for the edge portions of the training image isolated by the mask The  reductions in MSE of the local 002lter against the global 002lter and the wavelet are plotted in 002gure 9 The local 002lters exhibit a reduction typically ranging from 14\22616 against the Daub4 wavelet Against the globally evolved 002lter the local 002lters demonstrate an improvement of 21.30 at a conservative threshold of 48 The degree of improvement steadily declines as the threshold increases but remains signi\002cant at thresholds below 120 This makes sense because at low thresholds only dark positions of the edge detection algorithm indicating large intensity transitions between neighboring pixels 050strong edges\051 are encompassed by the mask images At higher thresholds the masks are less selective and encompass larger portions of the image The two plots cross at a threshold of 112 at this point the responses of the wavelet and the globally evolved 002lter are approximately equal From this point the wavelet outperforms the global 002lter in the mask-encompassed portion of the image to an increasing degree as the threshold decreases The reverse is true as the threshold increases This con\002rms that the globally evolved 002lter while reducing error across the entire image actually increases reconstruction error near object edges However the locally evolved 002lters provide consistent improvement near object edges Figure 10 plots the overall reduction in MSE with the image reconstructed using the combined locally and globally evolved 002lters versus the globally evolved 002lter alone at each tested threshold level Improvement ranges from 1.98\2262.25 at thresholds under 120 with the best performance coming at a threshold of 104 At this threshold the MSE reduces from 106.11 to 103.72 a reduction of 2.25 While this may not 7 


Figure 10   MSE improvement for entire image using combined reconstruction over reconstruction with globally evolved 002lter only seem to be a signi\002cant improvement across the entire image this improvement occurs strictly near object edges such as building outlines or aircraft pro\002les The portions of the image most critical for intelligence analysis demonstrate signi\002cantly improved reconstruction Performance on Selected Satellite Images The results above demonstrate trends in 002lter response but because each is the result of a single GA run on a single image statistically sound conclusions may not yet be drawn In order to assess the performance of the proposed technique on a wider range of conditions replicated GA experiments are conducted at multiple threshold levels for the four satellite images presented in 002gure 5 For each image a global reconstruction 002lter is evolved as well as an edge-isolated local 002lter using masks created at threshold levels 48 88 and 104 in a single experimental replication Fifteen total replications are conducted for each image The responses of the wavelet the globally evolved 002lter and the locally evolved 002lter are recorded at each threshold level for the mask-enclosed portion of the image Table 1  MSE of images reconstructed with Daub4 wavelet and globally evolved 002lters Table 1 presents the MSE of each image reconstructed with the Daub4 DWT 000 1 and the average MSE achieved with the globally evolved 002lters across all replications Evolved 002lters reduce MSE by between 13.57 and 20.51 on average deTable 2   of images covered by masks created at each threshold Table 3  Mean  MSE reduction in area enclosed by masks using combined 002lter reconstruction pending on the image The masks created for each threshold encompass varying amounts of the training images Table 2 provides the  of each image enclosed by the masks for each threshold value The masks for the Baghdad image encompass between 24.67 and 41.56 of the image as seen in 002gure 7 050top right\051 the large number of structures in this image lead to a large number of edges in the image The remaining images are much more edge sparse with the Air Force museum image containing the smallest percent covered by the edge mask The locally evolved 002lters are compared within the maskenclosed regions for each image in table 3 This table shows the average reduction of MSE over the wavelet 050top\051 and over the evolved 002lters 050bottom\051 for the given image The best result and any results not statistically signi\002cantly different are shown in bold for each image T-tests at signi\002cance level 013  0  05 provides assessments of the differences between results Within the mask-enclosed region the local 002lters perform very well compared to the wavelet The threshold value does not appear to strongly in\003uence performance 8 


Table 4  Mean  MSE reduction of entire images using combined 002lter reconstruction for the given images The local 002lters demonstrate the best performance at a threshold of 104 for two images and only slightly lower than the best performance for the two remaining images Compared to the globally evolved 002lters the local 002lters show signi\002cantly improved results for three of four images with the best performance typically coming at a threshold of 48 consistent with the plot in 002gure 9 demonstrating greater improvement over the globally evolved 002lter at smaller threshold values The locally evolved 002lters provide only minor improvement over the global 002lters for the Baghdad image Recall from table 2 this image contains the greatest degree of edge transitions Filters trained on this image exert a relatively large amount of selective pressure on 002lters providing improved reconstruction near object edges Images containing fewer edges provide less evolutionary pressure preferring improved reconstruction across the entire image at the expense of reconstruction near edges Table 4 shows MSE improvement when combining the global and local 002lters for reconstruction The top portion shows improvement over the Daub4 DWT 000 1 when the mask-covered portion of the image is reconstructed with the local 002lter and the remainder with the wavelet Because masks enclose a small portion of each image improvement is modest These small gains are measured across the entire image though all improvement comes near edges  Not surprisingly the greatest error reduction comes for the Baghdad image containing the largest mask coverage The best improvement comes at a mask threshold of 104 for each image consistent with the trends illustrated in 002gure 10 The lower portion of table 4 provides results seen for reconstruction using both local and global evolved 002lters over use of globally-evolved 002lters alone The Baghdad image demonstrates the smallest improvements this image provides suf\002cient selection pressure for edge reconstruction as a training image The remaining images show reconstruction improvement of between 2.22 and 3.41 even though a relatively small portion of each image is covered by the mask The best improvements typically occur at the 104 threshold where a larger amount of image coverage provides greater room for improvement 5 R ECONSTRUCTION A DJACENT TO E DGES Because image transforms evolved for global reconstruction of an entire image demonstrate increased error near object edges we place emphasis upon the reduction of reconstruction error near edges The evolution of a robust image 002lter for near-edge reconstruction requires the identi\002cation of training images that result in 002lters that perform well on the reconstruction of unseen images 50 GA runs are conducted to evolve 002lters for near-edge reconstruction Each run employs one of the 50 unique available satellite images as the training image Images are referenced according to their number in the satellite image set as reported in the 002rst image would be referred to as sat01 The GA attempts to minimize the MSE within the edge-adjacent portions of the training image during 002lter evolution After evolution the resulting reconstruction 002lter's performance is assessed across all 50 satellite images We suspect that the abundance of object edges within a training image may in\003uence its performance as a training image For each evolved 002lter 002gure 11 plots the average  MSE reduction near edges compared to the Daub4 DWT 000 1 002lter obtained across all 50 images plotted against the  of that 002lter's training image enclosed by the binary edge detection mask obtained at a mask generation threshold of 88 050see section 4\051 From this plot it appears that there is a loose correlation between training image edge abundance and the performance of that image's corresponding evolved 002lter performance Training images with fewer than 10 of their pixels near object edges perform significantly worse than the Daub4 DWT 000 1 002lter On the other hand several images with greater than 25 of pixels near edges result in 002lters providing an average MSE reconstruction improvement near edges of approximately 17 Not all images with an abundance of pixels near edges provide strong performance as training images however It appears that the abundance of pixels near object edges is an important factor in the training performance of images but there may be other important factors as yet unidenti\002ed that play an important role in training image performance as well Images in the satellite set are also ranked according to their reconstruction dif\002culty as test images For each test image the  MSE improvement over the DWT 000 1 002lter is averaged across each of the 50 evolved transform 002lters The average improvement for each test image is plotted against the  of pixels near edges in 002gure 12 Some images are very dif\002cult for the evolved 002lters to reconstruct while others demonstrate an average improvement of nearly 10 over the DWT 000 1 002lter regardless of the evolved 002lter used Based on the seemingly random distribution of points in the plot there does not 9

7 D ISCUSSION The image reconstruction scheme illustrated in 002gure 8 requires two separate evolved reconstruction 002lters one for reconstruction of the image near object edges and the other for reconstruction away from edges The 002lters presented in equations 7 and 9 are optimized to reconstruct the edgeadjacent and non-edge adjacent portions of images respectively Using these combined 002lters to reconstruct all of the satellite images results in a mean MSE improvement of 16.53 with a standard deviation of 1.91 The improvement ranges from a minimum of 8.94 up to a maximum of 20.59 In contrast the best globally evolved 002lter in equation 8 only provides a mean improvement of 15.21 with a standard deviation of 1.78 Overall improvement with the global 002lter ranged from 8.83 up to 19.04 Our proposed image reconstruction approach utilizing edge and non-edgetargeted optimized 002lters improves upon the performance of both the Daub4 DWT 000 1 002lter and the best identi\002ed globallyevolved 002lter By utilizing 002lters optimized for high-spacial frequency changes for reconstruction near edges and 002lters optimized for low-spacial frequency changes for non-edgeadjacent edges we are able to realize better reconstruction resolution than a single 002lter optimized for an entire image permits The successful optimization of robust image transforms requires the careful selection of an appropriate image for training during evolution The scatter plot in 002gure 11 demonstrates the importance of training image selection Several training images result in 002lters that fail to improve upon the performance of the standard inverse wavelet transform in the reconstruction of the collected satellite images This is due to overtraining by the genetic algorithm The GA discovers a 002lter that provides strong reconstruction of the supplied training image but the resulting 002lter does not generalize well to the remaining satellite images and may provide signi\002cantly worse performance than the wavelet Though we recognize the importance of training image selection to the ultimate performance of the resulting evolved image 002lters the identi\002cation of salient image features governing an image's suitability for GA training remains an open research question Figure 13 shows the 002ve best training images for near-edge reconstruction 002lter optimization while 002gure 14 shows the 002ve worst images Filters trained upon the best images provide strong performance across the entire satellite image set In contrast 002lters trained using the worst images demonstrate very poor performance While there appears to be a loose correlation between performance and the number of near-edge pixels in the training image 050see 002gure 11\051 there are likely other factors at play as well These factors may include the distribution of light and dark pixel intensities in the image the shape and direction of long and short object edges or the rotational axis of the training image relative to the distribution of object edges The good training images tend to contain many small boxed objects such as houses oil storage tanks and hangers while the poor training edges contain fewer buildings The distribution of buildings/small geometric objects may in\003uence an image's training performance in an as yet unforseen manner Future research should focus upon the factors impacting an image's suitability as a GA training sample This may lead to the identi\002cation of improved training samples outside of the current image database and thus leading to greater performance from evolved image 002lters 8 C ONCLUSIONS Existing techniques of 002lter evolution potentially provide signi\002cant improvement over standard wavelet transforms but they may increase the error present near the edges of objects Image processing applications such as target recognition and intelligence gathering cannot afford this resolution loss in the most critical sections of the image The use of an edge detection algorithm and an edge-enclosing mask allows the evolution of reconstruction 002lters that improve the reconstruction resolution near object edges by as much as 20 under conditions subject to high quantization error Likewise 002lters evolved with emphasis upon the reconstruction of pixels not adjacent to object edges outperform existing 002lter optimization techniques through the remaining portions of images By ignoring edges such 002lters demonstrate an improved response over globally evolved 002lters to the edge-sparse portions of images Reconstruction combining 002lters optimized for near edge and non-edge adjacent performance provides a robust reconstruction algorithm suitable for applications requiring maximum object resolution while maintaining maximal compression ratios Results indicate that there may exist a correlation between the degree of edges within an image and the potential improvement a locally evolved 002lter may provide Future experiments should focus on images containing a wide range of edge sparseness or abundance while studying the in\003uence of other image properties upon a given image's suitability as a training sample Experiments should focus on the determination of appropriate mask creation thresholds for images of various edge abundance These experiments will lead to the development of a system that given an image determines the appropriate threshold setting and selection of appropriate 002lters from a library of previously evolved 002lters Recent related research has focused upon the optimization of image transform 002lters of greater length and complexity designed to outperform wavelets at greater levels of multiple resolution analysis regardless of quantization level As the complexity of evolved transforms increases the separation of the reconstruction task into unique 002lters for the reconstruction of pixels adjacent and non-adjacent to object edges may be of further bene\002t Further research will establish the performance of this reconstruction strategy upon increasingly complex image transform 002lters Lossy image processing systems that maintain high resolution near object edges improve the amount of useful intelligence 12

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
