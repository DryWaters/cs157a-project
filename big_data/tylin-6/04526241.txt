The data obtained, complemented by continuing observations from the Cassini spacecraft, show methane lakes, river 
channels and drainage basins sand dunes, cryovolcanos and sierras. This has lead to an enormous scientific interest in a follow-up mission to Titan, using a robotic lighter-than-air vehicle \(or aerobot\s have modest power requirements, can fly missions with extended durations, and have very long distance trav erse capabilities. They can execute regional surveys, transport and deploy scientific instruments and in-situ laboratory facilities over vast distances, and also provide surface sampling at strategic science sites. This paper describes our progress in the development of the autonomy technologies that will be required for exploration of Titan. We provide an overview of the autonomy architecture and some of its key components. We also show results obtained from autonomous flight tests conducted in the Mojave desert

It has an atmosphere with a surface density of 5.55 kg/m 3 4.6 times the density of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level\, and an estimated composition of 95% nitrogen, 3 methane and 2% argon.

  3 3  A EROBOT A UTONOMY A RCHITECTURE  The main challenges for aerobot exploration of Titan include: large communication latencies, with a round trip light time of approximately 2.4 hours; extended communication blackout periods with a duration of approximately 8 Earth days, caused by the tidally locked rotation of Titan in its orbit around Saturn; extended mission duration, currently projected to be on the order of six months to one year; and operation in a substantially unknown environment, with very little data on wind patterns, meteorological conditions, and only low-resolution radar maps of surface topogra phy obtained from Cassini These challenges lead to several desired capabilities for a Titan aerobot: vehicle safing, so that the integrity of the aerobot can be ensured over the full duration of the mission and during extended communi cation blackouts; accurate and robust autonomous flight control, including deployment, long traverses, hovering/station-keeping, and touch-and-go surface sampling spatial mapping and selflocalization in the absence of a global positioning system on Titan; and advanced perceptual hazard and target recognition, tracking and visual servoing, allowing the aerobot to detect and avoid atmospheric and topographic hazards, and also to identify home in, and keep station over pre-defined science targets or terrain features. It should be noted, however, that a variety of mission scenarios can be implemented with a subset of these autonomy capabilities   In preparation for a future Titan mission, we are developing an aerobot autonomy architectur e that integrates accurate and robust vehicle and flight trajectory control, perceptionbased state estimation, hazar d detection and avoidance vehicle health monitoring and reflexive safing actions multi-modal vehicle localiza tion and mapping, autonomous science, and long-range mission planning and monitoring Fig. 3   Figure 3. Aerobot autonomy architecture with major subsystems Lower level functions in the autonomy architecture include sensor and actuator control, vehicle state estimation, flight mode control, supervisory flight control, and flight profile execution. Intermediate level functions include vehicle health monitoring, failure detection, identification and recovery \(FDIR\, flight trajectory and profile planning, and image-based navigation. The latter provides GPSindependent localization, as well as local and regional mapping. Higher-level functions include mission planning resource management, and mission execution and monitoring In this paper we concentrate on the flight control, vehicle simulation and onboard navigation systems. This includes development of a robust flight control system based on vehicle aerodynamic modeling, system simulation for robust control law development and testing, and vehicle system identification; and accurate vehicle multi-sensor state estimation methods, using both inertial and vision-based motion and position estimation 4  T HE JPL  A EROBOT T ESTBED  The current prototype JPL aerobot testbed \(Fig. 4\s based on an Airspeed Airship AS-800B  The ai rshi p specifications are: length of 11 m, diameter of 2.5 m, total volume of 34 m 3 two 2.3 kW \(3 hp 3 1.4 cu inch fuel engines, double catenary gondola suspension, control surfaces in an “X” configuration, maximum speed of 13 m/s 25 kts\maximum ceiling of 1000 m, average mission endurance of 60 minutes, static lift payload of 12 kg ASL and dynamic lift payload of up to 16 kg ASL. The avionics and communication systems are installed in the gondola The aerobot avionics system is built around a PC-104 computer architecture. The pr ocessor stack has a serial board interface to the navigation sensors, a PWM board for reading pulsewidth modulated signals from the human safety pilot and generating PWM signals based upon control surface commands from the avionics software, and an IEEE 1394 board for sending commands to, and reading image data from, the navigation and science cameras. Wireless serial modems provide data/control telemetry links between the aerobot and the ground sta tion, and additional video transmitters on the aerobot pr ovide downlinks of video imagery to the ground station. The safety pilot can always reassert “pilot override” control over the aerobot The navigation sensors currently consist of an IMU \(angular rates, linear accelerations\pass and inclinometer for absolute 3D position\sion sensors include two down-looking navigation cameras, one with a 360 o x 180 o field of view and another with a narrower F OV. Additionally, we have a laser altimeter \(surface relative altitude\a barometric altimeter \(absolute altitude ASL\d an ultrasonic anemometer \(for relative wind field measurements The ground station is composed of a laptop, a graphical user interface to the vehicle, wirele ss data and video links, video monitors and VCRs, and a differential GPS \(DGPS station that provides 3D vehicle position estimates with an 


  4 accuracy on the order of centimet ers. Field tests of the JPL aerobot are conducted at the El Mirage dry lake site in the Mojave desert \(Fig. 4 It should be noted that our testbed is not meant to be a high fidelity prototype of a Titan b limp, but rather a convenient platform for autonomy technology development   Figure 4: The JPL aerobot during autonomous flight tests. These flight tests were conducted at the El Mirage dry lake in the Mojave desert. The upper image shows liftoff, and the bottom image shows the airship in autonomous flight mode  5  A EROBOT A ERODYNAMIC M ODELING  The aerobot flight control system being developed is based on: \(1\system modeling, which includes aerodynamic airship sensor and actuator, and environmental modeling 2\stem identification for aerodynamic parameter estimation; \(3\model and control system validation in a physically based simulation environment; and \(4\flight testing on the aerobot testbed The aerodynamic model developed for the JPL airship is significantly different from fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft aerodynamic models, as the virtual mass and inertia properties of the displaced atmospheric volume are substantial when compared with those associated with the vehicle itself. Additionally, an aerobot is characterized by having different flight modes \(take-off/landing, stationkeeping/hovering, loitering, ascent/descent, high-speed cruise, low-speed flight require alternative actuator control strategies and flight control algorithms. Important airship flight control challenges include non-minimum phase behavior and oscillatory modes at low speeds, timevarying behavior due to altitude variations, and variable efficiency of the actuators depending on aerobot speed   We developed a new nonlinear robotic airship model intended for control system design and evaluation. The model brings together much of the previous airship modeling results available in the literature, and adds new elements to extend the model’s range of applicability. In addition, it is built from a systems-design-control interaction perspective, in which physical elements are parameterized to easily make design changes as control systems are designed and evaluated. The kinematic and dynamic equations of the model are based in part on Ref 14, and are not repeated here due to space constraints The aerodynamic model developed has the ability to characterize all four primary modes of flight \(launch, cruise hover, landing\ake the model as versatile as possible for changing flight conditions and optimization studies, all airship dimensions are given parametric definitions.  The reference frame for the airship is the hull center of volume and is defined using a North-East-Down orientation, as is typically done with aircraft Initial validation of the model was done running various simulations and assessing the vehicle.  We summarize below some of the results; a complete description of the model, a more extensive set of validation experiments, and the corresponding results are found in Ref. 14 Forward Motion Both thrusters were given a step input of 4 N with zero angle relative to the airship; the fins had zero deflection The airship had V 0 0 and started at an elevation of 5m. As expected, the airship initially pitches upward as it loses altitude \(Fig. 5 to the engines whereas the heaviness condition \(negative buoyancy\he vehicle causes the drop in elevation.  As the airship gains speed, the pitch angle begins oscillating about a positive value, creating aerodynamic lift as verified under field conditions Rudder Test Control surface behavior was tested by inputting a -20   deflection angle and repeating the previous test.  The angle represents the deflection of the upper port and upper starboard fins about their center axis. As previously described, the opposing fins are rigidly coupled. This results in a negative slip angle that moves the airship to port. The trajectory in the XY plane gradually converges to a circle Fig. 6, top\s is also shown in Fig. 6 \(bottom\, where the slip angle derivative appro aches zero.  In the XZ plane Fig. 6, center\e airship gains altitude due to the upward 


  5 pitch, as discussed before  Figure 5. Aerodynamic model simulation: forward motion.  The forward motion and the corresponding attack and pitch angles are shown. The z axis points up 6  S IMULATION SYSTEM  The aerobot aerodynamic model developed has been implemented both in Matlab, C, and using the DARTS/Dshell dynamics and real-time simulation system developed at JPL   The form er i s bei ng used for cont rol  system development, while the latter has been used to build a highly flexible simulation platform for aerobot missions The aerobot DARTS/Dshell simulator uses high-fidelity physics model for aerodynamics, mass properties buoyancy, kinematics, dynamics control surfaces, etc., and can also incorporate simulated sensor and a wide variety of terrain models. The aerodynamic model developed in C is integrated with the aerobot flight software and is currently being used for pre-flight controller validation. In the future this integrated model will allow for the use of Model Predictive Control Methods on the JPL Aerobot.    The models are parameterized, so that the simulation can be used to represent many types of airships. The initial implementation is based on parameters for the JPL aerobot We have also developed a GUI to operate the airship controls and monitor the airship response \(Fig. 7 Simulations can be run with or without the GUI. The modeling and implementation work has been largely completed, while the model and simulation validation has been started. A variety of system identification tests will be run using the actual JPL aerobot to obtain accurate estimates for a number of model parameters. Once this is done, the simulation platform can also be used to test control software    Figure 6. Aerodynamic model simulation: rudder deflection. The plots show control surface deflection equivalent to rudder actuation, resulting in a limit cycle flight trajectory. The z axis points up

The simulation system is based on the JP L Darts/Dshell dynamic realtime simulation environment 7  A UTONOMOUS F LIGHT C ONTROL  The autonomous flight system has a layered supervisory control structure \(Fig. 8\ oversees the main flight trajectory modes \(cruise, hover and loiter\ch use ascent, descent, turn and altitude controllers. These in turn command the vehicle attitude and thrust controllers. For an X-tail” configuration, the opposing tail surfaces \(1+3 and 2+4\ed in a coupled mode. This means there is no direct roll control, and also that “pure” elevator and rudder behavior is implemented through actuation of all four control surfaces  Vehicle Actuators  Pitch Yaw Roll V M  V M  Virtual Actuators Controllers Flight Path Control 1+3 CS 2+4 CS Throttle Vectoring Elevator Rudder Ascend Cruise Descend Hold Altitude Turn Flight Trajectory Execution Hover Loiter Supervisory Control Flight Mode Supervisory Control System  Figure 8.  Layered supervisory control structure of the aerobot flight cont rol system.  “CS” stands for the tail control surfaces, which are arranged in an “X” or ruddervator configuration. V M is the trust vector The first version of the onboard flight autonomy system has been implemented using PI controllers for pitch, yaw and altitude control and corresponds to the “controller” and flight path control” levels in the supervisory control architecture \(Fig. 8\e recently added PI controllers for throttle and currently are developing robust lead-lag controllers for pitch, yaw, and altitude control based on aerodynamic models, which will allow us to do accurate 3D trajectory execution. Throttle and thrust vector controllers for hovering operations are currently under development to be scheduled in at low airspeeds. We have also initiated work on using the full aerodynamic model and the associated simulation tools to develop a next generation set of robust controllers, which we expect will demonstrate tighter vehicle control and mo re accurate trajectory control under wind disturbances  Waypoint Flight Control At the flight trajectory execution control level in the supervisory control architecture \(Fig. 8\we have implemented a waypoint flight control system. Waypoints are specified by the operator who also sets the satisfying conditions that define when a waypoint has been considered reached. The approach used is called “orienteering”, where the control objective is define d in terms of reaching the waypoint, rather than in terms of the deviation from a given trajectory  Figure 9. Waypoint flight co ntrol. Top: three waypoints have been reached, with an operator-defined threshold of 25m to the GPS coordinates of the target. Bottom Waypoint flight control und er severe wind disturbances All waypoints were reached.

A waypoint is specified as having been reached if the aerobot is within a Euclidean distance of 25m from the GPS waypoint coordinates. Atmospheric cond itions were moderate, with wind speeds below 5 knots. Fig. 9 \(bottom\ shows an autonomous flight test under substantial wind conditions with gusts up to 10 knots. The airship is blown off the direct waypoint route on several occasions when it is in a beam reach \(orthogonal tive to the wind direction Additionally, it is occasionally yawed off course when heading into or crossing the wind. Nevertheless, the autonomous flight control system was able, even under these severe wind disturbances, to visit all waypoints. We plan to address wind distur bances explicitly through the incorporation of an H  robust controller desi  8  I MAGE B ASED M OTION E STIMATION  Pose \(position and orientation in 6 DOF\and motion estimation is currently done by fusion of IMU and GPS data using a Kalman filter, allowing assessment of the vehicle flight control and trajectory following accuracy. To achieve global and regional localization on Titan in a GPSindependent manner, we are investigating both celestial trackers for ephemerides-based global position estimates and developing an image-based motion estimation \(IBME system with an associated multi-sensor state estimation filter that is used to fuse inertial and visual navigation estimat At t h i s poi nt onl y  i m agery  from  t h e downlooking camera is used \(Fig. 10 Initial results have been very encouraging. The IBME system developed gives us estimates of the pose and motion of the aerobot \(Fig. 11, top\s image mosaicking for visual mapping purposes \(Fig. 11, bottom\, and also recovers 3D terrain structure information An important open issue is the use and performance of an IBME system in support of vehicle localization under the actual lighting conditions on Titan. Estimates of daytime lighting conditions indicate that flight-qualified visual spectrum cameras would be adequate for IBME. We are currently investigating what conditions will be encountered for night time navigation, and whether cameras operating in infrared spectral bands would be required Another open issue is the impact of image texture on IBME performance. Images with few distinctive landmark features or patterns degrade IBME performance, a problem that is also directly related to camera resolution and sensitivity, as well as to the observation altitude of the aerobot. Titan sand dunes fields seem to display repetitive patterns, while hills and coastal areas have significant texture, and methane lake surfaces seem to be largely f eatureless \(except in some of the shallows, where the bottom ma y be visible\e plan to conduct further investigations into IBME performance for different surface texture conditions   Figure 10.

The upper image is from the forward-looking science camera, while the lower image is from the down-looking navigation camera  9  C ONCLUSIONS  LTA systems are a strategic plat form for the exploration of planets and moons with an atmosphere, such as Venus Mars and Titan. Aerobots, in particular, can provide geographically extensive science data at high resolutions and over varied terrains to a degree that cannot be matched by surface-bound rovers or othe r aerial vehicles. At the same time, operation of an aerobot at Titan or other destination in the solar system imposes significant longterm autonomy requirements We outlined above an archit ecture for a substantially autonomous aerobot, described the current JPL aerobot testbed, and discussed initial steps towards the development of an aerobot flight control and navigation systems Our next steps include performing robust system identification, improving the flight control system robustness and accuracy, deve loping a trajectory following system for systematic surveys, and integrating vision-based

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
