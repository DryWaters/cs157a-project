Similar sequences were generated and a big Bank of data SSTDB was created and uploaded for the reference of communication scientists and other IT experts. We concentrated over two aspects firstly how accurately a selfsimilar signal can be generated, secondly how quickly the method can simulate the network traffic signal. A comparative analysis was also done between different types of wavelet transforms for the different values of Hurst parameter. The statistical inaccuracy and time required to produce sequences of a given length are experimentally studied, analyzed and compared  Key words-- FGN; Wavelet; Self-Similar; LRD; Hurst Parameter  I 
 INTRODUCTION  Recent researches showed that the high speed network traffic are characterized by long range dependence LRD processes which are self-similar in natu  ce, an important requirement for conducting simulation studies of communication networks is the ability to generate long synthetic stochastic self-similar sequences. In this paper we implemented and analyzed a fast and accurate pseudorandom self-similar traffic generator, called WBFGN wavelet based fractional Gaussian noise\e generated large database of self-similar network traffic of different length varying from 2 10 to 2 22 using different wavelet families, and their speed and accuracy was analyzed and compared. This large database is called SSTDB \(Self 
Similar Network Traffic Database\which is available on the internet as freewa The remaining structure of paper is organized as Section II describes the long range dependent processes; Section III contains the description of discrete wavelet transform for synthesizing approximate fractional Gaussian noise WBFGN method is presented in section IV. Section V contains the numerical results and their comparisons. The paper is concluded in Section VI   II  LONG RANGE DEPENDENT Long-range dependence is also known as long memory or strong dependence. A good introduction to the topic of long-range dependence is provided by h e term J o s e ph effect was used by Mandelbrot to describe the phenomenon 
A number of definitions of LRD are common in the literature some of these are mentioned here along with their references. The most common measure of LRD is the Hurst parameter H which, for a process exhibiting LRD, is in the range  \(½ ,1 A stationary process t X is said to be long-range dependent if its autocorrelation function   k 002 sums to infinity   003  000 003 003  k k   002 1 
 This definition is sometimes used in the literature, for example in Another way to define the LRD is “A stationary process t X is said to be long range dependent if the absolute value of its autocorrelation function   k 002 sums to infinity   000 003 003  003  k k   002 2  This definition is used by [7 m o re res t rictiv e d e f i n itio n  often used is given by putting conditions on how 
  k 002 decays as 003 004 k  In [8 e f i n e d as, a sta tio n a r y p r o cess t X is said to be long-range dependent if its autocorrelation function   k 002 has the asymptotic form   005 002 002  k c k    3  For some positive constant 002 c and some real  1  0 
 006 005  In this case, the parameter 005 is related to the Hurst parameter by 2 1 005   H Long-range dependence can also be defined in terms of spectral density of a process as The Spectral density   007 f of a function with autocorrelation function   k 002 and variance 2 010 can be defined as

This phenomenon of long-range dependency is not only found in Ethernet traces but also in other high-speed packet networks such as ATM networks etc  III  WAVELET TRANSFORMATION  In this research discrete wavelet transform \(DWT\ was used to simulate fractional Gaussian Noise fGn. Wavelets are complete orthonormal bases which can be used to represent a random time series in two domains: time and frequency. In Hilbert space   2 R L scaled and shifted functions    k m j 012 of wavelets can be represented as    2  2   0 2   m k k j j m j     012 012 5  where j and m are positive integers [9 ce su c h  w a v e let s  are obtained by scaling and shifting a single function   0 k 012 this function is called the mother wavelet Moreover, all base functions    k m j 012 have the same shape as the mother wavelet and therefore are self-similar with each other. For our generator, we used Haar, Daubechies and Coiflets wavelets families, and compare the accuracy and efficiency of these wavelets. The Deubechies wavelets are defined as   000        1 1 2 1  2   1    S i i i i k p k 013 012 6  Where   i p is two-scale sequence of   k 012 and  000    S i i i k p k 2 0  2    013 013 7  A discrete-time process   k X can be represented through the inverse DWT of   000¦\000      S jm m j m j k j S k d X 1 1 2 0       012 8  Where S k 2 0  014 and S is a positive integer which characterizes the limited resolution in time s d m j   are wavelet coefficients which can be obtained through the discrete wavelet transform   000    1 2 0     S t m j k m j k X d 012  9   IV  ALGORITHM OF WBFGN In this analysis we used WBFGN algorithm which is defined in e clai m th at th e FG N an d Dau b ech ie s  wavelet-based transformation is sufficiently fast for practical generation of synthetic self-similar network traffic sequences to be used as simulation input data. The algorithm consists of the following steps  Step 1 Calculate a sequence of values      2 1 n f f f  using Equation \(10  n f f i i   011  corresponding to the spectral density of an fGn process for frequencies i f  ranging between n i  011 and 011       2  2 3 min 2 1    H H f O c H f     007 007 007   10  Where O\(.\resent residual error  Step 2 Multiply i f by realizations of an independent exponential random variable with mean 1 to obtain i f    Step 3 Generate a sequence      2 1 n y y y of complex numbers such that i i f y   and the phase of i y is uniformly distributed between 0 and 011 2 This random phase technique, taken from p r es erv e s th e s p ectral  density corresponding to    i f but ensures that different

 sequences generated using the method will be independent It also ensures that the marginal distribution of the final sequence is normal. The phase randomization makes the different frequency components independent  Step 4 Calculate two synthetic coefficients of orthonormal Daubechies wavelets which are used in the inverse DWT   T h en g e n e rate th e ap prox i m atel y s e l f s i m ilar f G n sequence in the time domain by using the inverse DWT from   i y  Using the above steps, the proposed WBFGN method generates a fast and well approximated self-similar fGn process V  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  The algorithm was implemented in Matlab and executed over a Pentium IV processor of speed 1.6GHz with 760MB of RAM. Large database of Self-Similar Network Traffic was generated using WBFGN method for different values of Hurst parameter ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 with an increment of 0.05. We run the algorithm for different length of sequence starting from 2 10 to 2 22 with the different Wavelet families \(Haar, Daubechies, and Coiflets\r each setting 50 simulated realizations were recorded and then their mean was calculated few results are mentioned here in this paper The whole database is uploaded on the intern o r f r ee access to general people or communication and IT scientists We called this database as SSTDB \(Self-Similar network Traffic Database\his database contains 7150 sequences Tables I, II, III and IV below show the mean execution time in seconds of WBFGN for lengths from 2 10 to 2 20 with H = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9.

The method was implemented using different wavelet families like Daubechies 1, Daubechies 5, Haar and Coiflet 5 and their comparative analysis for simulation time was observed. We found that Daubechies 1 wavelets are fast as compare to others wavelet families. We also checked the simulated signal using different hurst parameter estimation techniques and the percentage relative inaccuracy was studied we found that percentage relative inaccuracy will remains almost below 9% except for one case in which it was 15%.  We have generated large database of Self-Similar Traffic using WBFGN method and a databank was created in which values of H ranging from 0.5 to 1 with an increment of 0.05 for different lengths starting from 2 10 to 2 20 for each setting 50 sequences were generated and stored in SSTDB which is freely available on intern  REFERENCES 1 A b r y P  F Se lla n 1 99 6   T he  w a v e l e tba s e d sy nthe s i s f o r  the fractional Brownian motion " Appl. and Comp.

B.  Identity Information Model RDB Read<Write SQL/PLSQL Relation Enabled Table.1 Difference between Two Storage Modes Fig. 5 Directory Information Tree LDAP Read>Write LDAP API Hierarchy Not Enabled 3\ Identity Information Synchronization A.  Directory Information Tree Structure Different from the attribute change, the identity information destruction should be spread quickly. So, the destruction certificate should be produced and passed on rapidly to ensure that the identity can access nothing from that moment on IV.  M ODEL 220 S A PPLICATION D ESIGN In this section, we will briefly introduce the model\220s application design, which is already being used in a real identity management system of our laboratory. We will not explain the design concretely, but to show the whole view And the concrete information can be different according to the specific appliance. In the model we select LDAP instead of the relation-based database. The differences of them are listed below Through the comparison of LDAP and RDB, we conclude that the main difference is LDAP, which employs a hierarchical storage mode, is more suitable of the mostly read operation. Considering the reality of an organization, where the users and the structures are rarely changed and the structure is level-based, we employ LDAP in our model will consult the LDAP and then pass the result to the identity assurance service. The assurance service will gives out an assertion and produces a ticket. The identity ticket is handed to both the client and the counterpart security domain. Then UIM of the outer security domain will save the ticket and tell the service system whether the user can access the resource The ticket is hold for the future authorization and access control until the user logout. And if the further information is needed, the UIM of the outer domain will consult the local domain the further information. And the authentication engine of the assurance service is responsible to request the authentication service the requested information. Attribute ticket is produced and passed to the requesting part for further use If the user \(at the client\as already been authenticated at his local domain, which means the client has the ticket of some level of the user, and then the user can hand in the ticket directly to the UIM of the outer domain. If the security level of the ticket matches the authentication, the user is allowed to the accessing. Else, the UIM will request the UIM of the user\220s local domain about the further authentication information using the ticket handed by the user. At the user\220s local domain, the ticket is parsed and further information is added to form a new one. The new ticket is handed to both the user to replace the old and the counterpart UIM for the authentication When the user\220s information is changed by the user himself or by the administrator, the correlating change should be made to the existing certificates. So the iden tity assurance service should announce to the user and the outer domain if the change matters much. Or, the changes will be reflected on the new certificate In order to show more clearly about the identity management function, we will cover the resource of an organization. So, the sub trees of an organization include its departments, people and resource. And one of the organization\220s departments is considered another organization node whose sub trees also include the directly managed users and the department\220s resource. Until the lowest level department is added to the information tree, the tree stops expanding The sub trees of every resource node in the tree are the same: application, Windows and Linux. Under the three types of nodes, three kinds of systems can be added separately. And the systems added, which belong to the parent node of resource are the final leaf nodes What we will emphases in the next phase is the sub tree of people. In all, all the sub nodes of people are the users of the parent node-the organization. There are two types of users including ordinary users and the \215common\216 user. We will concretely talk about the design of the user information model 4\ Identity Information Destruction Storag e Read Write Access Method Storage Type Transaction We design two kinds of users in the model in order to enable cross-domain identity mapping. The \215common\216 user is a visual identity, which is not directly used by a person. It is provided to the outer security domain and the aim is to ensure the identity mapping and make it convenient. Its inner structure is no difference than the ordinary users besides the name of the node is \215common\216, which means it is shared by many security domains. And the \215common\216 user is a must sub node of every people node Now, let us talk about the user information model. As is shown in Table.2 blow, we will not provide the exact attribute of user due to it should comply with the specific appliance The \215special resource\216 field record which systems originally refusing is now open to the user and which systems should be open to the user do not serve the user at the moment. The meaning of the other majority fields is comprehensible; we will mainly talk about the field of \215pseudorandom identifiers

And for the \215common\216 user, the field of \215Is global\216 is 0 and the \215special resource\216 is a big list, while the other fields are blank To show the relationship of the resource, we employ several characters including \215_ 216, \215@\216,\216$\216 and so on. What about the situation of the character exist in the username or the resource name? In order to avoid mistake, we will employ escape character-\215\\\216, which is rarely used. So if the username is \215Jose@phy\216, then we should use \215Jose\\@phy\216 in the String To enable self-service of attribute modifying, only basic information and authentication information can be modified by the user him/herself. All other is managed by the administrator V.  C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we firstly propose unified identity management model and the identity life cycle management Then based on this, we give a federated identity management model and the detailed cross-domain access procedure, at the same time talk about account linking, identity mapping and identity provision. At last, we design the model\220s application that can be regarded as the example of model\220s application The contribution of this paper is as follows 1 Unified identity management model in different systems 2 Identity life cycle management both in one UIM and in federation 3 Pseudorandom identifi er enabled acco unt linking and identity mapping 4 Identity information directory tree structure design and LDAP user model information structure design However, further study is still needed: expanding the scope of unified identity management model; improving the security mechanism of the model and analyze the implementing details of the directory service.

key parameters for root cause analysis of anomalies This study emphasizes that the defined baseline can be used to characterize a new computer model This will allow us to characterize a new notebook computer regardless of the model and reduce the time for analysis In this study PPA and MD were independently used to identify the similarity of new observations to healthy data PPA performed this analysis in a reduced dimension based on an optimization criterion maximum variance It was also found that PPA can identify the faulty parameters based on the data whereas MD requires an understanding of the system The strength of PPA lies in the ability to decompose the signal and extract additional information not originally available used to identify faults in the system PPA overcomes masking effects when working with highly correlated data The strength of the MD method is that it preserves all the information available because it does not reduce the original dimensionality of the data The drawbacks of using just the MD method are that it cannot be used directly for fault identification and it is susceptible to masking effects With the MD results and our understanding of the system functionality four critical parameters were empirically identified the fan speed and the three temperature components CPU temperature motherboard temperature and videocard temperature In parallel in the PPA approach the principal component space also identified the fan speed as the most dominant and from the residual principal component space three temperature parameters were identified to be dominant mathematically confirming the earlier empirical conclusion The cross-validated result shows that these two algorithms can be used for fault detection and isolation The MD method can be used for quick fault detection at a system level and fault isolation can be made if related fault to MD signatures are available PPA can also be used when system faults are not known and where critical parameters need to be identified ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is sponsored by the members of the CALCE Prognostics and Health Management Consortium at the University of Maryland College Park REFERENCES 1 N Vichare P Rodgers V Eveloy and M Pecht Environment and Usage Monitoring of Electronic Products for Health Assessment and Product Design International Journal of Quality Technology and Quantitative Management 2\(4 235-250 2007 2 J Gu N Vichare T Tracy and M Pecht Prognostics Implementation Methods for Electronics 53rd Annual Reliability  Maintainability Symposium RAMS Florida 2007 3 G Zhang C Kwan R Xu N Vichare and M Pecht An Enhanced Prognostic Model for Intermittent Failures in Digital Electronics IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky MT March 2007 4 N Vichare and M Pecht Enabling Electronic Prognostics Using Thermal Data Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Thermal Investigation of ICs and Systems Nice Cote d'Azur France 27-29 September 2006 5 N Vichare P Rodgers and M Pecht Methods for Binning and Density Estimation of Load Parameters for Prognostics and Health Management International Journal of Performability Engineering Vol 2 No 2 April 2006 6 A Fraser N Hengartner K Vixie and B Wohlberg Incorporating Invariants in Mahalanobis Distance based Classifiers Application to Face Recognition in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN Portland OR USA Jul 2003 7 J Edward Jackson Govind S Mudholkar Control Procedures for Residuals Associated With Principal Component Analysis Technometrics Vol.21 No.3 1979 8 J Liu Khiang-Wee Lim R Srinivasan and X Doan On-Line Process Monitoring and Fault Isolation Using PCA Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation pp 658 661 2005 9 G Taguchi S Chowdhury and Y Wu The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System New York McGrawHill 2001 10 E B Martin A J Morris and J Zhang Process Performance Monitoring Using Multivariate Statistical Process CSontrol IEE Proc Control Theory Application Vol 143 No.2 March 1996 11 H Chen G Jiang C Ungureanu and K Yoshihira Failure Detection and Localization in Component Based Systems by Online Tracking KDD 2005 12 H Wang Z Song and P Li Fault Detection Behavior and Performance Analysis of Principal Component Analysis Based Process Monitoring Methods American Chemical Society Vol 41 pp 2455 2464 2002 13 H H Yue S.J Qin Reconstruction-Based Fault Identification Using a Combined Index American Chemical Society Vol 40 pp 4403-4414 2001 8

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
