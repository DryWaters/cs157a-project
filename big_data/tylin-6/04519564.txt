A Framework for Extrusion Detection Using Machine Learning   Yan Luo and Jeffrey J.P. Tsai Department of Computer Science, Uni versity of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 tsai@cs.uic.edu   Abstract  Machine learning deals with the issue of how to build programs that improve their performance at some task through experience. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. They are particularly useful for \(a\ poorly understood problem domains where little knowledge exists for the humans to develop effective algorithms; \(b\ domains where 
there are large databases containing valuable implicit regularities to be discovered; or \(c\ domains where programs must adapt to changing conditions. Not surprisingly, the field of cyber space turns out to be a fertile ground where many software security problems could  be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms  This paper deals with the subject of applying machine learning in extraction detection. In the paper  we present our research work on design and implementation of an extrusion detection system for information security of big companies. The result 
shows a potential in real-world applications  1. Introduction  Extrusion is the unauthorized transfer of digital assets that are essential to accomplishing a company's mission credit card numbers, customer records, source code, transactional information and other classified information - by trusted insides. Trusted insides can be any of the company’s employees, its suppliers and sometimes indirectly even its customers. An extrusion can be malicious, such as a theft of information, or unintentional, such as the accidental inclusion of an 
unauthorized recipient on a sensitive e-mail. Malicious or accidental, the consequences of leakages can be dire: regulatory fines, lost business, embarrassment, or lawsuits In this paper, we present our research work on design and implementation of an extrusion  detection system for information security using machine learning. Currently, the problem of information security in big companies has become more and more important. The leaking of confidential information and internal attacks cost a lot of money of these companies 
every year. Therefore an effective and efficient solution is urgently demanded. Extrusion detection system \(EDS\ is a good choice for solving this problem and protecting confidential information. However EDS is a new research topic and there is not much research effort focusing on this area. Extrusion detection is a reverse process of intrusion detection Intrusion detection system \(IDS\ is to protect the system from outside attacks, while EDS is to protect the system from inside attacks [1   Th er ef o r e th e r e ar e many similar characteristics between EDS and IDS 
Based on this fact, we studied IDS and compare it to EDS Currently there are two general categories of intrusion detection techniques, misuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection is also called signature-based detection. In misuse detection, wellknown attacks or weak spots of the system are encoded into signatures, which are then used to match evidence from run-time activities to identify intrusions Anomaly detection is also called statistical-based detection. In anomaly detection, normal behavior of user and system activities are first modeled into normal 
profiles, which are then used as baselines so that runtime activities that result in significant deviation are triggered as possible intrusions. These methods can be also applied to extrusion detection. However, misuse detection needs much human effort to find well-known attacks and encode them to a lot of signatures; anomaly detection also needs much human effort to select proper features for modeling normal profiles Therefore, we proposed another combination method which integrates both misuse detection and anomaly detection and uses data mining techniques for 
automatically generating detection rules and selecting proper features In this method, both user and system activities are first recorded as raw data, such as keyboard/mouse events, process events, file system events  network  connection events, and network traffic events. These

raw data will then be analyzed by data mining techniques, such as association rule analysis, frequency analysis, link analysis, sequence analysis, and classification analysis After these analyses, detection rules and proper features will be automatically generated. Then the detection rules can be used to detect existing extrusions and the proper features can be used to build normal profiles and detect future possible extrusions. Based on this idea, we proposed a framework of EDS for information security of big companies. The framework includes data collection, data analysis, and extrusion detection. At the current stage, we have implemented a prototype system for data collection, which includes four modules, user monitor, process monitor, file system monitor, and network monitor  We introduce the basic concepts of machine learning first then present system architecture and system components in Section 3. In section 4, we discuss the technical approach.  We present the implementation in section 5 and conclude the paper in section 6  2. Machine Learning  Machine learning is concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computer systems to autonomously acquire and integrate knowledge to continuously improve them to finish their tasks efficiently and effectively. There are three main learning paradigms according to the available information in the training examples. They are supervised learning, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning   In supervised learning, the desired output of each input in the training examples is given. The goal of learning is to find a function implied in the training examples that could be used to predict the output for any unseen valid input. The output of the function could be class label \(such task is called pattern recognition or classification\ or continuous real value such task is called regression or function approximation In reinforcement learning, the machine is usually not given training data, but interacts with its environment by producing a series of actions. Each of action will affect the state of environment. The environment in turn will generate reward or punishment. The aim of reinforcement learning is to discover a policy  for selecting actions to maximize the reward or minimize the punishment In unsupervised learning, the machine receives the inputs only without outputs or  rewards from its  environment. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the patterns in the inputs and build the representation of the input that can be used to make decision, predict future inputs and so on. Example of unsupervised learning is clustering and data compression  3. System Architecture  Based on the study of both IDS and EDS, we proposed a combination method which integrates both misuse detection and anomaly detection and applies data mining techniques for automatically generating detection rules and selecting proper features. In this method, both user and system activities are first recorded as raw data, such as keyboard/mouse events process events, file system events, network connection events, and network traffic events. These raw data will then be analyzed by data mining techniques, such as association rule analysis, frequency analysis, link analysis, sequence analysis, and classification analysis After these analyses, detection rules and proper features will be automatically generated. Then the detection rules can be used to detect existing extrusions and the proper features can be used to build normal profiles and detect future possible extrusions The framework can be divided into data collection,        data analysis, and extrusion detection as shown in  Figure 1. Next, we will describe the detail of each module A. Target system: Target system is the system that is being monitored and protected from extrusions. The target system can be a personal computer, a local network, or event a whole company's computer system   B. Data collection: Data collection is the main module for collecting the raw data which includes a lot of information or events, such as 1\ User behaviors: keyboard events, mouse events 2\ System behaviors: process events, file system events, clipboard events 3\ Network behaviors: connection events, network traffic events To capture these different types of events or information, the Data Collection module can be further divided into several sub-modules, User Monitor, Process Monitor, Network Monitor, File System Monitor, and Clipboard Monitor. All these sub-modules are running simultaneously to monitor different types of events and produce the raw data 
84 


C.  Raw data: Raw data is the initial event information that is produced by different sub-module monitors, as discussed above. Although the raw data contains many different types of information or events, the format should be standardized. Because the formatted raw data is easy to be stored and further processed for data analysis D. Data analysis: Data analysis is the module that analyzes the raw data to generate detection rules and select proper features. In this module, different data mining techniques will be applied, such as 1\ Association rule analysis: to mine the possible association rule 2\requency analysis: to analyze the frequency of different events and features 3\ Link analysis: to construct the possible link between different events 4\ Sequence analysis: to find the most frequent sequences and analyze their features 5\ Classification analysis. to classify the different type of events into categories E. Detection rules  Detection rules are automatically generated by data analysis module and can be used for future extrusion detections  F. Features: Proper features are automatically selected by data analysis module. The proper features are the most important features that could model the system and user's normal profiles. The normal profiles can be further used to detect abnormal events and the possible extrusions G Database SQL database is the storage place to store all the information and events which includes the raw data, the detection rules, the proper features and the system and user's normal profiles  H. Detection engine: Detection engine is the module that interactively loads the detection rules from SQL database and applies these detection rules on the target system for run-time extrusion. The detection engine can also load the system and user's normal profiles from SQL database and monitor the target system. If the system or the user's behavior  significantly deviate the  baseline of the normal profiles, the alarm of possible extrusions is triggered   4. Technical Approach  By analyzing these different events and their happening sequences, we can define rules to detect the intrusion or extrusion activities. For example BINDER [3 s imp ly d e te c t s  b r e a k i n e x t r u s io n s b y  determining the network connections are unrelated to user actions. BINDER also uses process information to limit the correlation. Only processes that receive user input are allowed to make connections  We can use event timestamp as index and sort all the recorded system events. Then we can analyze the intrusion or extrusion activities. Such as 1\ If an unknown process is created not by the user input, then it is probably an intrusion or extrusion process 2\ If an unknown network connection is requested not by the user input, then it is probably an intrusion or extrusion activity 3  If a confidential file is read and the content is transferred out of the computer, then it is probably an intrusion or extrusion activity  4\ If the content of a confidential file is copied to the clipboard and pasted to another file, then it is probably an intrusion or extrusion activity  Currently, we can monitor and record the following system events 1  User input events: keyboard click events, mouse click events 2  Process events: process create events, process terminate events  3\ Network connection events: request new connection events  4  Network traffic events: network traffic data events  5  File system events: file create events, file modify events, file open/close events, file read/write events  6\ Clipboard events: clipboard data events copy/paste events

4.1 Pattern of extrusions  By sorting all the recorded system events by their timestamps, we can obtain a large set of data. Based on these data, we believe we can apply some data mining techniques to analyze them and find some patterns of intrusion or extrusion activities. And also, we can predefine some patterns of intrusion or extrusion activities, and use the pattern recognition techniques to find the possible intrusion or extrusion activities in the large set of data Data mining and pattern recognition are useful for finding patterns or abnormal activities in the already recorded data. But they are hard to use for real-time monitoring the system and triggering alarm when the intrusion or extrusion activities happened. The best way is that the system is pre-trained with large datasets by using data mining techniques or the patterns of intrusion and extrusion activities are pre-defined by users. Then the pattern recognition techniques or rulebased detection techniques are used for real-time monitoring the system activities and the alarm will be triggered when some patterns are found or some rules are matched  4.2 Extrusion forecasting  For forecasting the next intrusion or extrusion activity, the definition of pattern or rule is very important. If we can obtain the accurate and enough patterns of intrusion and extrusion activities, then I think we can forecast the next intrusion or extrusion activity. Or if we can define the detection rules correctly and completely, then it is also easy to forecast the next intrusion or extrusion activity On the other hand, forecasting new types of intrusion or extrusion activities is another important but difficult problem. To deal with this problem, I think the possible solution is still to find some proper patterns or rules for detection. But since we try to forecast new \(unknown\ypes of intrusion or extrusion activities, the patterns or rules can not be defined completely. One way is to do the partial pattern recognition or rule matching. That is if the pattern is partially recognized or the rule is partially matched then we can trigger an alarm for possible extrusion or intrusion activities. The other way is to find abnormal activities in the system. To find abnormal activities we first need to model the normal activities. Then we monitor all the system activities and if some activities are not belong to normal activities, they could possibly be intrusion or extrusion activities. But how to model the normal activities is still a difficult problem   4.3 Dynamic mechanism  Although, we can monitor many system events and user behaviors, how to organize these events information and use them to detect extrusion or guard security is still a very difficult problem There are two main directions to organize and use these system events and user behaviors information On way is to define some rules and apply these rules to the recorded or the real-time events information. If the rule is matched, then the alarm will be triggered. The other way is to organize these events information as a large dataset or many datasets, and then apply the data mining and the pattern recognition techniques on these datasets to detect extrusion or security threads   Currently, we are focusing on the first way, rulebased extrusion detection and information security. A dynamic mechanism for adding rules, testing rules and deleting rules can be done too. That means, we do not hard code the rules into our system, but develop a system that can be easily added rules and delete rules So that, when we do the experiments, we can simply add the specific rules to the system and run the experiments. If the result is not very good, we can delete the previous rules and add more new rules. Then we can run another experiments based on new rules. In this way, we can efficiently run many experiments for extrusion detection and information security  For developing such a system, the most important problem is to define the templates of rules. To accomplish this object, we can first categorize some rules and find the similar rules. Based on these different types of similar rules, we can propose some basic templates for different rules  For example, a possible template can be a sequence of actions 1  Sequence: Action_1 Action_2 Action_3   Action_N That means the user can specify a sequence of actions as a detection rule. Then the system will examine the recorded system events information to find whether there is a sequence of events that match the detection rule. As an example, based 
86 


on the above template, the following is a simple detection rule 2  A confidential file is opened the content is copied to clipboard the content is pasted to another file the other file is saved So in this detection rule, there are four actions and there a specific order that these actions are performed. Then if our detection system found a sequence of events that match this rule, then some alarm will be triggered and some reactions will be done For another example, the frequency of some actions can also be a template 3  Frequency: Action 1 repeats N times Then based on this template, we can add a possible detection rule like this 4  A connection to the same IP is made more than 10 times After adding this rule, the system will monitor the network connection events and detect whether there is an IP that has been connected more than 10 times. If yes, the extrusion activities maybe happened and some more investigation and reactions will be performed The above is just some very basic idea. There are still many problems should be considered, such as the timing problem. Sometimes the extrusion activities will not follow our detection rule step by step. The order of there activities may be interleaving. So our detection rules should concern the timing information For examples, for frequency rules, we can set some timing threshold which means if a specific action repeats more than N time within a timing period, then it will trigger the alarm After we have some templates for adding detection rules, we can modify and refine these templates for future defining new rules. After we finish proposing these templates, we can develop such a system which contains these templates and can use these templates to add new rules or delete old rules   5. Implementation  At the current stage, we have implemented a prototype system for data collection, which includes four modules, user monitor, process monitor, file system monitor, and network monitor. To protect the confidential information and prevent leaking out the confidential information, we can use some programs to monitor the events on the computer and network Based on some predefined keywords and detection rules, our monitoring system can set alarm when the confidential information is insecure or leaking out. In our prototype system, there are several different modules to monitor the events on the computer and network 1  User monitor to monitor the user's behavior on the computer, such as keyboard events \(which key down\, mouse events \(click, coordinates\, on which application, and so on 2  Process monito r: to monitor all the processes on the computer and all the process events including creating processes, suspending processes, terminating processes, and so on 3  Network monitor to monitor network connections, especially the abnormal connections, including process id, protocol remote address, remote port, status, and so on 4  Traffic monitor to monitor traffic packets on the network, including protocol, remote address remote port, data packet which can be used to filter confidential key words 5  File monitor to monitor the file system including the files that contain the confidential information, such as creating, opening, copying renaming, reading, writing files 6  Clipboard monitor to monitor the system clipboard events and the change of contents of the system clipboard  6. Conclusion  As a conclusion, our research work focuses on design and implementation of an extrusion detection system for information security of big companies. We first studied both IDS and EDS. By comparing them each other, there are many similar characteristics between them. Currently there are two general categories of intrusion detection techniques, misuse detection and anomaly detection. These methods can be also applied to extrusion detection problems. These two main methods have advantages as well as  
87 


     Figure 1. System Diagram          disadvantages, such as both of them need much human effort. Therefore, we proposed another combination method which integrates both misuse detection and anomaly detection and applies machine learning for automatically generating detection rules and selecting proper features. In this method, both user and system activities are first recorded as raw data. Then the raw data is processed and analyzed by different machine learning techniques. Finally, detection rules and proper features will be automatically generated. And the extrusion detection and confidential information protection can be carried out based on the detection rules and proper features. Currently, we have implemented a prototype system for data collection which includes four modules, user monitor, process monitor, file system monitor, and network monitor. In the future work, we plan to extend the system to deal with the raw data and to automatically generate detection rules, select proper features, and construct normal profiles   7.

   7  The simulation was run using four different sensor configurations to characteri ze the benefit of using each sensor. These configurations, as well as their characteristics are shown in Table 2. In each case, a single sensor was chosen to provide the velocity feedback and another sensor was chosen to provide the position feedback. In order to better characterize the effects of a given sensor over another, sensor measuremen ts are not combined. For example, if the camera is used for position feedback and the IMU is used for velocity feedback, the IMU velocity measurements are not integrat ed to incorporate into the position estimate from the camera. For each configuration the step response is shown in Figure 9 and impulse disturbance response of falling off of a 10cm rock step is shown in Figure 10  The step and impulse responses of the system clearly show that the system performs much worse with noisy measurements and is especially sensitive to noisy velocity measurements. When the IMU is used, the system responds and settles very quickly compared to when velocity is estimated by discretely differentiating noisy position signals. This occurs because a small error in a position signal will be amplified in the velocity estimation. However whether or not the IMU is used, the system stays within the pointing requirements of 4.0 degrees when falling off of a 10cm rock  The system is also sensitive to sampling rate as evidenced by the fact that the system reacts better when using the integrated IMU signal for position instead of the direct measurement from the camera. The IMU is sampling almost 30 times faster than the camera and so the system is able to respond more quickly. However, the IMU will drift at a rate of 4.2 degrees per hour, so, if only the IMU is used for position estimation, the antenna will need to be recalibrated at least every 55 minutes  Combined Experiment  Earth tracking for the combin ed experiment was conducted using a web cam and a 2D circular "Earth" on a black background.  This is shown in Figure 11.  The camera field of view for this experiment was 30 degrees.  This experiment was designed to test general tracking accuracy and the tracking response to large movements.  In this situation, the Earth remained stationary on the background much as it would during a short period on the moon.  The camera was moved in such a way to simulate the movement of a rover moving over rocky terrain.  This motion consisted of small high frequency movements and drift with intermittent large impulses \(such as those generated by going over a rock The resulting output of this tracking was used to calculate the error in circle tracking. By looking at the output \(which included center location and radius\, we found that the variance in tracked circle vs. the diameter of the Earth \(in pixels\ was on average 8 pixels.  For a field of view of 30 degrees, this comes out to be .234 degrees of error    Figure 12: The position error from the live experiment using either the IMU for the velocity estimate or the encoders  


   8  Figure 11. View of the 2D Earth on a dark background, the tracking circle shown in black  The output was also fed back into the controller simulation to determine how the physical system would respond to real data from the camera. The resulting controller error is shown in Figure 12 with two different simulated velocity sources: the IMU and the encoders.  As expected, direct measurement of the velocity from the IMU provides up to 50% better system response compared to discretely differentiating the encoders  7. C ONCLUSIONS   This paper demonstrates a design for an S-band antenna tracking system that is able to achieve the pointing accuracy necessary for a 2 Mbps data transfer rate from the Moon to Earth while roving. Different se nsor configurations for the system were compared includ ing a fast-sampling gyro, an Earth tracking camera and on-axis encoders. The analysis shows that the system is most sensitive to sampling rate and discretization noise in velocity measurement. Therefore, the system is significantly improved with the addition of a fast sampling angular rate sensor. Furthermore, a simple Earth tracking camera using a Hough transform performs very robustly in the structured environment until the Earth surpasses 85% and would thus be an pose sensor until late in the mission   8. R ECOMMENDATIONS FOR F UTURE W ORK   The next step after the simulation is implementing the controller on the physical hardware and comparing response against the simulation. This would give real life results that would include static friction and backlash. Although the simulation included limits for the motors that simulate real life there are always unexpecte d inefficiencies that would show up on physical hardware. An extension of this paper would be to develop a similar system to stabilize the camera. The technologies in this paper could be used as camera image stabilization to create smoother better looking video while driving across the lunar surface. In order to explore the robustness of the system better characterization of earth tracking in non-ideal cases is needed. We did not do much error analysis dealing with any kind of lens flairs, sun spots or lunar terrain visible in the frame   9.

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
