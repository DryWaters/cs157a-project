Tianjin Key Lab for Advanced Signal Processing, Civil Aviation Univ of China. Tianjin 300300, China Abstract Automatic target recognition technique, based on the projections in the samples range space, can be availably used in SAR target recognition It requires that the relativity between the range spaces of different targets should be minimal. However, the relativity between the corresponding range spaces is very big if the different targets have similar appearance and structure, which 
will considerably reduce the recognition performance. So, it is essential to construct new projection spaces from the range spaces of similar targets, so as to enlarge projection difference. In this paper, an efficient method for constructing the optimal projection space is proposed. The proposed method can effectively enlarge the difference between similar targets by the projections in the optimal projection space. Experimental results show that the optimal projection space can greatly increase th e separability between different similar targets and is superior to other classical methods in both reco gnition performance and efficiency Keywords Automatic Target Recognition; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Projection Space 1. Introduction For its all-weather, all-time working capability and high 
resolution, synthetic aperture radar \(SAR\has been widely used in military reconnaissan ce, as well as civilian remote sensing of the Earth and many other areas of exploration SAR-based automatic targ et recognition \(ATR important technology to improve the utilization of SAR image Its particular application in battlefield sensing has become a hot research  SAR-based ATR technology is mainly divided into template matching method s and model reconstruction methods  4   5   I n tem p late m a tching m e thods standa rd templates are formed based on the training samples, and used to classify the test ones.

However, if the relation ship of the range subspaces is large, the perfo rmance of recognition will be poor In this paper, an effective method of projection space construction  is  proposed  for the  classification  of  different targets with similar range spaces. With the reasonable constructed projection space, the distinction between different targets is increased, which is h elpful to the classification and recognition. The experimental results show that this method has good performance on the recognition with small number 
of training samples and mu lti-type of similar targets 2. Problem Formulation Considering K types of SAR targets, the number of training samples of k th target is k N 1,2 kK  Each SAR image of the k th target is expanded to column vector 1,2 i kk iN  s and matrix 12   k N 
kkk k  Sss s  is formed Usually, the pixel number M of SAR images is much larger than the number k N of SAR training images. So, the rank of k S meets  kk rank N M  S   The eigenvalue decomposition is done to the covariance matrix of k S and the k th target’ s range space  k 
S is constructed with non-zero ei genvalue eigenvect  If there is little or no relativity between different targets’ range space, the samples projection in the range space can be directly used as their features for the classification and recognition However, there is often strong similarity in the appearance and structure of the targets. Their range spaces are not orthogonal, even have stro ng relativity. So, th e difference of different target’s projection in range space is weaken which will make it difficult for target recognition. Therefore it is necessary to transform the range spaces of similar targets to new projection spaces, so as to enlarge projection difference The optimal projection space  opt k P of the 
k th target should meet 1\ost similar with k th range space 2\rictly orthogonal with other range space This paper is to construct the optimal projection space  opt k P from strong correlative range spaces of different targets With projection in  opt k P the projection-value of k th target will be maximized, while other targets be minimized _______________ ______________ 978-1-4244-2732-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 


3. Projection Space Construction Define  k G as the range space of all the targets except for the k th one, thus 12 1 1          kkkK   GSS SS S  1 According to the conditions to be met for the optimal projection spaces, th e solution of  opt k P can be expressed as follow     min   k HH kk kk F st  P SP I GP O 2 where F  stands for the Frobenius no rm of a matrix, and the column of the matrix is p N p k N N   I is a matrix with dimension kp N N  with the main diagonal elements being ones and others zeros Considering the whole range space  S of all the targets 12      K  SSS S  3 The rank of space  S still meets  rank N M  S  where 1 K N NN   the column number of matrix  S Obviously  S is a subspace of Euclid space  M R  According to equation \(1  k G is a subspace of  S  Let   kk   PG S  subspace  k P is orthogonal with  k G and   kk  PG S  4 According to matrix theory  k P is composed by the eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix 11           H HHH kkk k   SS S S G G G G 5 However, because  S is a subspace of Euclid space  M R  the computing complexity of direct eigen-decomposition method is about 4  OM which will fairly lower the processing efficiency. So, in this paper, a fast algorithm based on orthogonal complement space is proposed According to equation \(4  S and    kk GP stand for a same space, so there must be a unitary matrix N s  QR meeting    kk  SQ G P 6 Let 12  s  QQQ in which 1 Q and 2 Q are orthogonal complement space to each other, meeting 1  k  GSQ 7 2   k  PSQ 8 According to equation \(7 1 1     HH k   QSSSG 9 For 1 Q and 2 Q are orthogonal complement space to each other, thus 22 11 H H  QQ I QQ 10 Therefore 2 Q is composed of the eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues of 11 H  IQQ So incorporating 2 Q into equation \(8\can get  k P  Assume p Q is a unitary matrix and 1  kkp  PPQ thus 11      H HH kk kp kp kk  PP PQ PQ PP 11 So 1  k P and  k P stands for a sam o nsidering 1    HH kk k k p  GP G PQ O 12 1  k P also meets constraints of equa tion \(2\So, th e matrix form of  k G s orthogonal subspace is not unique.

Experimental Results In this paper, the SAR image database of U.S. MSTAR plan is employed. Three main types of the targets, BMP, BTR T72 with full-orientation SAR image data, are selected for the research. The data collected on the perspective 17  and 15  are respectively used as training samples and test ones. All the images are in 128 128  pixel size First, with MSTAR data, we study on the separability of projection data, which is gene rated by the proposed method In the range of 60  window, the range space  B MP S   B TR S  72  T S are calculated, and the optimal projection space  opt B MP P   opt B TR P  72  opt T P are constructed. The trai ning and testing samples of BMP and BTR are separately projected to  B MP S The results are shown in Fig 2. Where, horizontal axis stands for the eigenvectors of projection space, sorted by corresponding eigenvalues; vertical axis stands for samples’ projection length on each eigenvector of projection space Comparing each sub-figure in Fig 2, we can find that the projection of BMP and BTR are difficult to distinguish Correspondingly, the same data are projected to  opt B MP P shown 


in Fig 3. We can find that there is prodigious difference between the projection of BMP and BTR. Therefore, the projection space constructed in this paper can greatly enlarge the distinction of different targets  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection a\                                                               \(b\amples    10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection c\ Training Samples                                                                 \(d\ Test Samples Fig 2 Projection of BMP and BTR Samples in BMP’s Range Space  B MP S 10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection a\P Training Samples                                                               \(b 10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection  10 20 30 40 0 0.5 1 Projection c\ BTR Training Samples                                                               \(d Testing Samples Fig 3 Projection of BMP and BTR Samples in BMP’s Optimal Projection Space  opt B MP P Then, we study the influence of different-size orientation window on the recognition performance. For each orientation division with width 30   60   90   180  and 360  the optimal projection space is constructed with training samples in current window. Projection matrix  L k P  1  kK  is composed with the first 5 L vector of the optimal projection space  k P Thus, the simplest classifier is defined: sample l x is classified to the type of the pr ojection matrix in which it has the largest projection norm The projection norm of sample l x in matrix  L k P is defined as   1,2 HL lk l k px k K  P 16 Based on the above method, the recognition rate of the three main types is shown in Fig 4. We can find that, this method has good recognition performance for all the three targets, especially for BTR and T72 being better than 95 Further, the recognition pe rformance of the proposed method is compared with other outstanding algorithms. With the same experimental conditions, the recognition performance of four methods in different orientation window is plotted in Fig 5. We can find that, this method is superior to 


other recognition methods in the overall performance Although it has a slight decrease for the window width 360   it’s still equal to KPCA+SVM method  30 60 90 180 360 80 85 90 95 100            Recognition Rate BMP   BTR   T72   Average Fig 4 Recognition Performance in Different Window Width 30 60 90 180 360 80 85 90 95 100               Recognition Rate SVM   PCA+SVM   KPCA+SVM   Proposed Fig 5 Performance Comparison of Different Recognition Methods Finally, this method is comp ared with other algorithms on the training and recognition efficiency, which is defined as the processed sample number per second. The efficiency comparison between the above four methods is shown in Fig 6. We can find that, the proposed method is 20% more than the best SVM method in trai ning efficiency, and 50% in recognition efficiency. Therefore the proposed method is far superior to other recognition methods in processing efficiency  Fig 6 Efficiency Comparison of Different Recognition Methods 5. Conclusions In this paper, a SAR-based ATR method of projection space construction is proposed. Keeping the strict orthogonal with other types of space, the con structed optimal projection space can get the largest approaching with target space. The space similarity between different targets is greatly eliminated Therefore, this method is more applicable to recognize the targets with similar pattern and structure. The experimental results show that this method is superior to other recognition methods in both recognition performance and processing efficiency 6 Acknowledgements This work is su pported in part by National Natural Science Foundations of China under grant 607 36009 and 60872110 References  Duan Rong , Chen Ling , M a n Hong . “Adaptive SAR ATR in  likelihood space”.

  5 case #5 Increase of channel rate for log-on If the channel rate for a log-on procedure is increased, there is a possibility that the log-on rush phenomenon can be mitigated even with a smaller number of channels Presently, only 600 bps in channel rate is used for a log-on procedure.  But, since a channel rate of 10500 bps is used to transmit user data in the present operation, it is conceivable that 10500 bps could be used for a log-on procedure, too We evaluated the log-on performance for the channel rate of 10500bps for this purpose Figure 6 \(a\he results for the case of using 10500 bps for the channel rate of P smc R smc P d and R d channels There are one each of P smc R smc P d and R d channels.  The log-on rush phenomenon is not observed until about 250 AES complete a log-on.  But after that, the effect of the phenomenon is observed.  Maximum time required for a log-on of 500 AES was over 3700 s Figure 6 \(b\2 R d channels.  The number of other channels is the same as in Fig.6 \(a Since the R d channel was overloaded in the previous configuration, the number of R d channels was doubled.  It was observed that the effect of log-on rush phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the load of R d channels Maximum time required for a log-on completion was about 700 s.  If the channel rate is increased, the log-on rush phenomenon can be prevented with a smaller number of channels, and the time required for a log-on procedure can also be decreased Increase of Number of Channel We added one 600 bps R smc channel to the former setting of three 600 bps R smc channels \(case #None\gure 7 shows the time required for a log-on of a particular number of AES in the case of 4 R smc channels.  The number of R d channel is unchanged.  The figure shows that it is effective to mitigate the phenomenon.  All AES completed a log-on in about 1500 s.  This result is almost the same as that in Fig.5 \(b 5  D ISCUSSION  Collision of Log-on Request In this section, we analyze the effect of collisions between log-on requests on the log-on rush phenomenon.

  6 shows an example of the number of log-on requests collisions during the period wh en 500 AES tried to log on for case #None in Table 2.  This figure shows the result for 20 trials.  The log-on sequences are repeated until all AES conplete a log on.  The number of log-on request collisions are 100 or more when the sequence started.  Then, it decreased rapidly to the range between 10 and 30 and continued until 3500 s.  The l og-on requests continued to conflict with each other, but the number of AES decreased over time as the number of AES that had completed log-ons increased.  Then, after the last AES completed a log on collision of log-on requests di ed out at about 5000 s as shown in Fig.8 Figure 9 shows an example of log-on requests collision numbers for the cases described in the previous section c\show the case of asymmetric use of R smc  e channel rate.  Figure 9\(f\case of increased R smc  channels.  The number of collisions decreased more rapidly and died out earlier for all cases in Fig.9 than that of the symmetric case shown in Fig.8.  For example, the collisions died out in about 1000 s for case #5 \(Fig.9\(c\s value is much smaller than the value of about 5000 s in Fig.8 This means that the log-on rush phenomenon is mainly caused by the large number of collisions and their long continuation               a\ase #1     d d channel               b\ase #3     e d channels               c     f smc channels  Fig.9 An example of log-on re quest collision number with Time for three mitigation methods 


  7 Figure 9 \(d\ows that the number of collisions decreased rapidly until about 1000 s, but th en it subsequently leveled off and continued until about 3000 s.  This means that the congestion of R smc channel decreased rapidly for first 1000 s but then another cause delayed the completion of log-on Figure 9 \(e\R d channels are doubled.  As shown, it was observed that the number of collisions decreased rapidly, a nd died out by about 700 s This shows that the congestion of R d channel caused the number of collisions to level off in Fig.9 \(d Figure 9 \(f\ber of collisions decreased rapidly, and died out by about 1300 s.

But the traffic on R d channel increased rapidly, and it became overloaded.  This caused the continuation of many collisions on R d channel \(Fig.10 \(a\he log-on rush phenomenon.  Figure 10 \(b\hat the congestion on R d channel is prevented by increasing the number of R d  channels and that the log-on rush phenomenon is prevented It should be noted that even if R smc channel has good transmission ability, the log-on rush occurs depending on the ability of R d channel to deal with a large number of logons in a short period of time Throughput and Traffic on R smc Channels Figure 11 shows the relationship between traffic and throughput on R smc channel for the case of symmetric use of channels \(Fig.3 indicates the result of each R smc  channel for each of 20 trials.  60 points are plotted in the figure, because there are 3 R smc channels and 20 trials Traffic is defined by the ratio of the sum of transmitted data length in time and the transmission period.  Throughput is defined by the ratio of the su m of received data length in time and the transmission period.  The curve shows the theoretical curve for slotted ALOHA channels calculated from the following equation  where S is throughput and G traffic It can be seen that all th ree channels were extremely overloaded to a similar extent \(500-550 % traffic\thus throughput of all channels was very low \(about 5 %\he congestion on the channels continued for a long time.  This caused many AES to complete a log-on only after a very long time Figure 12 shows the relationship between traffic and throughput on R smc channels for the cases of asymmetric use of R smc channels, increased channel rate and increased number of R smc c\he case of asymmetric use of R smc e show the case of increased channel rate.

Throughput of those channels is 25-30 %, about 10 % and about 5 respectively.

This result shows that the congestion on each channel decreased by increasing the number of R smc channels and this mitigated the log-on rush phenomenon considerably as shown in Fig.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Method Asymmetric Use of R smc Channel 227One of the advantages is that it is effective for a channel rate of 600 bps without increasing the number of channels.  Another is that it can be realized just by modifying the GES software without modifying any avionics software.  Since the modification of avionics software involves much difficulty, we consider this method to be the best alternative at present Increase of Channel Rate 227One of the advantages is that the number of required channels can be decreased.  Another is that the period required for a log-on can be the shortest compared to the other two methods.  The disadvantage is that some modification of GES and avionics software is required.  This method should be considered for realization in the future Increase of Number of Channel 227One of the advantages is that it is effective for a channel rate of 600 bps.  Another is that it can be realized very easily by increasing the number of channels.  The disadvantage is that, since frequency allocation is limited in general, it may not be possible to increase the number of channels 6  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we descri bed the log-on rush phenomenon which may occur in the event of a GES or satellite failure in aeronautical satellite communi cation and possible methods to mitigate the phenomenon.  We showed as an example that it takes more than 5000 s for all 500 AES to complete a log-on for a typical channel configuration Then, we considered three methods of mitigation and analyzed the effectiveness of these by a series of simulations.  The first method was the asymmetric use of R smc channels.  We showed that the phenomenon can be almost completely prevented by choosing an adequate channel configuration without changing the channel rate and without increasing the number of R smc channels.  The second was the increase of channel rate of R smc channels We showed that the phenomenon can be prevented by this method using a smaller number of channels and that the time required for all AES to complete a log on can be reduced compared to the previous method.  The third was the increase in the number of R smc channels.  This is a straightforward method.  We showed that it is also effective to mitigate the phenomenon without increasing the channel rate.  But, the number of channels may not be increased freely, because frequency resources are limited We consider that the asymmetric use of R smc channel is the best alternative to mitigate the log-on rush phenomenon at present. The increase of channel rate will be a prospective measure to be realized in the fu ture.  It is also conceivable that these two measures could be combined to improve logon performance further The time for hundreds of AES to complete a log-on is still more than 1000 s even with the asymmetric use of R smc  channel.  This value is still very large and should be reduced.  Since only one P smc channel can be used per GES according to the AMSS SARPs, throughput of P smc channel is limited and this causes a very long time for log-on completion.  The reduction of the time is a problem that should be solved next A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank everyone concerned at INMARSAT Corporation, Japan Civil Aviation Bureau and Japan Radio Air Navigation Systems Association for their cooperation R EFERENCES    Al an Schust e r B ruce, Per Nokeby 223Log-on Issues\224, FANS Satcom Improvement Team 2 nd meeting in Paris, Oct 2007 2 n au tical Mo b ile Satellite Serv ices Stan d ard s and Recommended Practices   INM A RSAT: INM A RSAT AERONAUTICAL SYSTEM DEFINITION MANUAL\224, 2000  Y.Sum i y a A.Ishi de  223A St udy of Log-on R u sh usi ng Aeronautical Satellite Communication Simulator\224, The 2007 IEICE General Conference, Mar. 2007 \(Japanese only B IOGRAPHY  Yasuto Sumiya was born in Sapporo Japan.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
