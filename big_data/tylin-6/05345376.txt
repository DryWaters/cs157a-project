Effective Buffer and Storage Management in DTN Nodes  Stylianos Dimitriou, and Vassilis Tsaoussidis Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering Democritus University of Thrace Xanthi, Greece sdimitr, vtsaousi}@ee.duth.gr  Abstract Current wired networks have been developed on the basis of the AIMD principle, which offers increased performance and fairness. Nevertheless, there is a vast spectrum of networks from deep space to wireless sensor networks, where TCP fails to operate, as it results in frequent timeouts and intermittent or no connectivity at all. The DTN \(Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking\ architecture and particularly the Bundle protocol 
offers solutions in networks where low connectivity, big or variable delays and increased error rates are prevalent. Using persistent storage, a DTN node is able to overcome such limitations; the data can be transmitted several times until it is successfully received by the next hop. However, since the conditions in a DTN network might vary, from time to time we may experience high connectivity and low delays. In such cases data does not need to be transferred to persistent storage, as it will be probably be transmitted shortly and this transfer from buffer to persistent storage and back to buffer, will delay the transmission. In this paper we propose a system which 
implements a mechanism that aims to minimize packet transfers between buffers and persistent storage and hence accelerate transmissions Keywords-component; DTN; Bundle Protocol; Buffer Management I   I NTRODUCTION  The Bundle protocol  a i m s t o  r e s o l v e i ssue s i n  D T N  networks, such as intermittent connectivity, long or variable delays and high error rates. Examples of DTN networks are MANET, vehicular networks and deep-space networks. In most of these cases, there is not a continuous end-to-end path between the sender and the receiver; the receiver might be 
available after the sender has been disconnected or an intermediate routing node may be moving constantly between the always connected, albeit remote communicating ends Using persistent storage, the Bundle protocol manages to resolve most of these issues. Instead of storing packets in a temporary buffer, a DTN node stores packets permanently in a local storage unit. Data will be transmitted when the next hop is available and may be retransmitted several times, if the transmission fails. Persistent storage, however, has a significant drawback: it increases the communication overhead as it adds a processing delay which results by moving the data from buffer 
to persistent storage and back to buffer. Although most of the times this delay is negligible, there are cases where two nodes may be engaged in continuous low-delay transmissions. In such cases, persistent storage increases unnecessarily the connection time In this work, we investigate the potential of maintaining data-to-transmit in buffers, instead of moving them to persistent storage. We model a system where packets arrive from different flows. Based on the frequency of connections to the next hop, we do not store all packets in persistent storage but we maintain some of them in buffers. In this way, we aim to decrease service time and processing delay and hence 
increase performance. Since our proposal consists of work-inprogress, we do not include any evaluation to prove our claims The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief background on DTN architecture and protocols In section 3 we present the proposed model and the buffer management algorithm and in section 4 we set the framework for future work II  B ACKGROUND  The structure and protocols of Internet have been evolved around some characteristics that are ubiquitous in wired networks: available end-to-end path, small delays and low error-rates. The need to propose different protocols, in order to 
implement Delay Tolerant Networking [1 w a s app a r e nt  fro m  the beginning, since classical network protocols performed poorly in DTN networks. In order to be able to interconnect multiple regional DTN networks with themselves, as well with the Internet, an overlay layer was proposed, namely the Bundle layer, where the Bundle protocol is implemented. Contrary to TCP/IP networks where, in case of an unavailable link, the packets are discarded, the Bundle protocol specifies that traffic should be transferred in a Store-and-Forward fashion; packets arriving at the node should be saved in a storage unit, until the next hop becomes available. In order to ensure the integrity of 
data, a Custody Transfer mechanism may be used. A node that accepts data transferred with custody transfer should preserve the data until transmitted to the next hop and not drop them even in case of a full storage unit. Several modes exist concerning the bundle transmissions, involving acknowledgments and notification. Nevertheless, there are cases where we seek to decrease the complexity of the system in order to decrease the latency 9781-4244-3941-6/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 


III  S YSTEM M ODEL  We will present a basic model which we will use to apply our algorithm. Since our work is still in-progress, we will try to be as abstract as possible. Further details, as well as parameter values will be determined in the future A  Modeling Arrivals and Departures We consider a node which acts an intermediate to several flows. That is, packets of several senders enter the node at various instances. The flows can be identified either by the IP addresses of the sender and receiver, if IP is used, or by the endpoint ID. Since we assume network mobility, the node may accept packets either from other routing nodes or directly from senders. In the first case, the packets arrive back-to-back with constant interarrival times, and in the second case, in a stochastic manner. The node then has to keep them until a connection opportunity occurs, or until its storage space is full Each node has a buffer and a persistent storage unit, both limited. The buffer consists of two queues; a low-delay traffic LDT\queue and a high-delay traffic \(HDT\ queue. Fig. 1 shows the proposed model. Note that at this point we do not determine the sizes of the two queues. Their sizes can be either defined at the beginning, or vary as the correlation of traffic changes. Custody transfers are also stored in persistent storage   Figure 1  Proposed Model The aggregate incoming rate is noted as When a packet is accepted by the node, the node will decide if it belongs to a low-delay flow or to a high-delay flow \(we will describe shortly how low- and high-delay flows are defined\. If the packet belongs to a low-delay flow, it will be buffered in the LDT buffer, where it will remain until routed or until the buffer is full. In case the LDT buffer is full, older traffic will be moved to persistent storage. If the packet belongs to a highdelay flow, it will be moved immediately to persistent storage unless there is a communication opportunity. In this case it will be moved to the HDT buffer. Packets that exist in persistent storage are allowed to move to the HDT buffer, only when the next hop for the corresponding flow becomes available. The total service rate results by multiplexing the output of the two queues with a Weighted Fair Queuing [2  m u ltip lex e r   De ta ils  of the WFQ mechanism are still an open issue Summarizing, moving packets from buffer to storage and back, is allowed only in the following three cases 1  From LDT buffer to persistent storage. Packets that can move in this direction are either new packets that belong to a high-delay flow, or old packets that belong to a low-delay flow and the LDT buffer is full 2  From persistent storage to HDT buffer. Packets that can move in this direction are packets that were previously in persistent storage and currently they have a communication opportunity 3  From LDT buffer to HDT buffer upon packets arrival Packets belonging to a high-delay flow, will move to HDT buffer if there is currently a communication opportunity with a next hop  There is, however, a very rare case where packets would need to move from HDT buffer to persistent storage. This would happen when there is a communication opportunity which lasts less time than the time required to move the packets from persistent storage to HDT buffer and commence transmission. Packets which were transferred to HDT buffer would have nowhere to go and should be moved back to storage. Nevertheless, this is a special case that is unlikely to happen, given the high processing capabilities of current computers B  Distinguishing Low- and High-Delay Traffic In order to detect LDT, that is, traffic that we expect to have a smaller delay and generally faster forwarding, we record the time a packet enters the node t in and the time it leaves it  t out The difference of these two times diff sample equals with the storage delay of the packet, i.e. the time period where the packet remains in the node, either in buffer or persistent storage. For each flow i we calculate the weighted moving average of the storage delays diff i The average value of all flows’ storage delays gives the average storage delay of the system Diff lows that have less average storage delay than the total average, are characterized as low-delay flows, whereas the rest are characterized as high-delay flows. Assuming N flows passing through the node, we have in out sample t t diff   1 sample i i diff diff diff     1  0 9  0 \(2 N diff Diff N i i   1 3 Applying Eq. 1 to every packet and Eq. 2 to every flow, we result with the average Diff value \(Eq. 3 IV  F UTURE W ORK  In this paper we described a buffer management scheme which can be used to achieve less processing delays in a DTN network. Our work is in-progress and thus, has several open issues. Our future steps include 1  Determine the sizes of LDT and HDT queues. Should they be statically defined, or it is preferable to obtain values depending on the network load 2  Review the WFQ scheme used to multiplex the outputs of the two queues. This will also define the bandwidth 


that each type of traffic will possess. Failure to do so and we will end up in underutilization 3  Evaluate the proposed algorithm, both theoretically and experimentally. The results will be used to further calibrate the model, where necessary   R EFERENCES  1  V. Cerf, et al., “Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture,” IETF RFC 4838 April 2007 2  A. Demers, S.

further supported this idea and highlighted its simplicity Another plus point supporting this idea was the ECU's inherent ability to automatically transition to a new key which could be leveraged to drive the algorithm transition automatically The second major issue also identified in the distribution use case was reduction of ADF transition risk The goal of reducing this risk was achieved by completing all the preceding steps possible within the distribution use case which also would have a direct benefit to the warfighter The only remaining step was the transition itself By performing the installation of the ADF in the distribution use case it would be easy for an ECU to change a pointer within its memory to the new ADF to make the transition Therefore the ECU would be capable of transitioning without degrading the performance of the system and directly affecting the warfighter This capability alone makes it feasible for the system to update ADFs to protect warfighters in the future without interrupting critical communications ADF transition risk issues were initially identified in Ensuring The Security Of Warfighters Satcom Via Programmable Cryptographic Devices which discussed the costs versus the benefits of reduced transmission time By minimizing the steps in the transition the use case minimizes the time for transition In support of reducing ADF transition risk in the use case the ECU will report back to the MOS if the associated ADF for the new key does not exist This is a precautionary measure to ensure that every ECU that is being prepared to transition is capable of doing so The third major issue concerned the need for an ADF rollback use case which was developed to handle a rollback to the previous ADF if a problem arose from the use of the new ADF After a thorough review it was determined that the transition use case supported the necessary steps to achieve rollback given the key's association to an ADF The final piece needed to support rollback was a requirement to mandate the ECUs to hold the previous ADF for a defined period before purging their memory Requiring a system to store the last known good state is a best practice used within most systems to allow a system to revert to that known good state in the event of transition failure The required time period that the ADF should be held in memory would be determined by the system To leverage the transition use case to support rollback an immediate key change would need to occur The emergency re-key function found within most ECUs and supported by their systems enables the immediate transition to a new key by superseding the existing key Because more than one method i.e in-band or S-band,5 often can be used to communicate with the satellite one of the communication pathways could be utilized to send the new keys A related concern is that the terminal ECUs would not be able to receive the emergency re-key if the mission data link is lost which may require user intervention to re-key the ECUs The ECUs may need to be capable of automatically reverting to the previous ADF if the connection is lost for a predetermined period This is an area in which more work needs to be done One consideration in conjunction with the period of time that the ECU has to hold the previous ADF is the number of ADFs the system would be required to transition within that period To limit the burden on a space ECU it may be necessary to allow only one ADF transition to occur during that period thus reducing the potential SWAP impact to the payload The more ADFs that are reprogrammed within the holding period the more memory required within the ECU Use Case Summary Since the durations of three use cases have to be summed it becomes clear that the total time for transition to a new ADF could be quite lengthy The longest transitional stage obviously is the development stage during which there are a lot of participants and steps The time between the distribution and the transition would depend on what was deemed to be a necessary threshold number of ECUs for the ADF to be installed prior to transitioning This threshold would most likely be determined by the DAA The total time for transition could be greatly shortened if there were an immediate need for a shorter transition time due to a potential compromise or technological advance The assumption here is that in most cases the useful life of an algorithm would be known and there would be an opportunity to transition to a new cryptographic algorithm prior to the algorithm expiring 5 REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT Throughout the use case development process various requirements were created for resolution of critical issues that was necessary to support the functions of the use case These requirements in conjunction with the requirements derived from the use cases created the complete set of CMI reprogrammability requirements The goal in this process was to create a set of requirements that can be implemented across all IA functions to reduce redesign per function Although the requirements may be program specific they can broken down into six main categories 7 S-Band for DoD systems is a low data rate band such as the SpaceGround Link Subsystem SGLS and the Unified S-band USB frequency between 1.7 GHz to 2.3 GHz These bands enable communication between the SOC and the satellite in support of launch early orbit activities anomaly resolution LEO&A and for TT&C during normal operations 7 


 Algorithm integrity specifications Identified integrity mechanisms for ADF receipt and retrieval from storage  Storage specifications Identified the verification and validation required when the ADF is pulled from memory in addition to the encryption required during storage Storage specifications also would include any assured hardware backup6 required within the ECU  Margin Identified the memory and processing capability required in excess of supporting the initial set of cryptographic algorithms and security functions for the mission  Process functions Identified the steps required for receipt installation and transition between ADFs in addition to supporting requirements Examples include dynamic transition to the new ADF without a degradation of capabilities ADF installation while not affecting other cryptographic functions operations and use of various algorithm suites  ECU management Identified the management functions that the ECU would support including the logging and auditing of specific events such as the receipt and installation of the new ADF  Delivery Identified the approved process for delivery of the ADFs to the distribution agent To complete the use case development process allocating the requirements to the correct document to be properly verified and tested was essential The two documents which authoritatively support CMI would be a System Technical Requirements Document TRD and a System Security Requirements SSR document An SSR is a document created by the NSA which defines the ECU requirements necessary for the ECU to be certified for use in DoD systems System-level requirements would be allocated to the system TRD and then flowed to the segments These requirements would include detailed exchanges between system segments and external entities to ensure synchronization ECU-specific requirements would be allocated to the SSR as an appendix Inclusion of the CMI ECU requirements into the SSR would ensure that products being reviewed by the NSA Technical Review Board are understood as a whole with all associated requirements The inclusion of the requirements also ensures that no conflicts exist between new requirements supporting CMI and existing SSR requirements Process Summary As identified in this paper many steps need to occur for a program to become CMI compliant in regard to reprogrammability These steps documented above can be leveraged for all future programs Figure 6 shows how the steps all fit together These steps and 8 6 An assured hardware backup is equivalent to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or another highly reliable nonprogrammable device Simultaneous use of a reprogrammable technology and an assured hardware backup will ensure continued operation if the reprogrammable component fails supporting details are the beginning of filling the knowledge gap revealed by CMI Use Case Development Review Review Policies System Development IA Functions Requirements Allocation Requirements TRD Derivation Distribution Transition SSR Figure 6 Process Summary 6 PRODUCTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE The IA product trade space for a satellite program includes commercial-off-the-shelf COTS government-off-the-shelf GOTS and program-developed products Identifying early in the program the existing IA products or those that are under-development that meet program requirements will reduce program risk which in turn will translate to cost and schedule savings The added benefit of integrating these products and more specifically the GOTS products into a satellite system will be a reduced burden of CMI on the satellite program GOTS products will be required to be CMI compliant which will reduce the burden on the program to determine how it should implement CMI IA products for a satellite system continue to be among the highest-risk products because of their lengthy certification process in addition to the continuously changing threat environment that the products need to mitigate When considering GOTS or COTS products under development the factors that need to be examined are requirements alignment product delivery dates and finally funding stability An analysis of alternatives should be done to ensure that the product chosen is the one best suited to the program As a risk-mitigation step the program might consider an offramp if there is significant risk of a late or incompatible product Upon selection of a product a best practice is to sign a Memorandum of Agreement MOA between the program and the developer or organization that will be providing the product The MOA ensures that the satellite program will purchase the ECUs and ensures that the requirements and timeline will continue to be aligned After a product selection is made the satellite program should communicate regularly with the supplying organization to avoid surprises due to changed requirements or delivery date slips For DoD systems holding discussions with one of the Service's Cryptographic Modernization Program Offices is 8 


advisable The program office would be aware of currentproduction ECUs in addition to ECUs under development Overall utilizing GOTS and COTS products for any program especially space programs in which research and development are extremely costly is essential for cost containment Additionally the use of these existing products facilitates interoperability with other ECU products which is one of the goals of CMI Relying on existing products is similar to relying on an existing infrastructure Once the requirements are in alignment and the product or infrastructure becomes available integration becomes less burdensome This will eventually become the case once the Key Management Infrastructure KMI becomes available to deliver ADFs An issue in the implementation of reprogrammable ECUs is the difficulty in determining the best method by which the ADFs should be delivered and who should be designated as the distribution agent Although this issue is not space specific due to the long lead-time required for development of space ECUs the issue is an especially time-sensitive one for space This long lead-time was validated by NSA IAD Director Daniel G Wolf who in 2005 said that the NSA established a Space IA Special Program Office to consolidate all of our support to the important and longlead-time programs 5 The end state for the ADF delivery method should be the use of the NSA KMI which was identified as a means to support the delivery of new algorithms in addition to the keys that support those algorithms Unfortunately the KMI program does not plan to support algorithm delivery in the foreseeable future Delaying this delivery support prevents near-term programs from becoming KMI compliant for algorithm delivery which in turn requires alternatives for ADF delivery to be considered After the KMI protocols for algorithm delivery are provided and adopted by the users this problem will become a non-issue How a program should approach this issue and the alternatives for addressing it are identified in Section 9 Phasing in the Transition When considering the choice of ADF distribution agent the primary focus should be on the scope of the ECUs that are affected Are the ECUs within one segment or in all segments or are they part of a larger group in which the satellite system is also just a part An associated issue relates to the ECUs all having the same design and their supporting a standard set of protocols If a limited set of ECUs is within a segment then perhaps that segment could be delegated as the distribution agent A best practice would be to have the MOS be the distribution agent so that the MOS would be aware of all the impacts to the system Instead of the MOS receiving a notice from the Space Segment that a transition is occurring the MOS would be in the driver's seat and would know about a transition before or at the same time that the Space Segment knows about it 7 PHASING IN THE TRANSITION As stated at the beginning of this paper a satellite program's goal should be complete compliance with CMI Because the definition for reprogrammability within CMI is limited and because it is not space-centric there is room for interpretation of the definition Depending on how the definition is interpreted a program may move forward in a way that meets the intent of the CMI and does not compromise the integrity of the satellite system This issue becomes important when discussing various opportunities for phasing in functions and technology to ensure the longterm success of a program The following subsections describe a proposed phased approach for a few areas in which a transition may be of benefit in achieving complete reprogrammability in space Level of Reprogrammability Determining the level of reprogrammability and which components of an ECU can be reprogrammed could follow a phrased approach The three potential levels of programmability could be 1 reprogramming a subset of the ECU's cryptographic algorithms and support software 2 reprogramming all ECU cryptographic algorithms and support software or 3 reprogramming all ECU cryptographic algorithms and support software in addition to ECU management functions Operational algorithms supporting COMSEC and TRANSEC would most likely be the first set of cryptographic functions in the subset that are found to be reprogrammable The second set of functions to consider is the set that supports the ECU itself which would include cryptographic algorithms supporting ADF integrity confidentiality wrapping unwrapping and key storage Applying this phased approach to the level of programmability meets the intent of the CMI without putting excess stress on the first space system to implement CMI As more systems are launched with reprogrammable ECUs the more functions that may be considered for reprogrammability Distribution For ADF distribution a common secure method or common set of methods to reprogram the ECUs needs to be defined to simplify and to standardize infrastructure support for secure rapid and responsive reprogrammability and software ordering distribution and loading which should be the goal of KMI's algorithm delivery capability in the future Meanwhile the near-term solution for ADF delivery will have to draw from the space contractor's proprietary methods Although this solution will meet the intent of the reprogrammability tenet of CMI it may not realize the full potential of connecting to the KMI This potential will be defined by the level of ECU reprogrammability which will determine if the ECU can support changes to the security functions required for KMI interoperability The medium-term solution is for programs to integrate the KMI algorithm delivery protocols once they become available into the ECUs while still utilizing their proprietary methods until KMI becomes available The final 9 


operational capability should be to implement the KMI protocols and utilize them upon product initialization This phased approach is necessary given that the KMI program has yet to deliver the algorithm delivery protocols Technology In Ensuring The Security Of Warfighters Satcom Via Programmable Cryptographic Devices various existing and emerging technologies were identified that could be leveraged for space applications The driving factor behind the use of emerging technology given the cost and inaccessibility of satellites is that absolute reliability and error-free operation are necessities The space community typically insists on the use of proven technologies e.g those at Level Six or Level Seven and above on the Technology Readiness Level scale used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and techniques to ensure the reliability of those technologies One path forward in beginning to use emerging technologies without assuming a considerable amount of risk is to utilize an assured hardware backup for reprogrammable components This option provides the ability to reprogram the ECUs if the opportunity presents itself while ensuring that the mission of the system will not be compromised while testing a new technology This ability is especially applicable to critical functions within the ECU After space-qualified Field-Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs or other reprogrammable technologies have proven their reliability in space environments an assured hardware backup can be minimized to reduce SWAP on the payload.7 Taking steps like these enables reprogrammability to be tested in space without jeopardizing expensive national assets The bottom line is this If the technology is available and proven it should be leveraged in the system Figure 7 shows the previously identified CMI transitions that can occur to support space-borne reprogrammable ECUs Although these transitions are stacked one on top of another in the figure in actuality they are independent of one another therefore one transition may occur prior to another Only time will tell how well space-borne ECUs will converge on complete compliance with CMI

been developed The NSA should create an official guidance document on how to apply the CMI tenets and more specifically how to apply the reprogrammability tenet to support future satellite programs Such guidance will help to alleviate confusion and will create a baseline upon which the CMI compliancy of other satellite programs may be assessed This baseline could include various aspects of reprogrammability but one that would be of great benefit is the margin memory and processing requirement for the ECU This margin requirement could be defined as a percentage over the initial required amount of memory and processing capability However if this margin were not calculated or estimated correctly it could defeat the entire purpose of CMI and negate all the work involved in making the ECU reprogrammable Each program would most likely have a different margin based on the number of IA functions supporting its mission which is why a baseline percentage would be the best way of identifying the margin requirement Although this margin may change over time due to technological or mathematical advances it would be a great starting point for a program The NSA will be the most-qualified organization to perform the margin analysis for the program The suggested process for performing a margin analysis should include a review of historical trends of the algorithms size and complexity discussions with subject matter experts in cryptographic algorithm development and a review of current operational algorithms and existing algorithms for future use This process should also include consideration of reserve capacity for increased code size to support function enhancements Each program and perhaps each of the programs ECUs depending on their function and size may have a different margin requirement 9 CONCLUSIONS This paper and the process it details help to fill a void in the knowledge base for implementation of cryptographic space products that was revealed by the NSA Cryptographic Modernization Initiative which forces space-borne ECUs to become reprogrammable The long lead-time for spaceborne ECUs makes it necessary to reduce the time spent on concept development so that efforts can be focused on ECU development This paper provides a foundation for a satellite program to begin its reprogrammability efforts The first step in this process is understanding reprogrammability and the space IA functions that it affects The next step calls for reviewing existing policies and publicly available best practices Reviewing existing documents will reduce rework especially given that CMI is required for all future parts of communication satellite payloads that are no less critical to mission effectiveness than ECUs 10 


programs and given the probable creation of additional policies and development of new best practices The primary focus of this paper is on three use cases which provide scenarios of the necessary steps to support reprogrammable ECUs Throughout the descriptions of the use cases several issues are identified and their solutions are discussed in depth These issues concern the selection of the ADF distribution agent and the ADF transition which all programs implementing CMI will need to address and can begin to address given the information provided in this paper Although each system may have a slightly different set of requirements the requirements will be similar to those derived from the use cases Products and infrastructure are addressed in this paper because one way of achieving CMI compliance is though the use of existing products Although integrating an existing product into a satellite system might not solve the CMI compliance issue it will certainly reduce the effort required for development The method of distributing the ADFs which should be done by KMI in the future serves to support the products Relying on an existing infrastructure is similar to relying on an existing product Once the requirements are in alignment and the product becomes available integrating the product into the system is easy Problems arise when there is limited understanding of the available functions or when product availability is unknown In the future KMI will be capable of supporting ADF distribution which will reduce a portion of the CMI implementation risk In the near term KMI will be phased in while the contractor-specified distribution method is phased out Technology the enabler of reprogrammable ECUs also needs to be phased in over time As each technology matures to support the space reliability requirement the assured backup can be minimized The remaining feature that should be phased in over time is the level of reprogrammability As satellite programs become more confident of their successful performance and the program's technology becomes more reliable additional portions of the ECU will become reprogrammable Finally the availability of a NSA policy on space-borne CMI compliance would greatly support future compliance efforts and allow for consistency and reuse of potential products In conclusion a CMI-compliant satellite system that supports the warfighter of the future is entirely feasible REFERENCES 1 Leveraging Cybersecurity Interview with Daniel G Wolf Military Information Technology Online Edition Volume 8 Issue 1 February 9 2004 www.militaryinformation-technology.com/article.cfm?DocID=389 Satcom Via Programmable Cryptographic Devices MILCOM 2005 October 19 2005 3 Kurt Bittner and Ian Spence Use Case Modeling 1st Edition Boston Addison-Wesley Professional 2-3 2002 4 CNNS Instruction No 4009 National Information Assurance Glossary June 2006 5 Assurance Provider Designing a Roadmap for Information Security Interview with Daniel G Wolf Military Information Technology Online Edition Volume 10 Issue 1 January 28 2006 http://www.militaryinformation-technology.com/article.cfm?DocID 1294 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank the TSAT Space IA team Maj Ryan Mattson Brian Sessler and Aaron Kuhn and the NSA Space SPO for their continued support to ensure the success of reprogrammable ECUs to support the warfighter BIOGRAPHY Joseph D Bull a Certified Information System Security Professional CISSP has more than five years of experience in system security engineering Currently he is an Associate at Booz Allen Hamilton where he is the Lead Engineer for Information Assurance for the Space Segment of the Transformational Satellite Communications System TSAT program He advises on various aspects of the TSAT architecture including TRANSEC COMSEC and CMI issues impacting the Space Segment and TSAT system He has also participated in the ECU requirements development process for the Air Force Cryptologic Systems Group's GOE Increment One and AVE Increment One TT&C ECU products While employed at Backbone Security he performed program assessments on a government agency enterprise Additionally while at Backbone Joe developed an automated tool to increase the timeliness and reliability of vulnerability assessments While working at the National Security Agency's Information Assurance Directorate he performed research and development on Bluetooth end-toend encryption utilizing Xilinx FPGAs Bull has an MBA from the Smeal College of Business at The Pennsylvania State University a BS in Electrical Engineering from Penn State and a BA in Physics from East Stroudsburg University 2 Joseph D Bull Ensuring the Security of Warfighters 11 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es — the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
