Towards a Pan European e-ID Interoperability Infrastructure  Arnold van Overeem Capgemini arnold.van.overeem@capgemini.com  Jos van Oosten Q-tips jos@qtips.nl    Abstract  The proliferation of e-Services in most European Countries has been favorable to the emergence of common  identity providers and national identity management infrastructures in these countries. The STORK project aims to interconnect all of these identity management infra-structures to form a PanEuropean federated e-Identity space. In this paper we show that due to two different identity concepts in use 
by the European countries, this objective is a far from trivial challenge Based on our analysis we present two scenarios homogeneous interoperability for countries with alike identity concepts and heterogeneous interoperability for countries with different identity concepts. For the latter case we present three solution directions to overcome technical limitations and challenges The STORK project is co-funded by the European Union and will deliver real solutions by implementing five demo projects  1. Introduction  In recent years significant progress has been made with the introduction of e-Services by public administrations. Although the ambition set by many 
governments in Europe [1 ha s no t  ye t b e e n a c h i e ve d   many countries now have e-strategie at ai m to  enable secure access to their e-Services for businesses and citizens. 7 countries are deploying eID cards and 14 more are currently designing eID cards for future roll-out. 14 countries have public sector controlled PKI schemes in place. 15 countries use multilevel authentication schemes for public services [3  Many e-Services store data about persons and require identification of the person who wants to use the service. This identification is needed to select the 
correct data that apply to the person requesting the service, but also to protect his privacy.  Some services require a payment for the delivery of the service, and some services are related to long term base registrations that may affect the future relation between a citizen or business and public administrations. Many e-Services only provide access to registered users Examples of e-Services that require identification and are candidates for cross-border access are: building permit request handling; subscription to university education; application fo r a driving license. A prioritized list of relevant e-Services has been 
developed by the European Commission Depending on the nature of the service, some degree of certainty must exist that a person who wants to access a service is appropriately identified and authenticated. For identification and authentication of users identity systems have been developed and alongside with these, identity management schemas. In many public e-Services persons could have several roles, e.g. be citizens, or business representatives or public servants. Access rights to services depend on the role of the person, and are generally managed by the providers of the services 
Traditionally each service provider or even each service had, in order to implement proper access restrictions for its services a proprietary identity management function, resulting for the users in an ever growing number of access codes to remember. With more and more services becoming e-Services the need for a common identity management infrastructure has become apparent d th i s is th e s u bj ect of th e  present paper. Identity providers as trusted 3rd parties that assure service users identity to multiple service providers have emerged as a solution. The STORK 
project aims to setup a Pan-European identity management infrastructure, that will enable citizens to have a single registration of their identity at a recognized identity provider and use the services of this identity provider to access all e-Services in all EUMember States and associated countries This ambition either makes the assumption that it will be possible to establish a Pan-European identity service, or to define a Pan-European standard for identity providers. In both cases the resulting identity management infrastructure must be capable to provide 
authentication with an adequate assurance level to any public e-Service across Europe The underlying assumption is that there is a priori agreement about the nature of identity itself; this however is being challenged [6 T h is paper rev i e w s  the fundamental differences in identity concepts, and in the way identities can be managed, and explores what Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


requirements an identity provider must fulfill to be compatible with an e-Service Based on our analysis we describe the generic relation between an identity provider and an e-Service provider [7 s described by B i rch  Elliott an d  McEvoy [8 t w o  f und a m e n t a l l y d i ffe r e nt r e l a t i o ns hi p s  exist, which have implications for the way e-Services can be supported by an external identity provider. In line with Martens we have dubbed these the blue model and the green model  1  In this paper we propose a procedural gateway as an enabler for cross-model interworking between eServices and identity service providers, as well as three different interim approaches that do not depend on a procedural gateway. We assume that interoperability concepts are relatively independent from identification methods, or that any dependencies can be solved on a national level. We also assume that the interoperability concepts for e-Identity are independent of the nature of the e-Services that require some form of identification  2. The nature of e-Identity  Identity is a subject of intense debate and research in the European Union for a number of years now [9 In this paper we will restrict the discussion about identity to people in any role. Some of the concepts and solutions also apply to legal entities and/or to animals and goods \(e.g. ship-containers\he main differences relating to identification / authentication methods Identity in the e-Services world usually is defined as a unique set of facts about a person that make him distinguishable from all other persons h is  definition has two flaws, which limit its usability in practice 1 Until all other persons have been identified, it is not certain that any given set of facts is really uniquely applicable to the single person of reference In some cases however, the degree of uncertainty can be significantly reduced by the availability of certain metadata about the facts 2 Data that represent facts about people may have different and unknown degrees of veracity, both because some described facts may change over time, or because the quality of the information itself is imperfect. This imperfectness can be due to inaccuracy, misinterpretation, misunderstanding and/or deliberate falsification, and further be complicated by   1  The terms blue and green do not have any other meaning then to reference the two fundamentally different concepts of identity that are discussed throughout this paper. This paper does not intend to express any preference for either concept, nor tries to present a comparative  overview of the two  the notion that a person may not want to reveal some facts in order to protect his privacy For practical purposes standard sets of facts about a person have come into use as source of identification.  Name \(Family Name, Given Name place and date of birth, is a commonly used set of identifying facts that turns out to be sufficiently unique in most cases and is generally believed to be invariant over time and legislatively neutral To address the veracity issues of identifying facts about a person, a plethora of other facts than the commonly used ones have been proposed and practiced, generally classified in knowledge related facts, possession related facts and biometric facts. An identification verification scheme based on a combination of facts out of all three classes, or at least two classes is usually called strong authentication  and is currently believed to guarantee a higher degree of veracity then a simple validation scheme based on a single class of facts In traditional daily life identifying facts support the person of reference, but do not replace him. In eServices however, the person himself is not involved and an identity record, containing or referring a set of facts about him acts as a substitute for the person in his relation to e-Services. This different role of the identity record, makes the veracity of the data much more important, and the vulnerability to identity related fraud much higher. The government, as a large provider of e-Services therefore is a stakeholder for quality assurance of identity records 2  This raises the question who owns identity records In most countries legislation has been passe h at  sets restrictions and requirements to organizations holding collections of personal records, but in most cases the ownership of the identity records is not clearly or not uniformly defined su bs equ e n t  years the evolution of identity management has come to two different and contradictory views on the nature of identities in a \(government owned\ data store 1 The identity record describes an identity which is an attribute assigned to a person in order to function as the digital representation of that person in one or more contexts 2 The identity record describes a person directly and may contain artificial attributes assigned to him by an identity service provider in order to represent him The latter approach places the identity provider as the master source of control, and rather would make the person an incarnation of the identity record.

identity provider defines and controls identity records even when the service user pushes the buttons His role often is limited to the selection of services and to validate his identity record. Typically each person is attached to one identity record, that may contain a wealth of privacy sensitive information, depending on what is required by various services. We call this the blue paradigm or blue model The former approach typically places the person himself as the master source of truth for the use of identity records. The person self is in control of identity records, and the iden tity provider is used to validate its content. A person typically can have multiple identity records, which may or may not share identifying facts, and that can be used in different contexts or for different roles that person may have We call this the green paradigm or green model In the green paradigm it is feasible that a single person owns multiple identities, typically related to different roles of that person, and it might be difficult or deliberately impossible to relate the provision of different  services to that person by different service providers, when these services where obtained using different roles. In the blue paradigm the sharing of the same identity record by multiple service providers would make a composite profile of the person much easier, and thus it would be much more difficult to maintain the privacy of the person. In the blue model a person s privacy is totally dependent on legislation and its flawless implementation In both models a priori trust relations are supposed to exist between the user and the identity provider, as well as between the identity provider and the service provider  2.1 Identity Management according to the blue model In Figure 1 a simplified schematic overview is given of a service delivery implemented according to the blue model. The model is simplified as much as possible. Essence of this model is that the identity provider represents the service user. The identity provider does not have to be a system, but can be any type of digital asset, the operational characteristics of which, are controlled by the identity provider. The service user can have any form, including internet access, mobile access, access by means of a call center etc. The service user must be authenticated prior to the service request handling. The service user is not involved in the exchange-of-credentials dialog, and therefore cannot immediately control what facts about himself are revealed to the service provider. Often a policy can be established at the identity provider Based on this policy the service provider will either get all requested facts about the service user registered at the identity provider, or the service request will be canceled It is to be noted that the identity provider has access to information about the service request that the service user issued, also when the service is denied, and therefore has the possibility to collect facts about the user that can be used in future service requests Because a trust relation is assumed between the service user and the identity provider this does not have to be a problem. However, this fact makes identity providers a prime target for identity related criminal engineering The user therefore is for the protection of his identity and credentials totally dependent on legislation and the proper implementation of it both at the identity provider and the service provider  Provider trust domain blue User trust domain blue 1 Claim Service 2 Authenticate 3 Request Service 4 Ask Credentials 5 Provide Credentials 6 Deliver Service Service user Identity provider Service provider 1 6 5 4 3 2  Figure 1 - Identity provision in the blue model  Each identity provider will usually support only one single instance of the service user, and the service user often is limited in his choice of identity provider by the identification methods that the service provider supports  2.2 Identity Management according to the green model In Figure 2 a simplified schematic overview is given of a service delivery implemented according to the green model. Again the model is simplified as much as possible. Essence of this model is that the user is in control each time a service provider asks for proper identification. The identity provider is not involved in the service request and delivery and the service user can decide when credentials are asked whether to authorize the provision or potentially select an alternative identity provider or cancel the service request It is to be noted that the service provider is not aware, which identity provider will be selected by the service user until the identity provider fulfills the credentials request on behalf of the service user.

authentication of the service user takes place after the inquiry for credentials by the service provider. Because a trust relation is assumed between the identity provider and the service provider, the service provider can rely on the veracity of the credentials Because this model implies a competitive position for identity providers, it is likely that identity providers in this model will support highly customizable and granularly configurable services. By allowing and enabling to expose different credentials to different service providers, the privacy of the service users can have a high degree of assurance. Identity related crime in this scheme is much more difficult, as is the identification of criminals on the basis of profiles  User trust domain green 1 Request Service 2 Ask Credentials 3 Authorize Exposure 4 Authenticate 5 Provide Credentials 6 Deliver Service Service provider Service user 1 2 Identity provider 3 5 6 Provider trust domain green 4  Figure 2 - Identity provision in the green model  3. Scope of research and approach  In this paper we analyze the interoperability of identity providers in a cross-border situation where service user and service provider operate under different legislative contexts and each have a different trusted identity provider For focusing our analysis, we used the layered interoperability model proposed by van Overeem Peristeras and W h ich is consis ten t w i th the European Interoperability Framework \(EIF  and resembles the layer cake proposed by Berners Lee  th i s  m odel f o u r  la y e rs of i n teroperabilit y are defined, named from top to bottom: procedural semantic, technical and trivial \(see Figure 3 The bottom layer defines network infrastructure and connectivity functions. We also assume a fully developed technical layer that handles any syntax formatting, language substitution, currency and measures conversion, and similar requirements. Any interoperability issues of the service provision context that causes or triggers the identity provision has been considered outside the scope of our research We assume that the minimum assurance level of an identity doesn t depend on the service provider or the Member State for the same class of services. If for example for the service selling wine the only identification requirement is to prove that the service user is at least 18 years of age, this is assumed to be applicable for all wine selling services in all Member States, and by implication that the name and place of birth will never be required by the service provider for this type of service In this paper we concentrate on the semantic layer and the procedural layer only. The semantic layer describes the exchange of meaningful information by transposing messages with retention of meaning across different semantic contexts using a common or compatible business process. The procedural layer describes the interaction patterns required to enable dissimilar or incompatible business processes to collaborate for a common goal, in this case identity provision in order to support e-Service authorization This restricts our research topic to the exchange of identity related information in the context of a well defined service request, for which a well defined form of authorization, based on a well defined degree of identification is required  Trivial layer exchange layer ensuring that information that has to be shared can be properly received and recognised Technical layer syntactic layer ensuring that information that has to be shared and is correctly received and recognised can be properly read characterset, syntax, data formats, currency, units, presentation language, etc Semantic layer ensuring that information that has to be shared and is correctly read can be properly understood context specific metadata, ontologies, taxonomies masterdata Procedural layer  \(process layer ensuring that information that has to be shared and is correctly understood can be properly acted upon \(legislation, objectives, priorities, resources, retribution, deeds  Figure 3 - Layered Interoperability Model  In section 4 we discuss the application of semantic solutions between identity providers using the same business process model. In section 5 we describe the application of procedural solutions to handle the interoperation of identity providers using different incompatible\iness processes. Whereas section 4 and 5 describe generic solutions, section 6 describes a specific solution for providing identity in the absence of an appropriate implementation of a procedural layer by using the semantic solutions from section 4 in combination with supplementary implementations specific to identity provision Once a service user has been identified \(and possibly strongly authenticated\e service provider obtains some facts about the service user, sometimes beyond what is required for identification or minimum verification of credentials Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


This paper does not make assumptions about the veracity of any facts about persons that may appear in personal records, nor about its usability to support service delivery to that service user. This paper also doesn t discuss what legal requirements would apply to the service provider or the identity provider with regard to the handling of these personal data In the rest of this paper we will purely focus on the interaction patterns between different identity providers, where one of them is trusted by the service user, the other by the service provider, and the identity providers are subject to legislation in different Member States. We will also not consider the degenerate case when the service user and the service provider use a common identity provider, as this case is assumed to be solved within the national context of the identity provider  4. Homogeneous Interoperability  We will now explore the complications that must be overcome in order enable cross-border service access. In our simplified model it is assumed that in each Member State a trust relation exists between the service user and an identity provider in that Member State, as well as another trust relation between the service provider and an identity provider in the other Member State. Each trust relation represents a business contract based on the applicable local legislation. As a consequence, cross-border service delivery requires the collaboration \(interworking\ of two different identity providers In this section we will discuss the situation when both identity providers operate under the same model either blue or green\. We have called this homogeneous interoperability. In the next section we will then discuss interoperability between identity providers operating under different models, which we called heterogeneous interoperability   4.1 Homogeneous interoperability between identity providers in the blue model  In this section we will first discuss interoperability between identity providers both operating under the blue model. A simplified interoperability scheme for the blue model is shown in Figure 4    Semantic gateway User trust domain blue Provider trust domain blue 1 Claim Service 2 Authenticate 3 Request Service 4 Transposed Service Claim 5 Transposed Service Request 6 Ask Credentials 7 Request identity validation 8 Update Credentials 9 Provide Credentials 10 Deliver Service Service user Identity provider Service provider 1 5 3 Identity provider 6 7 8 9 10 Semantic service request mapping 4 2  Figure 4 Cross border identity provision between blue environments  In essence the interaction between the service user and the identity provider in the source country is unchanged; authentication of the service provider takes place before the service request is forwarded; also the interaction between the identity provider in the target country and the service provider is unchanged. Added is an interaction pattern between the identity providers in both Member States As both identity providers assume the same semantics about the identity concept the exchange of credential updates  \(step 7 and 8\ may not necessarily require semantic conversion. Alternatively interaction 7 and 8\ay need to be routed via the semantic gateway. By having the service request \(step 3\ be semantically converted into a service claim \(step 4 behavior and business rules to be applied by the identity providers in both Member States are unaffected. A so-called semantic gateway [19 is capable to do that job. This semantic gateway mimics a generic service provider to th e identity provider that is trusted by the service user, and mimics a generic service user to the identity provider that is trusted by the service provider. In addition it maps the requested service to the corresponding service at the service provider. As both identity providers use the same identity concept and implement compatible or even identical business processes to support service provision, the semantic transformations can be on a message basis and only depend on generic metadata of the service users and the service providers  4.2 Homogeneous interoperability according to the green paradigm We now consider the case of interoperability between identity providers when both operate according to the green model. In Figure 5 a similarly simplified interoperability scheme for the green model Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


is shown. Again the interaction between the service user and the identity provider in the source country is unchanged; authentication takes place after the identity provider has been requested to endorse the claimed credentials; also the interaction between the identity provider in the target country and the service provider as well as the interaction between the service uses and the service provider is unchanged. Added is an interaction pattern between the identity providers in both Member States The semantic gateway must be involved in the original service request \(step 1,2\ order to create a context for credential mapping. Step 3, 7 and 9 also may have to be routed through the semantic gateway in order to map between different service contexts in both Member States. As in the blue scenario a semantic gateway may do the translation job, but this would be a totally differently configured semantic gateway as in the blue case  Semantic gateway Provider trust domain green User trust Domain green Identity provider Service user 1 Service provider Identity provider 4 5 1 Request Service 2 Transposed Service Request 3 Ask Credentials 4 Authorize Exposure 5 Provide Credentials 6 Transposed exposure authorization 7 Request credential update 8 Authenticate 9 Update credentials 10 Provide credentials 11 Deliver Service Semantic transposition of request and credentials 3 9 7 6 10 11 8  Figure 5 Cross border identity provision between green environments  Like in the blue model both identity providers use the same identity concept and implement compatible or even identical business processes to support service provision, the semantic transformations can be on a message basis and only depend on generic metadata of the service users and the service providers  5. Heterogeneous Interoperability  In this section we will explore the situation of interoperability between identity providers operating under different paradigms, ie one operating under the green model, and the other operating under the blue model  5.1  Interaction cases From the description of the homogeneous interoperability cases it is clear that interoperability between a green and a blue environment is significantly more complex. On the service user side the interaction pattern and the role of the identity provider must be maintained in accordance with either the blue or the green model, whereas on the service provider side the interaction and role of identity provider according to the other model must be mimicked. In particular the moment that authentication is required becomes more complex This situation of dissimilar business processes has been described befo d requ ires  th e intermediacy of a so-called procedural gateway We have two cases: a blue service user accessing a service from a green service provider, or a green service user accessing a service from a blue service provider. In both cases a conversion of business process \(as apparent from the interaction pattern\ in combination with semantic matching of data from the identity record is required. A semantic gateway cannot interfere with the business process, by definition, therefore a procedural gateway is required In the case of a blue user accessing a green service provider the procedural gateway must emulate a green user mapped to a blue identity provider to the green world and a blue service provider mapped to a green service provider to the blue world. The blue user is requested to authenticate prior to forwarding of a service request, and the procedural gateway must store the service user s credentials until in a later process stage the green service provider needs it In the case of a green user accessing a blue service provider, the procedural gateway must simulate a blue user to the blue identity provider and a green service provider to the green world. In this case the procedural gateway must store the potentially mapped\ervice claim until authentication has taken place by the identity provider in the blue service domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


5.2  Discussion The STORK project aims to be a generic solution for all cross-border e-Identity requirements. As shown in this paper four different cases exist, two of which are dependent on the implementation of a semantic gateway and two others on a procedural gateway as well as a semantic gateway. As the procedural gateway is a technical novelty, it is not proven that it can be built, and more precisely that it can be built within the allotted budget and timeframe of the STORK project Further complications arise when stepping back and considering the real environment. In reality individual service users access many different service providers in multiple Member States to obtain a variety of services. In our models we have disregarded the possibility of \(back-office interaction among service providers, in particular when this interaction involves personal records of the service user. An example of this would be the registration of a marriage between citizens of a blue and a green Member State in either a green or blue country. In a homogeneous blue or green environment this situation does not require any special consideration beyond what would be applicable within a single country operating that model, but in a mixed blue and green environment it does When collaboration between a blue and a green service provider happens, green service providers can be fed with blue identity records of green service users. This results in facts being exposed to the green service provider that would not have been exposed in a homogeneous green environment, and thus compromises the privacy of the green service user and since green service providers are not generally used to protect user data they generally don t get green identity providers become a more likely target of identity related crime, making the green service user more vulnerable to identity fraud Conversely, blue service providers can be fed with green identity records about blue service users Generally blue service providers cannot recognize these records as belonging to the same blue service user and therefore must assume it to be a different service user, or take the risk to merge service data from different users. In both cases this may result in inconsistent, duplicated or even erroneous service delivery, and in both cases legislation may be violated if single delivery of the service is mandatory An example of this is the delivery of digital tachograph card  to a truck driver  6. Directions to solve semantic identity mismatches  From our discussion about interaction patterns between service providers operating across blue and green models, it follows that the political requirement to achieve Pan-European e-Identity interoperability goes beyond what can be done with just ICT solutions. An obvious political way out of the conflicting requirements of the blue and the green model is that all stakeholders agree to adopt either the green or the blue model as the national standard model. We believe that this is not going to happen Both green and blue Member States already have too deeply invested in legislation and technology  to accept conversion either from green to blue or from blue to green. In many cases citizens already possess digital assets, either in conformance with the green or the blue paradigm, and many third parties already hold digital records with personal data implemented in conformance with either blue or green legislation. Our conclusion is that we either find a technical solution between green and blue identity models, or we embark on a degraded alternative A generic and broadly acceptable, technically feasible interoperability solution between green and blue environments requires the development and deployment of a procedural gateway as well as further elaboration. As, in view of the before mentioned complications, this can be impeded by legislative barriers, some degraded solutions can be implemented that avoid the complexities of the crossenvironment solutions described in section 5, at least for an interim period These interim solutions suppose the parallel development and deployment of two Pan-European e-Identity spaces that cover the blue and green Member States, respectively, but put the burden of the incompatibilities between the green and the blue environments outside the domain of ICT interoperability solutions, into the domain of the stakeholders. So far we have identified three different types of stakeholder who can be burdened with the interoperability conflicts between green and blue environments 1  The service user can be targeted as a potential contributor to an interim solution 2  The service provider can de targeted as a potential contributor to an interim solution 3  The government in its role as legislator can be burdened with the interoperability problems Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


This approach transforms the cross-border interoperability case into two parallel homogeneous interoperability cases as described in section 4 \(both blue and green  6.1. Dual identity provision for service users The basic idea of the first solution is that a blue and a green interoperability world do coexist. Several Member States already are committed to either the blue or the green model. Ultimately, each Member State either implements the blue or the green model and the associated homogeneous interoperability solution as described in Figure 4 or Figure 5 respectively. In addition, service users, that require the use of services from the other domain will be allowed to have a dual identity, independently managed by himself \(for his green identity\ and an identity provider in a blue country. This requires legal provisions for service users from green Member States to acquire a second blue identity from any blue Member State, as well as being enrolled in all kinds of e-Identity support programs. It may also require legal provisions to be allowed to use self managed identities provided by a green country to users in blue countries The scope of this dual identity provision needs further study but could well include the consequence of providing dual \(electronically readable / writable identity documents, \(e.g. passports 3 tokens and or administrative provisions. Administratively these service users would be duplicated, with one instance managed in a blue Member State and the other instance self managed from a green Member State The acceptability of this solution will decrease as the number of service users benefiting from this approach increase. This can be easily understood by considering that from a statistical point of view the service user himself is the only one that knows the difference between himself as a service user with dual identities in green, resp. blue environment and two independent service users that only operate in either green and blue Member States, respectively Providing selectively a dual identity thus creates a semantic aggregation conflict between users and their identity records. This conflict should be kept limited to a marginal problem. Whereas the deployment cost of this solution is relatively low, the indirect costs can potentially explode when usage grows beyond a negligible percentage   3  Of course the booklet does not have to be duplicated, but all machine readable digital identity records, e.g. embedded RFIDchip would have to be implemented in a green and a blue version It is very unlikely that green and blue identity records completely can be implemented using a single common standard only   6.2. Dual identity handling by service providers Instead of administratively duplicating the service user a duplicated service provider interface could be implemented. Each Member State  would implement dual versions  of each relevant service that would need to be accessed by either service users from blue and green Member States, respectively The problem with this solution approach is that it highly depends on the nature of the service what the impact is of this approach. In a minimal case, where the service itself does not involve any personalized information of the service user, for example, when the only identification objective is to let the user pay for the service, it can be adequate to just have a duplicated service portal for green and blue environments, respectively, whereas the service behind the portal is shared. But in other cases, that more deeply involve service user identity related activities, several other components of the service may need to be duplicated. In the worst case the entire service has to be duplicated, and back-end integration between the two service versions is necessary The problem is that this kind of solution depends on the degree of duplication required. In a minimum scenario \(only duplicate service portals\ a small additional cost for implementing and maintaining a separate portal for service users of the other color is the only consequence. In the other extreme, services may have to be re-engineered in order to be able to support dual blue and green identity management schemes. In contrast with the dual identity approach this approach is more feasible when a significant number of cross over service users needs to be accommodated A second type of problem that can occur is the risk of unavoidable semantic integrity conflicts, in particular when a fraudulent scheme could be setup using \(fake\al identities from green and blue Member States. For each individual service a careful analysis is required before a duplication for green and blue environments can be implemented The cost profile of this solution is characterized by a high initial cost, that scales linearly with the services being provided, and running costs after deployment that are relatively small, and not dependent on scale  6.3. Ignoring the semantic conflict with backup in legislation A third way to address the conflicting blue and green identity management scheme is by technically Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


ignoring it, and providing backup by legislation. In this case parallel green and blue e-Identity spaces would exist which are unconnected in the virtual world. The only bridging would be in the real world This would work as follows 1  Legislation will be implemented that defines that in all circumstances service users from a green Member State are protected by green legislation, also when obtaining services from a blue service provider 2  Similar legislation will be implemented that defines that in all circumstances service users from a blue Member State are protected by blue legislation, even when obtaining green services 3  The service providers technically implement a blue or green solution in line with their national policies and legislation, and are prepared to handle manual corrections whenever issues arise with a service user from a Member State of the other color  Like in the first case, this approach can only be acceptable when it applies to a limited number of cross-color cases. Even when only a few percent of service users obtain services from a cross-color service provider, we may assume that even then the majority of cases does not raise issues The complexity of this approach is that a sufficiently homogeneous legislation within both the group of blue Member States and within the group of green Member States is assumed. In detail this assumption is not entirely correct, and therefore implementation of this approach is likely to require complex and time consuming negotiations both in the group of blue and the group of green Member States An overview of the main advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions are summarized in Table 1 The research program of the STORK project will make a more in depth assessment of these strengths and weaknesses of each approach  Table 1 Overview of Evaluation criteria of Procedural Solutions Evaluation criteria Dual identity Dual provision Legal cover Legislative overhead Only initial Only initial Both initial and continuous Scalability Restricted to low volume Yes Restricted to low volume Dual passports, tokens etc Probably required Not necessary Not necessary Service independence Yes No Yes Fraud vulnerability Service independant potentially low Service dependant potentially high Service independant potentially high Demographic pollution Yes No No Service integrity Not impacted Service dependant Service dependant   7. Conclusions and research directions  The STORK project aims at implementing an EU wide interoperable system for recognition of eID and authentication that will enable businesses, citizens and government employees to use their national electronic identities in any Member State. It will also pilot cross-border e-Govern ment identity services and learn from practice on how to roll out such services and to experience what benefits and challenges an EU wide interoperability system for recognition of eID will bring The STORK interoperable solution for electronic identity \(eID\will be based on a distributed architecture that will pave the way towards full integration of EU e-Services while taking into account specifications and infrastructures currently existing in EU Member States. The solution provided is intended to be robust, transparent, safe to use and scalable, and should be implemented in such a way that it is sustainable beyond the life of the pilot The  STORK project will   Develop common rules and specifications to assist mutual recognition of eIDs across national borders   Test, in real life environments, secure and easy-to-use eID solutions for citizens and businesses   Interact with other EU initiatives to maximize the usefulness of eID services Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


It will do so by preparing for and implementing several pilots with services that will have significant potential impact and are adequately secure, by making use of open standards where possible and respecting with data protection regulations. The pilots will test the common specification on eID for several applications that have a substantial impact on eGovernment across Europe The interoperability solutions discussed in this paper will be used as templates for real implementation  8.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didnt measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with variable-le ngth arrays  lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting variablelength arrays to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding. We are also looking at provide similar, but less aggressive, optimization support for schemaconforming documents REFERENCES  Nokia Web Services  Helping Operators Mobilize the Internet Http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/whitepapers/W S_Operators_A4_0408.pdf  The SAX Project. http://www.saxproject.org  XML Pull Parsing. http://www.xmlpull.org  W3C Document Object Model http://www.w3.org/DOM  WAP Binary XML Content Format http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml  Efficiency Structured XML. http://www.esxml.org  VTD-XML. http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net  XSLTC Documentation. http://xml.apache.org/xalanj/xsltc  kXML. http://www.kxml.org  Liefke, H. and D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
