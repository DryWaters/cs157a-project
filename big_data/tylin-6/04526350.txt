I NTRODUCTION  The MESSENGER spacecraft is on an interplanetary cruise that will end on March 18, 2011, when MESSENGER will be the first spacecraft to or bit Mercury. MESSENGER will carry out a broad range of observations of Mercury for one Earth year including a radio science investigation to determine whether the planet has a liquid core MESSENGER’s instruments will collect data to be stored on the spacecraft’s solid-state recorder \(SSR forwarded to NASA’s Deep Space Network \(DSN received on Earth, the DSN will then forward scientific and spacecraft housekeeping data to the MESSENGER Mission   1  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00©2008 IEEE  2  IEEEAC paper 1630, Version 
5, Updated January 17, 2008  Operations Center \(MMOC\urel Maryland. The robustness of MESSENGER’s onboard data file system will help to enhance the quantity of scientific data beyond  While in Mercury orbit, MESSENGER will contact the DSN 12 times per week to downlink data to Earth, with each contact lasting approximately eight hours. The quantity and quality of scientific data that can be expected to be returned from Mercury is determined by several factors: \(1 the DSN contact schedule, which is established by agreement prior to launch, \(2\he spacecraft’s radio frequency \(RF\ telecommunication subsystem design and effective isotropic radiated power \(EIRP\, \(3\he DSN’s nominal performance including antenna and receiver 
performance, and \(4\ink margin requirements imposed by the mission team. For MESSENGER, the minimum required science data return objectives are met. The techniques outlined below show how optimization and link margin reductions allow enhanced science return without sacrifice of data quality by means of a hybrid approach to the physical and protocol layers to ensure data integrity  Link margin is required to assure that the scientific data will not be lost by deviations from the expected performance Deviations can include weather, solar noise, wind, and random antenna pointing errors \(both spacecraft and DSN In the case of MESSENGER the baseline link margin is 1.5 dB  The DSN’s nominal performance is not fixed but is often treated as such for simplicity 
Such a first-order approach with a static model of DSN performance, however, will not yield an optimum link design. Optimizing a deep space telecommunications link almost always translates into maximizing the ground-received signal-to-noise ratio. Prelaunch estimates of data return for MESSENGER were nonoptimized  The DSN’s performance is ante nna specific and varies with antenna elevation angle Recent 34m beam wideguide BWG\ntenna performance upgrades have been  completed by the DSN to DSS-26 Goldstone, California, DSS-34 Canberra, Australia and DSS-55 Madrid, Spain, which have significantly improved their overall performance. The resulting performance improvement better allows for 


2 optimization techniques to be pursued because the atmospheric noise as a function of elevation angle is a larger portion of the total noise. Atmospheric noise can be a significant challenge at low an tenna elevation angles.  The signal from the MESSENGER spacecraft passes through multiple effective layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, due to the slant angle effect, thus attenuating the signal more than if the signal passed through a single layer of the atmosphere at zenith. As an example, at a 10 degree elevation angle a 34m antenna, DSS-24 in Goldstone, California, has an atmospheric noise temperature, T atm of 15.38 K or 5.63 air masses   The receiver electronics are cr yogenically cooled to reduce the additive noise of the active device so that it can receive extremely small signals from throughout the solar system Waveguide loss, spillover, scatter and other losses are combined with th e noise temperature of the receiver electronics to form the noise temperature, T vac which is the effective noise temperature of the ground antenna in the absence of atmosphere. The gain G, of an antenna reflector changes with elevation angle due to the deformation of the main antenna reflector from the rigging point, typically a 45 degree elev erefore, the gain-to-noise temperature of a DSN antenna at a given elevation angle is     K dB T G sys 1  vac sys T T T   atm K  2  The changing gain-to-system noise temperature of an antenna, a key metric of DSN performance, makes optimization possible by changing the science return data rate to match the changing G/T sys thus maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio at the antenna  Science data return can be managed in several ways depending on the needs and risk tolerance of the individual mission.  Mission operation teams can use a “set and forget approach, meaning the science return data rate for an individual communication pass uses a single rate based on the worst G/T sys of all DSN antennas of the same size at a set elevation angle and worst case weather conditions. This approach allows mission planners to anticipate and easily accommodate last minute ante nna changes to the DSN schedule due to last minute maintenance, non-functioning antennas, mission emergencies or other local DSN issues This approach does not allow for any degree of optimization but makes data rate management simple from a planning and execution perspective. Th is paper will compare this approach to an ante nna specific optimized link design using CFDP 2.MESSENGER S L INK S TRATEGY  Optimization techniques have been previously explored to improve data return using the DSN at X-band and Ka-Band by taking advantage of changes in G/T sys over the course of a communications contact with a spacecraft a n  operational standpoint changing the data rate to match the changing G/T sys performance or lowering the link margin does impose challenges that could prove to outweigh the advantages of additional scientific data. As an example when files are transmitted fr om the spacecraft’s SSR to the MMOC, data will be missing because of changes in data rate or a negative link margin. In the absence of an automatic re-transmission protocol, the mission operations teams will have to identify th e missing pieces of the files and then, at a later track command the spacecraft to play back the missing file pieces. M eanwhile, the file on the SSR cannot be deleted until it and all other files have been examined for missing data, even though additional files are being added to the SSR. Depending on the speed and frequency of DSN contacts an SSR oversubscription can occur. Human error can also cau se files to be deleted from the SSR before the missing data can be reconciled 3.MESSENGER  F ILE BASED  SYSTEM MESSENGER’s scientific in strument and spacecraft housekeeping data are downlinked from the spacecraft’s onboard file system by a standard defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems \(CCSDS called the CCSDS File Deliver y Protocol \(CFDP\[6   CFDP is a protocol developed by CCSDS for the transmission of files from tw o entities in a space network Similar in concept to the File Transfer Protocol \(FTP\sed in terrestrial networks, it is designed to operate across space links that typically have intermittent connectivity, long delays, and high error rates. The entities in the MESSENGER architecture are: 1 the spacecraft’s on-board file system and the protocol layer; 2\ the MMOC ground software; and 3\ the MESSENGER X-band RF Telecommunications Subsystem acting as the physical layer between the two locations. JHU/APL engineers implemented the flight software and integrated a CFDP core, developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\nto the standard ground software [7 8 nfigu r ab le to  perform both reliable and unreliable transmissions MESSENGER uses reliable transmission  CFDP operates on a series of transactions, each of which constitutes the transmission of a file from one data store to another. For MESSENGER the operations team transfers files only from the spacecraft to the ground, as legacy software is used to send data in the opposite direction. A file transfer is initiated either by the on-board software or via an operations command as shown in Figure 1. To begin the transaction, a metadata protocol data unit \(PDU\s transferred to the ground. Th is PDU contains information such as the identifier for this transaction as well as the filename. Following this transmission, the CFDP software subdivides the file into multiple file data units or FDUs. The spacecraft radiates these FDUs until all data from a file have been sent. The software th en signals this event by transmitting an end of file \(EOF\is point, the 


3 CFDP software starts a timer to ensure that a reply to this EOF is received within a reasonable time    Fig. 1 CFDP transaction between the MMOC and the MESSENGER spacecrafts onboard file systems  While the flight software is sending the various PDUs, the MMOC software is collecting the pieces of the file for storage in the mirrored file system on the ground. The software is also verifying that all pieces of a file are received. Once an EOF PDU is collected on the ground and an acknowledgment \(ACK\smitted to the spacecraft to conf irm reception, the gro und software in the MMOC notifies the spacecraft what pieces of a file, if any are missing through a negative acknowledgement \(NAK PDU. When the flight softwa re receives this PDU, it retransmits the missing FDUs to the ground. Then, if the MOC CFDP determines that the file is complete, it radiates a finished indicator \(FIN to the spacecraft signifying the successful transmission of the file. The flight software completes the handshake by sending a FIN ACK to the ground, and the transaction is complete and the file is deleted from the SSR  The MESSENGER team operates CFDP in real time meaning that underlying software communicates during the pass to transport, handshake and delete files. CFDP requests only those pieces of the file that are missing sending the requests in real time or, if the pass is complete during the next available contact. Missing FDUs have priority for playback over all other files in the file systems 4.H YBRID BASED O PTIMIZATION  CFDP enables techniques for link optimization to be pursued without encumbering the mission operations team to identify and reschedule transmission of dropped or missing FDUs.  It also avoids the risk of losing highly valuable scientific data from the oversubscription of the recorder that may come if th e file deletions are delayed MESSENGER conducted several in-flight experiments incorporating the following strategies for link optimization and improved science return using CFDP  1  Reduce the science return downlink margin—from 1.5 dB to 0.5 dB 2  Implement a stepwise-variable downlink rate adjustment—change the downlink bit rate for every 0.5 dB change in G/T sys and maintain the minimum link margin of 0.5 dB over the course of the communications period 3  Select a downlink rate commensurate with the current elevation angle based on a model of individual antenna performance, with consideration of weather, solar and wind conditions instead of minimum elevation and weather worst case weather assumed in the planning phase  Both physical and protocol layers are used to ensure data integrity. If a downlink transfer frame is not correctable by the DSN using the physical layer the transfer frame is not sent to the MMOC and will be missing. The protocol layer CFDP, will recognize that downlink FDUs are missing and request a retransmission 5  S CIENCE D OWNLINK L INK M ARGIN  The variability of an X-band RF link due to weather conditions is not large as for Ka-band. Table 1 shows the weather variability of an X-band link at DSS-34 at 10 degrees and 80 degrees elevation. The column labeled Weather Conditions" refers to the percent of time that the G/T performance exceeds th  Table 1.

However, if the link was designed for 20 percent weather conditions then weather conditions could reduce the availability of the link until the antenna elevation angle increases sufficiently to overcome the margin deficit this is especially true at low elevation angles  Variability due to circumstances such as wind and antenna pointing accuracy were consider ed static conditions for the experiments outlined in this paper. The MESSENGER spacecraft was giving a 0.1 dB pointing accuracy loss and 


4 the DSN was 0.2 dB loss for wind conditions and deformation of the aperture. Any variability outside these static conditions was not considered  If the variability of the link caused by weather, wind or pointing error exceeded the 0.5dB link margin then CFDP would be required to retransmit the data that were missing  The net observed increase in da ta volume cause by lowering the link margin from 1.5dB to 0.5 dB is   log 10 1        dB  3   is the total frames minus the frame errors from all random sources divided by the total number of frames received  If the link frame error rates exceeded the net increase in data to be gained by lowering the link margin form 1.5 dB to 0.5dB, the added benefit would not be realized. Therefore careful modeling of the link is required 6  D OWNLINK R ATE A DJUSTMENTS  Table 1 demonstrates that as the antenna elevation angle rises or lowers so does the G/T sys performance of the antenna system.  To take advantage of the changing G/T sys  the downlink bit rate can be changed to mirror the changing G/T sys Due to the MESSENGER spacec raft architecture, the downlink rate cannot be changed continuously with G/T sys  therefore, can only be changed in a stepwise fashion.

In doing so, the total science volume for the mission can be increased as opposed to applying a worst case an tenna performance model to science volume calculations. Th e use of worst case antenna performance allows antennas of similar size to be swapped in the DSN schedule with little or no consequences to the expected science data return, but does not allow for optimization    Antenna  DSN  Case Worst Antenna  DSN  Targeted  90  10     012 sys sys T G T G dB   6

Also shown is the G/Tsys of DSS-26 on DOY 333 with 20% weather and 0.5 dB margin and 90% weather and 1.5 dB margin  A total science return improvement can be now calculated using a reduced link margin, stepwise downlink rate and a targeted antenna performa nce approach using   012       dB  7 8.I N F LIGHT P HYSICAL L AYER R ESULTS  Six in-flight experiments were conducted to measure the science improvement and re sulting overhead using the previously described link optimization strategy. The experiments were conducted in 2006 on DOY 324 with DSS-26, DOY 329 and 331 with DSS-14, DOY 333 with DSS-26 and DOY 334 and 345 with DSS-34 3 Figure 2 shows the data rates flown on DOY 333 and the corresponding G/T sys Also shown in Figure 2 for comparison is single rate approach if the 1.5 dB margin and 90% weather and its corresponding G/T sys   Table 2 shows the results of all experiments and the physical layer interaction with the in-flight experiment. It can be seen that a very small overhead is associated with an average overall gain of 3.357 dB over a conventional worst case fixed bit rate design with link margin 1.5 dB  To verify the techniques presented in this paper, the MESSENGER team developed a two phase approached to examine throughput.  The first phase, described below, was a proof of concept and developed to ensure minimal impact   3 Experiments conducted on DOY 333 th rough 345 were conducted using 20% planned weather conditions. A ll others were conducted at 90 planned weather conditions to current operations.  A second, longer campaign will be conducted later in 2008 Table 2.

If the overhead of the protocol layers is high, it could nullify the resulting throughput increase of the physical layer. To demonstrate that is not the 


6 case for CFDP, the results from DOY 333 will be analyzed The DOY 333 results represent measured protocol layer throughput during the test. Four transactions were active during this pass, as shown in Table 3. Playback began with the completion of a NAK for transaction 454 from a previous pass. This was followed by the playback of transactions 457, 458, and 456. Transaction 456 was also a file continuing from a previous track, but it was preempted by the higher priority 457 and 458 transactions. The computed bit rates shown in th e table are somewhat variable due to the granularity of the available telemetry and ground data  Table 3. Transactions on Day 333, 2006  ID Size bytes Playback Bit Rate \(bps Computed Bit Rate \(bps 454 142854 4167 4024 457 929291 4167 4022 458 510739 4167 4025 456 2137400 4167 4031 456 1052400 4695 4541  During this session, mission operations configured MESSENGER to use two bit rates during which playback was active: \(1\208.30 bps and \(3\ 5868.51 bps, and they also configured the spacecraft to transmit 4 file data frames to every one real-time frame. These settings provide effective science data rates of 4166.64 bps and 4694.81 bps respectively, given the ratio above. Using the observed flight data, CFDP adds approximately 1.2% to 1.4% of overhead which, together with framing overhead, gives the rates shown in Table 3. A transfer frame is 1115 bytes, of which 1095 are available for sc ience data transfer. A typical conservative setting for the downlink rate during this phase of the mission is 2422.48 bps using a 10 degree starting elevation angle on 90% weather with 1.5 dB margin Playback was active for 9319s. With the real-time/playback ratio of 4:1, the effective do wnlink rate for science data would be 1903 bps given no additional overhead burden from CFDP. With this rate and the amount of available downlink time, 2216757 bytes would have been downlinked versus the 4772684 bytes of science data downlinked during the actual playback period 10  CFDP  R ETRANSMISSION AND L ATENCY  Day 329 is an example of data retransmission by CFDP Table 4 shows the transactions active during this pass During this pass, several files required retransmission of data due to either drops in the link or switching between data rates  Figure 3 represents CFDP operations during this playback period. Transactions 35-49 are represented by bars in the figure when that particular transaction was active in the playback queue. Multiple transactions required retransmissions due to either the commanded downlink rate switches \(shown in yellow\or link dropouts \(shown in red A CFDP FDU is 1024 bytes which is slightly smaller than the available data size in a transfer frame. Hence, the majority of transfer frames contain the end of packet and the beginning of another. Therefore the loss of one downlink transfer frame results in the lo ss of two CFDP packets. This loss is recognized by the gr ound CFDP software which sends NAKs to the spacecraft listing the pieces of the file that are missing. This is represented by the NAKs shown on the right side of the graphic. Additionally, a portion of the pass was devoted to retransmission of data from a previous pass  For missions that have large round trip light times or large file sizes or both, file latency caused by CFDP retransmission could impose challenges to SSR management and SSR size requirements.  In addition missions that have time critical data such as navigation images may want to avoid the uncertainty of variable file arrival times due to retransmissions and added round trip light times  The results in Table 4 show that the 46.6 % of the files required an additional retransmission or one or two FDUs As the files are sliced into multiple FDUs, only the individual missing FDUs require retransmission as opposed to the entire file.  That equates to 2 additional round trip lights time or the next available contact for the file to be complete. 53.3% of the files were able to be complete on the first transmission from th e spacecraft to the MMOC      Table 4.

Playback Results on Day 33, 2006  11  S UMMARY  In-flight testing of the MESSENGER spacecraft demonstrated that a lowered link margin and stepwise changes in downlink data rate can significantly increase science volume without additional burden to the mission operations team using CFDP. CFDP added a small overhead to the downlink that was more than offset by the added volume obtained by the margin reduction and stepwise downlink rate changes. The above could be applied to Kaband operations where link variability is an even more substantial concern  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors thank Bob Nelson of the MESSENGER Mission Operations Team for his hard work and support to make the in-flight experiments possible, as well as Scott Burleigh of JPL for his comprehensive responses to questions on the intricacies of CFDP during software development.

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
