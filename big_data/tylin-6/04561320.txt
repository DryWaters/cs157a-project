HIDD E N Hausdorff distance based Intrusion Detection approach DEdicated to Networks Yann Labit Johan Mazel LAAS-CNRS Universit e de Toulouse 7 avenue du Colonel Roche 31077 Toulouse cedex 4 FRANCE  ylabit jmazel  laas.fr Abstract DoS attacks represent a big threat for the Internet While most of attack detection techniques are based on passive monitoring of trafﬁc we propose a detection method HIDD E N based on active measurements the objective being to make possible the real-time detection and classiﬁcation of DoS attacks without intrusive probing The originality of our contribution relies on the use of the entropy function computed from probabilities of time series of measured ICMP request/echo delays However the evaluation of the method exhibits a dramatic number of false positives It has then been enriched by the use of the Hausdorff distance on probabilities of time series which signiﬁcantly decreases the number of false positives In addition a method for discriminating ICMP attacks from others TCP/UDP attacks using icmp seq has been added Experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach have been run on the French operational RENATER network on which artiﬁcial attacks have been generated using TFN2K 14  R es ul t s exhibit that TCP UDP and ICMP DoS attacks have been accurately detected in less than 1 second 1 Introduction DoS attacks represent a big threat for the Internet and their detection and mitigation is a key research issue Most of previous work on attack detection has been concentrating on monitoring traf\036c using passive measurement techniques as in Intrusion Detection Systems This paper proposes an alternative approach based on active measurements the objective being to make possible the real-time detection of DoS 037ooding attacks without intrusive probing It relies on the assumption that delays will be impacted in case of attack The advantage of active measurement is its user oriented nature which allows anybody to cope with DoS attack detection whereas it is usually devoted to network administrators The end to end approach of active measurements also makes possible to detect attacks anywhere in the Internet from any source Active measurements would then signi\036cantly ease the design of a global attack detection system for the Internet Active measurements are very popular in the Internet for measuring delays loss rates inferring network topologies etc They are also used for estimating available bandwidth see tools as Abing Spruce Pathload IGI-PTR Pathchirp etc As for our attack detection method these tools aims at interpreting delay variations on pairs or trains of packets as changes in the link or path load 11  Ou r m eth o d th en r e lies o n a n a ly zing time series of measured ICMP request/echo delays The originality of this method relies on how this time series are computed in order to exhibit anomalous values corresponding to DoS 037ooding attacks and classifying them For this purpose and taking advantage of previous work on anomaly passive detection which demonstrated the bene\036ts of spectral 8 o r e nt rop y 6 a nal y s i s  our det ect i o n m et hod al s o computes the entropy from probabilities of RTT time series However 036rst results when working on the entropy function only were not convincing because of a high rate of false positives The methodology has been extended by the use of the Hausdorff distance on probabilities of time series which proved to signi\036cantly reduce this level of false positives Moreover it increases the level of true positives detected by the entropy function The paper is organized as follow section 2 presents the two needed concepts of entropy and Hausdorff distance Section 3 presents how our detection method HIDD E N has been assessed Especially it indicates how RTT time series in the presence of attacks have been built Then in section 4 experimenting our detection method on this RTT time series repository it has been possible to show that thanks to the Hausdorff distance estimations DoS attacks have been accurately detected in less than 1 second It also shows how the method performs in discriminatin g between ICMP and TCP/UDP attacks Section 5 proposes an evaluation of performances about false/true positives/negatives and the choice of Hausdorff distances Finally section 6 concludes the paper by describing ongoing and future work for improving and validating this method

2 Entropy and Hausdorff distance concepts 2.1 Entropy The entropy of a distribution was de\036ned by Shannon for the discrete laws de\036ned by its probabilities and was extended then to the continuous laws de\036ned by their density The entropy received a strong attention in information theory with physical analogies but it has also speci\036c properties to its probabilistic origin The relative entropy shows the difference between the distribution of the packet serie in the current network traf\036c and a well-known distribution packet serie If this difference is too large it indicates that a portion of some packet serie that rarely appear in the training data increases signi\036cantly or that appear regularly decreases signi\036cantly In other words this serves as an indication of the presence of an anomaly in the network traf\036c Entropy aims at measuring the uncertainty degree of various random experiments The use of entropy concept is motivated in this work by the need to estimate the disorder level in probabilities of RTT time series 2.1.1 Renyi and Shannon entropies It is often convenient to introduce generalized Renyi entropies before giving the Shannon one The Renyi entropy is a generalisation of Shannon entropy to quantify the uncertainty or randomness of a system The Renyi entropy of order 002 is de\036ned as R 002  X  1 1  002 log  n 003 i  1 p 002 i  1 where 002 002  0 p i are the probability distributions of  p 1  p n   which consist of non-negative numbers summing up to unity The Renyi entropy R 002 converges to the Shannon entropy in the limit 002 003 1 R 1  X   n 003 i  1 p i log  p i  2 2.1.2 Renyi divergences As well as the absolute Renyi entropies there exist the generalised relative divergence of order 002 which described an approximate distribution Q  X  from a well-known distribution P  X   D 002  P 004 Q  1 1  002 log  n 003 i  1 p 002 i q 002  1 i  3 The divergence of order 002  1de\036nedas D 1  P 004 Q  n 003 i  1 p i log p i q i 4 is the Kullback-Leibler divergence This last one has been used in MetroSec Project 10 i n pas s i v e det e ct i o n 12   2 In t h i s w o rk t he R e n y i e nt rop y and d i v er gence o f o rder 002  1areused 2.2 Overview of Hausdor\002 distance The Hausdorff distance measures how far two compact non-empty subsets of a metric space are from each other in topology Letís give an overview of the Hausdorff distance and a number of formulations about it 2.2.1 Directed Hausdorff distance and undirected Hausdorff distance Given two 036nite point sets A   a 1   a p  and B   b 1   b q   the Directed Hausdorff Distance DHD is de\036ned as h  A  B  max a 005 A min b 005 B 004 a  b 004 5 with d  a  B  min b 005 B 004 a  b 004 6 and 004Ä\004 is a norm on the points of A and B e.g.the L 2 or Euclidean distance between a and b  The function h  A  B  is called the Directed Hausdorff Distance DHD from A to B  It is noticed that the function 5 is not symmetrical it cannot thus be a distance with the metric direction However it is used much to measure a degree of similarity between two contours A and B Symmetry is usually restored by taking the maximum between h\(A B and h\(B A Then we obtain the de\036nition of the undirected or classic Hausdorff distance CHD H  A  B  max  h  A  B   h  B  A  7 H  A  B  max  max a 005 A d  a  B   max b 005 B d  b  A  8 The Hausdorff distance CHD H  A  B  is the maximum of h  A  B  and h  B  A   Thus it measures the degree of mistmatch between two sets by measuring the distance of the point of A that the farthest from any point of B and vice versa 2.2.2 Modiﬁed Hausdorff distances There is a great number of alternatives to the preceding de\036nitions which give better results shown in the 036eld of the recognition of form and the imagery In the case of the detection of anomalies the authors are not informed of work using the distances from Hausdorff classic or modi\036ed distance There are thus various ways of calculating Directed Hausdorff Distances DHD 4 Mo reo v e r  undirected Hausdorff distances can be also modi\036ed 5  By combining directed and undirected Hausdorff distances one obtains a great number of alternatives  Undirected Hausdorff distance alternatives H 1  A  B  min  h  A  B   h  B  A  9 H 2  A  B  max  h  A  B   h  B  A  10 H 3  A  B  h  A  B  h  B  A  2 11

Expression yields true, and a False Stencil which is selected when the Conditional Expression yields false A sample Stencil is shown in Figure 6 and described in section 4.3 The AAP phase uses the token list of the document to resolve the Stencil, by resolv ing the elements in the Stencil in order. String elements are directly emitted to the output. Future Expressions are evaluated, the result of which then converted to String and sent to the output. For each Branch element, depending on the evaluation result of its Conditional Expression, either the True Stencil or the False Stencil is selected and recursively resolved Note that Future Expressions can only take document token list as input and doesnít have access to XSLT variables. As a result, if an expression depends on an XSL variable whose value canít be determined at PreP phase \(because its value is conditionally updated by a conditional element\no transformation optimization for this combination of stylesheet and structure 3.3.5 Compression for Efficient Transmission Efficient transmission of XML documents is particularly important in mobile environments Structure recurrence can be exploited for compression and efficient transmission by avoiding the redundant transmission of structural information and by compressing recurring test nodes and attribute values  Assuming sender S first sends document A to receiver R and later sends to R document B which has the same structure as document A, if S knows that R has locally kept the structure information for A, then S only needs to send the structure identification of B, along with the text node and attribute values of B. Efficiency is achieved by replacing the structure of document B with the \(much shorter\identification of the structure of the document  Further, the text node and attribute values in document A has a 1-to-1 mapping with those in document B. If sender S is aware that receiver R also keeps text node and attribute values of document A, then when S detects that a value in B is the same as the corresponding value in A, S only needs to signal R to reuse the value in A, instead of retransmitting it The combination of the two offers potentially high compression ratio with very low computation overhead Note that it is not necessary for the sender and the receiver to be both aware of the existence of the compression. For example, in wireless mobile environments, the gateway of a mobile device can serve as the proxy between the outside world and the mobile device: XML documents are transmitted in compressed form between a mobile device and its gateway, while the gate way and the outside world communicate in usual text form 4 IMPLEMENTATION We have implemented in Java a XML tokenizer, a DOM-style parser, and a XSLT processor, based on Structure Encoding. The DOM-style parser is implemented as an exten sion to kXML, while the XSLT processor is implemented as an extension to XT 4.1 Tokenizer The tokenizer operates in three different modes  The Swift mode, which is activated when the incoming document contains sender assigned structure ID, and that cached token list for the structure is found  The Hash mode, which is activated when the incoming document does not contain sender assigned structure ID The hash function we use is an implementation of MD5 which generates 128-bit digests  The Nature mode, which is normal XML tokenization and is activated under all other conditions Fi g ure 6. An Exam p le of Transformation Stencil

Under Swift mode, the tokenizer checks each token in the token list, and takes different action depending on the types of the token  If it is a Text token, it reads a text string \(delimited by and may contain entity references\ the document character stream, and uses the text string to replace the value of the token  If it is a Start Element token, the tokenizer first skips a number of characters from the document character stream. The exact number of characters is determined by the length of the name of the element. It then enters a loop that reads attributes of the element. Within the body of the loop, it first checks if the next token is Attribute Name. If it is not, then the processing for the Start Element token completes. Otherwise, it skips the name of the attributes, reads the value of the attribute and updates the value of the next token \(which must be of type Attribute Value  In all other cases, the tokenizer simply skips a number of characters. The exact number of characters is determined by the type of the token and the length of the value of the token In the Nature mode, the tokenizer reads in XML constructs, makes sure that they are syntactically correct, and then converts them into tokens. Operations in Hash mode are mostly the same, except that the tokenizer also needs to send structure characters to the hash function for ID generation 4.2 Structure Encoding Based Parser Figure 7 shows a structure encoding based XML parser. It has three components: The Tokenizer as described above  The Structure Manager, which contains a cache manager that manages the reuse of document trees, and an optional Structure Optimizer, which does tree optimizations described in section 3.3.3  The Controller, which includes an interface with the kXML DOM parser. It also includes a Value Loader which does text node and attribute value reassignments The Controller falls back to kXML DOM parser, by passing to it a SAX parser implemented on top of the tokenizer, when it is unable to get a reusable document tree from the Structure Manager. Each document structure has a mapping table that associates a text node or an attribute value object with a token in the token list. The Value Loader in the Controller uses this mapping table to quickly grab text or attribute values from incoming documentís token list, and reassigns them to corresponding text node or attribute value objects. Figure 8 illustrates using Structure Encoding based parser to parse the book record document shown in Figure 1 4.3 Structure Encoding Based Transformer Figure 9 shows the components of a Structure Encoding based transformer hosted in the XT XSLT processor. Of its four components, the tokenizer and the Structure Manager are the same as in the parser The two different components are the Pre-processor and the Transformation controller Pre-processor carries out the PreP phase of structure encoding based transformation using stylesheet and document structure to generate transformation Stencil Within the document structu re, the text and attribute nodes are changed to objects of a special type, which upon access, throws a special exception which uses an integer index to indicate which text node or attribute is accessed. The structure is then treated as a regular document and fed to XT along with the stylesheet. We have also extended XT, so that any expression that may catch the above-mentioned special exception is extended into a Future Expression, which can be evaluated by taking only t oken list as input. A Future Expression in turn throws itself as a special exception which is then either caught by another Future Expression or, eventually, by an action. An action generates a result segment, which can be one of the following  A string, in the case when there is no special exception caught  A Future Expression, when one or more special exceptions are caught, and  A Branch, when the action is an IfAction generated from an xsl:if or xsl:choose XSL element.The Stencil Resolver in the Transformation Controller is called in the AAP phase after the source document arrives and a transformation is requested. It retrieves the Stencil using the stylesheet and the document structure as key, then uses the token list for the source document as input to Figure 7. A Structure Encod ing Based XML Parser

solve the Stencil, using methods described in section 3.3.4 Figure 10 shows a simple XSL stylesheet used to convert the book record document shown in Figure 1 into HTML format. Note th at it contains an xsl:if element, which tests if the ìspecialî price is greater than zero, and if the condition is true, it outputs an onsale price. Figure 11 shows the result of the transformation Figure 6 shows the Stencil generated by the PreP phase, where i  i th entry in the mapping ta ble \(see section 4.2 Stencilî contains a Branch, which has a ìGreaterThan Number Relationî that canít be pre-evaluated, as it depends on the number value of a Text or Attribute Value token.

The sender and receiver both maintain an encoding table Each entry of the table is a mapping from a structure ID to a cached document structure as well as a list of template values for attr ibutes and text nodes associated Figure 8  Example of Structure Encoding Based Figure 9.

5 EVALUATION Evaluation experiments described in this section are conducted on a TI OMAP 1511 Innovator device which runs in frequencies up to 200MHz. It has 32MB ROM as well as 32MB RAM. The OS used is a version of embedded Linux, and the JVM used is Intent from TAO Group The source documents and stylesheets used for evaluation are randomly selected from Sarvegaís XSLTBench and DataPowerís XSLTMark [17  after initially excluding some unrealistic transformations. We select these two benchmarks as they are influential indust ry benchmark and that they both support XSLT benchmarking. Note that some of the large source documents are less likely to have recurrent structures in real-world applications. We included them regardless as they might help us understand the implication of document size on system performance. Table 1 lists sizes of sample documents and the transformation stylesheets used for them. Table 2 lists the raw numbers used in following discussions Documents are fully read into memory before any measurement starts to minimize external disturbance Warm-up runs are always conducted prior to real measurement runs 5.1 Tokenization Figure 12 compares the speed of Swift mode and Hash mode against the speed of Nature mode tokenization The Swift mode is by far the fasted, having a median speedup of 2.40 over Nature mode. The median speed of Hash mode is about 81% of that of Nature mode which means a median hashing overhead of about 23.5%. In the worst case, this overhead is about 37.4 for wai  5.2 DOM-style Parsing Figure 13 and Figure 14 compare speed of Structure Encoding based parsing against that of kXML parsing for both Receiver ID Assigning and Sender ID Assigning. In Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while in Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses Swift mode when cache hit ratio is 100% \(i.e., structure of incoming document is always in cache\ode when cache hit ratio is 0 Figure 13 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed is 4.34 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 1.35 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is in backwords and game which use the same source document\to 8 under Sender ID Assigning Figure 14 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 1.07 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.90 \(or an overhead of %11.1\ID Assigning is used. The worst sample is wai where the overhead is about 20.5% under Receiver ID Assigning. The reason Figure 12. Comparing Performance of Tokenization Modes Figure 14.

that Structure Encoding is a little faster than kXML even when cache hit ratio is 0 is likely because of the fact that, while we use kXML for tree building, we modified it slightly to interface it with our tokenizer which resulted in differences in execution traces and slight differences in runtime performance when execute in JVM Overall, these two figures demonstrate that Structure Encoding based parsing provides substantial speedup when structure recurrence is frequent, and incurs low overhead when such recurrence is rare 5.3 Transformation Similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare transformation speed of Structure Encoding based XSL processor against that of XT for both Sender ID Assigning and Receiver ID Assigning. Again, under Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while under Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses either Swift mode or Nature mode Figure 15 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed of Structure Encoding based implem entation is 5.38 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 2.72 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is trend  where the relative speed is over 39 for Sender ID Assigning, and over 25 for Receiver ID assigning Figure 16 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 0.996 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.918 or an overhead of 8.9 is used. The worst sample is nitf-stylized where the overhead is about 14.6% under Receiver ID Assigning These two figures show that Structure Encoding based XSL processing offers even higher potential speedup than parsing, yet incurs lower overhead in worst cases This is understandable as, typi cally, a large portion of operations in transformation is for costly structurerelated operations, which we have pre-processed offline. Note that, as long as structure recurrence is frequent, the potential improvement is very high \(up to a median relative speed of 2.72\even if the receiver has to calculate structure ID through hashing 5.4 Compression We conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of Structure Encoding based compression. In the experiment, for each sample document, we randomly changed the values of 3 rd 8 th  13 th i.e., one in every 5, starting from the 3 rd  attribute and text node values. Thus our experiment Figure 16. Comparing Structu re Encoding Based Transformation and XT  Cache Hit Ratio 0  Figure 15.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didnít measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
