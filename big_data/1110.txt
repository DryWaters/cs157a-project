 AbstractThe enterprises which provide express delivery services must have high regard for customer and offer good services to improve the customer service level. As a newly thought of marketing, cross-selling can improve the economic benefits of enterprises and strengthen the relation between enterprise and customer. The model of cross-selling of express delivery business is established by using two data mining algorithms, association rule abst racting algorithm and decision tree classification algorithm, which are used in cross-selling analysis. The actual experiment is done, and the result shows the methods are effecting for express delivery business Key Words Data mining, Express delivery business Cross-selling 
I  INTRODUCTION  Cross-selling" has become a popular word for some years It can be dated back to 1965, in some overseas related references [1 sssell in g alr eady has  b een us ed widely in overseas banking. But research on theory and practice of cross-selling has increases until 2000 The cross-selling is a marketing strategy which is based on existing relation between enterprise and customers and offer another product or service. A lot of researches indicate that attracting a new customer's expenses is much higher than benefit that an old customer produces. When an original customer maintains for five years, their purchase presents a 
tendency of increasing rapidly, from 10% of customers buying a product to 80% of customers buying more than three products. In the course of cross-selling, the customers will not regard the products and services which enterprise offer as the pure trade briefly, but often think about other factors of various types of human relationship such as friendship mutual affection and respect, and they are likely to pay more for them. Here virtually, the cross-selling has not merely increased the profits of enterprises, but also promoted corporate image, fostered customers' loyalty, and formed the important sustainable development strategy of enterprise Express delivery" is developing fast in every large city of the whole country in recent years. The Express delivery such 
as flower present, ticket, postcard, ID card, passport, legal document, driving license, medical document, tax newspaper etc., causes people's warm response from putting out. This style of living that is buying time and disposing resource rationally has been accepted by more and more people With the enormous flourishing economy of China and the development of the express delivery’s demand and potentiality, big international companies accelerate to deal in express delivery industry in Chinese market obviously. Show according to some materials [2  th e in t er n at io nal ex pr ess delivery macro company occupies 60% of the market in China. Compete among the express delivery enterprises will 
stronger. If enterprises want to catch the rich and generous market in keen competition, they must carry out a lot of effective selling thoughts and skills, for instance, Internet sale, relationship sale, intelligence sale. At the same time cross-selling can offer the intact solution to enterprise's customers; it also can explore the customers' value during the process of keeping profitability and solve the contradiction between customers' long-term interests and existing interests So cross-selling becomes an effective way for the express delivery enterprises cultivate the new profit increasing point  of enterprise In the field of logistics express delivery in China 
031 there is little study and application on cross-selling. How to apply cross-selling in the express delivery industry was studied in this paper. It is studied about the role of cross-selling for increasing profits and promoting image of express delivery enterprises, cultivating faithfulness of customers; and how to drive the sustainable development of express delivery enterprises It is shown in related researches and practices at home and abroad, that cross-selling is applied widely in finance and then is applied in retailing and telecommunication. Some advantages of cross-selling will be used in the field of logistics express delivery Rudolf Felix published his paper "FODM-9: Fuzzy 
decision making with interaction goals applied to cross-selling decisions in the field of private customer banking" [3 o n th e 10 th I EEE I n tern ation al Co n fer ence in  2001. In his paper, a model of interactions between goals based on fuzzy relations is presented. In contrast other approaches in multiple attribute decision making, the interactive structure of goals for each decision situation is represented and modeled explicitly. As an example of a real world application, a system for sales assistance in cross-selling situation is presented. In the paper "Genetic Algorithm for Item Selection with Cross-selling Considerations  Ya n C he ng poi nt e d out t ha t a  fundamental problem in chain convenience store is selecting 
items with respect to notion of "cross-selling effect". In her paper, Genetic algorithm is applied to this problem. Based on the features of Genetic algorithm, a method of defining imprecise fitness function is proposed which is suited for solving item selection with imprecision cross-selling effect Research on Cross-se lling in the Express De livery Enterprise Based on Data Mining Jingyun Huang,   Shouwen Ji,   Haiyao Xie,   Xiaohua Wang   Transportation School of Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100044 China hjyyun@gmail.com 


Quantitative analysis method on "cross-selling effect" is also presented in this paper, which employs the ideas of quantitative association rules, a recent data mining technique to discover quantitative affinities in large transaction databases  On Proceedings of ICSSSM '05 conference, Wei Lv etc. presented a cross-selling model of retail bank  As  the opening of Retail Banks and severe competition among them in China, construction and management of cross-selling model based on data mining in Retail banks have been placed increasing emphases on. What is expounded in their paper is how to identify opportunities of cross selling with application of data mining in retail banks in the light of practical case Pang Jie etc. [6 p r o pos e d a m o de l i n g m e t ho d of da t a m i ni n g technology, and study on a application plan of data mining technology that is used in how carries on the cross-selling to the telecommunication customer, so as to raise the core competitive power II  THE THEORETICAL BASIS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF CROSS-SELLING ANALYSIS A  Cross-selling & relationship marketing Relationship marketing focuses on the development and maintenance of genuine customers, who are realized to accept and perceive the value, having the possibility to purchase the extra service and no possibility to transform to competitors. The problem on how can "relationship marketing" improve customer loyalty and increase organization's profit is also more and more studied by the researchers. In these researches, relationship marketing depends on such a premise that with the passage of time more contact between the logistics enterprises and customers, opportunities on the mutual interest of the strong partnership between the development of logistics enterprises and customers will come out. Therefore, the existing customer value of maintaining and developing relationships with is gradually focused on by enterprises With the rapid development of information technology cross-selling is considered as a primary tool for CRM to consolidate customer relationship. Thus, relationship marketing is the theoretical basis of cross-selling and cross-selling is an important tool to implement  relationship marketing B  Cross-selling & customer profitability Customer profitability is considered as a key standard to judge whether the existing customers is worthwhile to carry out cross-selling by enterprises. If the cross-selling is not established on the basis of analyzing customer profitability, it may lead to a result which opposites the business goals Cross-selling is not suitable for all customers, so it is necessary to identify and analyze customers. Andrew [7 who pointed out that, "it is very important for cross-selling to identify the profitable segment market." Thus, it is necessary for  implementing cross-selling to analyze the customer profitability   Some researchers confirm that, if the connection between cross-selling and the analysis of customer profitability didn't get more closely, cross-selling may actually be harmful, that means to bring the enterprise unprofitable or the more negative profit customers' sales the more corporate profits losses. As a result, customer profitability is a key to cross-selling [7 C  Effect of information technology on cross-selling As mentioned above, due to the development of information technology, many companies have implemented CRM. Cross-selling, as one of the CRM tools, is also becoming more and more popular. Cross-selling is becoming a tool, which uses the information technology to analyze customers purchasing habits and change marketing strategy Some enterprises have been in the process of collection and storage of a variety of customer data in the provision of goods and services, but CRM is also used to establish a huge data warehouse to store and process data, and turn them into useful information for enterprises Nevertheless, the development of the data storage technology is much faster than the development of finding knowledge and technology fr om data. Therefore, how to carry on data mining in the data warehouse has gradually become the most core part in CRM Data mining analyze a large number of data automatically to identify the patterns or trends from the primary information which is not clear. These patterns and trends can help to make correct judgments. Data mining can help companies analyze the optimal matching reasonable sales; the enterprise can not only get an increase in sales, but also improve customer satisfaction, set up long-term customer service relations III  CROSS-SELLING ANALYSIS OF THE EXPRESS DELIVERY BUSINESS BASED ON DATA MINING A  Data mining technology With rapid development of information technology especially the widespread application of the database technology and the computer network, the database scale expands unceasingly, and the data of enterprises has been increasing rapidly. In order to provide a unified and overall perspective  to policy maker, the data warehouse has been built in many domains. However, mass data which can provide support for the decision-making in the data warehouse often hide in the data which is unable to be distinguished. The traditional inquiry and report tool is unable to satisfy the demand of excavating this information therefore a new data analysis technology is needed for processing mass data and excavating the valuable latent information. Then the data mining technology emerge as the times require Data mining is defined as the exploration and analysis in order to discover meaningful knowledge of large quantities of data which is deposited in the database, data warehouse or other database [8  So m e c o nno t a t i v e va l u a b l e a nd intelligible information which is used to direct people's activity, is extracting from large quantities of data. Data mining technologies mainly include association rule, artificial neural networks, memory inference, cluster analysis 


decision-tree method and sequential pattern etc. Along with rapid development of information science, database, artificial intelligence and mathematical statistic have become three big technology supports in the research on data mining. The generic step for the process of data mining is shown as follow a  Confirming business object b  Data pretreatment \(Data selection 001 Data integration 001  Data conversion c  Data mining d  Analysis and evaluation of mining result A typical data mining system includes function modules as follow: databases, data warehoused, knowledge library data mining engine, data access interface, miner models and visualized user interface. Its structure is shown in Fig 1  Fig 1 Structure of data mining system  B  Foundation of the cross-selling in the express delivery business The cross-selling analysis means that association analysis in the existing customer's purchase behavior data is carried on by utilizing association rule, which is one of the data mining technologies, and finally finds the opportunities of the cross-selling and upgrade-selling, in order to offer better services to customers [9 The cross-selling analysis must obey the international circulation methodology of the data mining. Standard CRISP-DM illustrated in Fig. 2 \(Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining\10 i s o ne k i nd of a c kno wl e d ge d and more influential data mining methodology. CRISP-DM emphasizes that the data mining is not merely the organization or appearance of data, but also the data analysis and counting model, it is a complete process  from understanding the business demand and seeking the solution to accepting the intact course examined in practice The foundation on which the modern express delivery enterprises' data mining has already possessed a. A large amount of historical data: enterprise's business has accumulated a large amount of historical data, which offers a good quality foundation for the data mining b. Use of the extensive computer: make sure that the data source of dealing data mining updates in time everyday c. The varied data mining algorithms: the companies, such as SAS/SPSS/IBM, etc. have offered the ripe commercial data mining software package  Fig 2 Standard CRISP-DM C  Problem description The cross-selling analysis excavates the association rule from the sale data of the enterprise, analyze the consume custom of the customer, find the service frequently used by customers at the same time and finally put them into cross-selling The associated and regular concept was proposed in 1993 by Agrawal of U.S.A. IBM Almaden Research Center, etc 1 a k i nd o f sim p le and pr acti cal ru le i n date m i n i ng Th e association rule finds an interesting relevant connection between sets from a large amount of business affairs Agrawal has proposed famous Apriori algorithm, this algorithm is the key algorithm in the association rule mining Its basic thought is: first, through scanning the database, get a big candidate-data collection, calculate the times of happening of each candidate-data, then on the basis of the minimum support-degree definite in advance generate enormous one-dimension data-set named L 1 then basing on L1 and database, generate a two-dimension data-set called L 2  use the same method, until get the N-dimension date-set called L N they can not generate N+1-dimension data-sets which satisfy the minimum support-degree among L N So it generates data-sets {L 1 L 2 L N finally work out the rule    Apriori algorithm needs to scan database many times in the course of data mining. While dealing with a large number of data, obviously, the efficiency of Apriori algorithm is not high. At the same time, in the course of dealing with the business data of enterprises, the rule may be stored on different levels in the database. If we also consider the concepts of some abstract levels, may find new rules. So according concrete demand characteristic of cross-selling analysis, multi-level association rule algorithm has been adopted to excavate on differ ent abstract levels in the database D  Data preparation The information such as user transaction information commodity information and user personal information is the original data source which has relation to the cross-selling 


analysis. The data about the mother day in the China Railway Express Enterprise are used in the experiment China Railway Express Company \(CRE for short\ is found in 1993. Its primary business is baggage and parcel express by railway. CRE provides express delivery service from door to door, and provides air-rail intermodality and rail-sea intermodality at the same time. The domestic network of CRE which forms a chain service network has spread to large and medium cities in China including Hong Kong. CRE is able to manage national express delivery business for some nations The project sold the follow service across such as flower express delivery, gift express delivery and card express delivery in order to improve the marketing efficiency increase the business income and strengthen the care between enterprise and customer. The flower includes different bouquet and basket, the gift includes the cosmetic, health care and food etc. If the customer purchases these products in the express delivery company, the company will send free or decide the different preferential way of deliver according the number of the money the customer has spent in the company The customer data is chosen from the business transaction data of the 2006 mother’s day. The number of transaction record is 3120; the transaction data includes 36 original variables and 12 conversions variables Table 1 Input variable of cross-selling analysis model  Before setting up the intersection sale analysis mode, the incomplete data is coped firstly, and the record data should be converted into operation data. The association rule mining is for operation data and the sale data of enterprise is recorded in the form of record, so the sale data of enterprise should be converted into operation data E  The foundation of cross-selling analysis model The cross-selling analysis of service operation is affected not only by the business logic of service operation but also by many kinds of sensibility factors such as customers occupation, age, economic capacity, life custom, personal experience and the psychology of accepting service. Because many factors affecting the relation among the operation project have been reflected when customer purchase and use product, if the data in the database about the customer's purchasing and using activity recorded by enterprise is analyzed by using cross-selling analysis, and the model is founded, the association between product and customer and the association between product and product can be concluded completely. If the association rule is applied directly to the market activity and customer service work, it will help the enterprise to set up loyal customer relationship Two arithmetics are adopted in cross-selling analysis model 017p association rule arithmetic of multilevel excavating from different abstract level in the database 017q decision tree classification arithmetic. The first arithmetic is used to analyze the relationship among the operation project, find the association rule between project and project from the exiting customer purchase, and help the enterprise find the chance to corporate the service project or bindle the sale. The second arithmetic is used to find the customer group using single service project, in order to know the high possibility customer and low possibility customer in the service project and make the customer list preparing for the sale personnel to promote product 1\ Analysis of the association of the service item The multi-layer association rule algorithm basing on the multi-layer association rule algorithm is used mainly for getting the high-level one, not having misleading, irredundant multi-level association rule. The multi-level association rule is divided into two kinds. The first kind happens on the same concept level, X 004\010 Y, X and Y are the same concept level another kind happens on different concept levels, X 004\010 Y, X and Y belong to different concept levels. To X 004 I, Y 004 I, the support grade of regular S 031 X 004\010 Y 031 000 S min it is called that regular X 004\010 Y is a frequent rule The multi-level association rule algorithm thought of the concept level tree is: trade database TDB, concept level tree minimum support degree S min and minimum credibility C min  are used as input; the multi-level association rule according with minimum support degree S min and minimum credibility C min are used as output The realization steps of algorithm are showed as follow 017p 000\002 Encode each node of the concept level tree preserving a node that can make up the frequent rule while excavating in PTtree, namely the node making up priori and estimating 017q 000\002 Sample, store it for DB' separately 017r 000\002 Calculate frequent collections in concept level tree PTree'. According to frequent collections, test whether the node in PTree can make up the frequent rule and join organized in PTree Name of variable Value of variable customer sex m ale f emale customer age 15 032 45 customer vocation students, staff customer monthly income 0 032 more than 10000 customer service area science and technology park , culture region r esidence area customer scale individual, croup flower express class A,  class B,  class C,  class D audiovisual book express life, literature, medicine and health health product express gen-seng series cosmetic express brand Olay , brand Maybelline postcard express postcard etiquette remittance remittance 


017s 000\002 To leaf-node X in PTree, if it appears in PTree expand X to nodal X 1 X 2 X n test whether X 1  X 2 X n could make up the frequent rule. When X i can be all right, join it in PTree', and expand it the circulation is downward. The nodes in PTree and root nodes make up new PTree 017t 000\002 While DB' <DB 017u 000\002 To the node in PTree', select the collection-rule named c_rules after calculating. Check the rule’s support degree and credibility in the c_rules, delete the rule of support degree and credibility that are below setting value, and then get the c-rules 017v 000\002 Purify the c-rules; delete the redundant and invalid rules 017w 000\002 Output c-rules               Fig.3. Data flow of modeling and model evaluation Some tools of the Clementine8.0 are used in the experiment, such as service tools of analysis, in order to realize the function of algorithm in its self-defining algorithm interface 2\ Customer classification based on decision-tree  The decision-tree is a tree structure similar to the flow chart, each inside node among them expresses the test on an attribute variable, each branch represents test-output, each leaf-node represents classificat ion, and the top-node on the tree is the root-node [8  T o t he u nkn own s a m pl e  classification, the attribute variable of the sample is tested by using inside nodes on the decision-tree. When the categorizing rules are drawn from judging-trees, a rule is constructed for each path from root to leaves. Each attribute variable-value-pair along the giving path makes up the front part of the rule \(the part "I F"\he leaf-nodes classification forms the back part of the rule \(the part "THEN Considering the commercial view, the decision-tree can be regarded as the division of primary data \(each division must be the leaf of tree\. The division is based on some specific reason. The tree structure and generating rule of decision-tree are very simple; moreover it is easy to translate the decision-tree model to SQL form which can be shown in the relational database. So it is proposed that decision-tree technology is applied in the customer analysis, to the key aspect of determination C&R Tree decision tree algorithm is adopted. The first step is to utilize training set to set up and evolve on a decision tree in order to establish the decision tree model. Actually it is a way to obtain knowledge from the datum, carry on the course of machine study. The second step is to utilize the decision tree produced to classify the real data. Choosing 10600 effective data, divide them in to two parts, 7067 records are used for producing the decision tree, and the other 3533 are used for testing the decision tree which is produced F  Result of data mining 1\ Result and analysis of association rule mining Table 2 shows a multi-level association rule of the related regular algorithm  Table2 Multi-level association rules representation Six relative rules are resulted from table 2, at the same time the association among four kinds of services is reflected. The first rule is if customer buys flower express delivery, the possibility of buying postcard express delivery is 45%; its confidence is 90%. That is to say, there are 45% customers who buy both flower express delivery and postcard express delivery; and among the customers who buy flower express delivery, there are 90% customers buy greeting card express delivery. Other regulars are similar. In the demonstration, the classification of service items is rough. At practical application, it is more practical which divide in details, for example, "customer express delivery flowers for 'thank mother 015 the customer will also buy an express delivery card", ect 2\ Result of customer classification based on decision-tree Customer age, customer vocation and monthly income are used as decision index of decision-tree model. The final decision-tree for classifying customer group is returned by training and testing the decision-tree model, and the result of the classification of customer is come out. It is shown in fig 4 S stands for students; Y stands for young people whose income is not high; C stands for customer group whose income is high Serial    Regulation         Sport degree  Reliability degree 01   flower 015 card                    S=45%          C=90 02   flower 015 health products   S=42%          C=83 03   flower 015 cosmetic              S=40%         C=81 04   card 015 cosmetic                S=41%          C=75 05   card 015 health products      S=30%          C=66 06   health products 015 cosmetic S=26%          C=55 


 Fig 4 Decision-tree model of customer group classification The final decision-tree which is shown in Fig 4 also can be used to express implicated knowledge by using IF-THEN form. Along with the route that starts with root node and end in the final leaf node, the decision rule is extracted as follow IF 15 000 Age 000 30 AND Vocation = Student THEN S IF 15 000 Age 000 30 AND Vocation = Staff AND 600 000 Monthly income 000 3500 THEN Y IF 15 000 Age 000 30 AND Vocation = Staff AND 3500 000 Monthly income THEN C IF 30 000 Age 000 45 AND Vocation = Student THEN S IF 30 000 Age 000 45 AND Vocation = Staff AND 600 000 Monthly income 000 3500 THEN Y IF 30 000 Age 000 45 AND Vocation = Staff AND 3500 000 Monthly income THEN C It is shown in Fig 4 that China Railway Express' customers are classified into three groups. That is on Mother's Day, the business mainly concentrate on customers with higher income group, youth whose income is not very high and students. The express delivery service for flower presents health products and cosmetic is adopted mainly by a high income crowd. Youth often choose to the express delivery service for flower presents, and students often choose the Mother's Day special-purpose postcard express service  3\ Sales Strategies for China Railway Express Association analysis and customer classification is carried on by using two kinds of data mining technologies association rule and decision-tree analysis method According to the result which is given above, some sales strategies are presented for China Railway Express Enterprise in order to promote customer consumption, improve customer satisfaction, increase enterprise sales volume and set up long-term customer relationship 017p 000\002 Pay attention to customer information collection and data analysis, mining association of service and products, and realize customer group classification 017q 000\002 Provide different express delivery services to different customer groups. For example, on Mother's Day, the express delivery service of fresh flowers, cosmetic and health products is mainly provided for customers with higher income, they are the primary sales object. And the express delivery service of flowers, postcards is mainly provided for young people and students 017r 000\002 Drive cross-selling's application in China Railway Express with the association of service and products For example, if customers buy the express delivery postcard on Mother's Day, their mothers can receive the carnation flowers which represent customers compliment; if customers choose health products express delivery service, flowers express delivery service will be free for them These strategies can be used to promote sales. It not only improves the efficiency of selling, but also reflects the real value of data mining  IV  CONCLUSION For the express delivery companies carrying on cross-selling, the modern data mining technology offered a convenient technological tool which easily obtains customer's information. Cross-selling launching the popularization of pertinence can reduce the expenses on customer contacting improve the customer service level, and respond the platform of customer's demand in real time REFERENCE   ans i, L   Sargeant, A  2 0 00 Market segmentation in the Indonesian banking sector: the relation ship between demographics and desired customer benefits.

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
