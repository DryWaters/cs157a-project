Fig 1 Distribution of reposts number over 24 hours repost number as this part We get 100 microblogs in all denoted as OFFLIST100  Ordinary microblogs whose owner has one or more microblogs in the ranking list For those users who have one or more microblogs in the ranking list we choose their 100 recent microblogs Filter out those microblogs that have been in the ranking list and those with reposts number larger than 7000 and smaller than 5000 At last we have 471 microblogs as this part and it is denoted as OFFLIST471 The second and third parts are separately the hot and ordinary microblogs which are not in the ranking list So they can be used as the representative of the microblogs that are not in the ranking list At last for all the microblogs we use Sina Weibo Open API to fetch all of their reposts And we get more than 12 million reposts B Data analysis 1 Distribution of reposts over 24 hour We calculate the distribution of reposts over 24 hours in one day for the three parts of our dataset Then they are normalized by being divided with the total number of reposts of relevant part Figure 1 shows that for those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 they have two peaks around 9:00 and 22:00 separately However those in ONLIST461 have their reposts number more averagely distributed The microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 are ordinary microblogs and reposted mainly through the friends network So their frequency can be on half of the distribution of one ordinary microblogs It shows the inîuence of time in one day on the repost action One obvious result is that more reposts appear in the daytime than at night In more detail at 9:00 it is the time that people begin one dayês work They tend to check their microblogs And at 22:00 it is the time before bedtime People check their microblogs to relax So in these moments it is more possible for an repost to appear However those microblogs in ONLIST461 are more exposed since they are in the ranking list At other time people have more ways to have access to it and so they have larger parts of reposts than those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 Regarding this frequency as the correction factor we can reduce the inîuence of time in one day on the distribution and TABLE I The correction factor  for 24 hours  hour 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1.53 2.91 5.15 7.61 9.27 8.66 4.81 2.48 hour 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  1.59 1.21 1.32 1.50 1.47 1.42 1.67 1.73 hour 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  1.81 1.64 1.59 1.53 1.30 1.10 1.00 1.18 Fig 2 Distribution of corrected repost number onlist461h x means x h  T  x 2 h get closer to the nature of the Matthew Effect Speciìcally we correct the repost number using the following method Let RC i  i 0  1  2  23  be the repost number of those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 in hour i  Then the correction factor  i  max RC i  RC i  And the corrected repost number of microblog with original repost number RC is RC   i  The correction factors are shown in Table I 2 Distribution of corrected repost number of hot microblogs For every microblog in ONLIST461 we calculate the interval T between the time when this microblog enters the ranking list and its create time Divide those microblogs into 12 categories every two hours of T from 0h to 24h since the ranking list is of the recent 24 hours there is no microblogs with T 24 hours Consider the corrected repost number of the microblogs in different categories Figure 2 shows that after a few miniutes the time when entering the ranking list the microblogs have an obvious increase in the corrected repost number per 10 minutes which means that the event of entering ranking list would bring more reposts to them to make them hotter When a new microblog enters the ranking list since many people have not seen it yet it is likely to have the largest repost number per 10 minutes These microblogs enter the ranking list because they have large amounts of reposts And in return being in the ranking list gives them larger repost number per unit time Another point is that repost number per 10 minutes of these hot microblogs all decline sharply at about 24 hours after they enter the list This is because the list is dynamically updated to ensure the microblogs in the list is the hot microblogs of recent 24 hours And after 24 hours the microblogs are pushed off the list and deprived of the privilege of being more exposed So being in the list brings more reposts than not 42 


Fig 3 Distribution of corrected repost number of the three parts Fig 4 The percentage of the rst-level reposts 3 Distribution of corrected repost number of the three parts The correction by the factors in the subsection II-B1 would help us see the Matthew Effect clearly without the inîuence of the normal period of peopleês life In order to discover the inîuence of being on the ranking list we compare the corrected repost number of the three parts of our dataset Figure 3 shows that about 24 hours after their create time those microblogs in ONLIST461 have sharp declining in their repost number per 10 minutes However this phenomenon is not so obvious for those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and especially OFFLIST471 The reason of this phenomenon is that those microblogs are all from the 24-hour ranking list and after about 24 hours they are pushed off the ranking list and lose their privileges over other ordinary microblogs This proves the great effect of entering the ranking list 4 The percentage of the rst-level reposts The rst-level reposts of a source microblog m are the reposts which repost microblog m directly not those reposts which are the reposts of others Those people who check the ranking list usually discover the source microblogs directly The reposts brought by appearing in the ranking list are mostly rst-level reposts So analysis of rst-level repost is indispensable We deìne the percentage p fl as the percentage of the rst-level reposts of one microblog m over all its reposts In this part we would compare the percentage of the rst-level reposts p fl to see the inîuence of entering the ranking list Figure 4 shows that for those microblogs in OFFLIST471 and OFFLIST100 their p fl generally decline averagely However for those microblogs in ONLIST461 their p fl have an obvious increase when they enter the ranking list and an sharp decline when they are pushed off the ranking list This is because users always directly repost this microblog when they see it in the ranking list and so this part of reposts is mainly rst-level reposts Those users who do not see the microblog in the ranking list mostly repost the reposts of their followees Again this proves that appearing in the ranking list would bring more reposts to make hot microblogs hotter and that is the proof of existence of Matthew Effect III C ONCLUSION This paper mainly studies hot microblogs in the ranking list of Hot Microblog App in Sina Weibo microblogger After removing the inîuence of normal period of peopleês life we nd that microblogs would have an increase in reposts number per unit time when they enter the ranking list and an decline when they are pushed off the list When seeing the microblog in the ranking list of Hot Microblog App users tend to repost it directly And that is the cause of the same variation tendency of ratio of rst-level reposts as the reposts number per unit time We prove the existence of Matthew Effect from different aspects In social network hot topics or microblogs are always recommended to users which in return makes it hotter And that is Matthew Effect IV F UTURE W ORK We studies on Matthew Effect in Sina Weibo microblogger For those microblogs that have been in the ranking list how many percentage of reposts number is brought by Matthew Effect This is problem worth studying We will model the spread of microblogs before they enter the ranking list and after that time On the other hand the dataset now is not so enough and future work will be done on more data A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No 61025005 61129001 61201384 and the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China Grant No.2010CB731406 and Shanghai Key Lab of Digital Media Processing and Transmissions STCSM 12DZ2272600 R EFERENCES  Matthe w E f fect Online A v ailable http://en.wikipedia.or g/wiki Matthew  effect  E Bakshy  J M Hofman W  A Mason and D J W atts Ev eryones an inîuencer quantifying inîuence on twitter in Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining New York NY USA ACM 2011 pp 65C74  F  W u and B A Huberman No v elty and collecti v e attention Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America vol 104 no 45 pp 17 599C17 601 2007  D K empe J Kleinber g and Ev a T ardos Maximizing the spread of inîuence through a social network In KDD 03 Proc of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining New York NY USA 2003 ACM  Hodas N.O Lerman K Ho w V isibility and Di vided Attention Constrain Social Contagion Privacy Security Risk and Trust PASSAT 2012 International Conference on and 2012 International Confernece on Social Computing SocialCom  vol no pp.249,257 3-5 Sept 2012 43

distances and the proposed algorithm of this paper based on Connected Components algorithm In both images the laser is located in the position which is represented by a triangle As we can appreciate a presents some artifacts like dividing some object that should not be divided or by joining other that should be sparse In contrast we can see in b how our algorithm do not divide the object that are clearly just one object while it can separate in a better way those objects that are not connected position In the image a we can see how this algorithm has the problem that divides the long surfaces like in the right wall into different clusters while in b this the effect is not as pronounced can run with an complexity The pseudo-code of our Connected Components algorithm is give in 1 Due to the fact that we have a list of points we can bypass the grid scanning and directly jump into labeling Hence just taking the rst point of our list of points or just by choosing one randomly we can start to label By taking a bin that is activated and occupied we assign the current label to all of the points that fall into that bin Then we deactivate it and begin to expand the labeling process to the neighbor bins in a 4-connected or 8-connected version When there are no activated bins left to expand we will increase the label by choosing a point that has not being labeled yet then the previous process in repeated until all the points are labeled The above-descried algorithm runs in a linear time due to the fact that we know the locations of all the points in the grid from the beginning so we achieved on average a rate of 238 segmentations per second The gure 4 shows the data structures that we is used in the implementation In order to make it fast and efìcient in memory we are handling 4 data

position and it is represented by a triangle structures at once The rst data structure is the raw input data from the LIDAR represented by red the red color This array contains all the points from the LIDAR sorted from to  This gives us a rigid data structure that will deìne the size of the output The second data structure is a list that contains all the points This structure is just a linked list that points into the occupancy grid Each bin in the grid is a data structure that points to the elements  plus can hold two states activated or deactivated These two states allow us to avoid the labeling the points that has been already labeled Therefore the relationship between and the map is bidirectional In contrast the relationship between and is in one direction as is not modiìed or accessed again IV E XPERIMENTS This section devoted to experimental analysis of the proposed algorithm We analyze the quality of the proposed algorithm by comparing segmentation results with the above-described algorithms The labeling obtained for the data extracted indoors and outdoors In both experimental setups we used a Sick lms511 pro device that provides a maximum of 1141 points for a single scan and runs at 25Hz The algorithm was running on the Intel Core i7-3820 CPU at 3.60GHz The LIDAR device was placed on a table of our lab see image 8 facing various obejcts The scale factor that we used in order to build up the occupancy grid is 10cm The segmentation performance for indoors environment is shown in the gure 5b The point-cloud that is used for labeling is exactly the same as the one shown in the gure 5a It is visually easy to see that our algorithm based on CC has a better capability to properly segment the data into different object that segments that belongs to different objects On the other hand the other method does not separate well some clearly deìned object Comparing the segmentation results obtained by the proposed algorithm gure 6b against the results produced by Fast-RNN algorithm gure 6a it is easy to see how our algorithm preserves the same label even for long and thin objects simultaneously well separating objects that are not connected The purpose of developing our algorithm was to create a method that provides robust and fast laser data segmentation for an autonomous vehicle perception system Therefore in
