Generally, the data used for data mining is heterogeneous, and distributes in the different geography position. This paper focuses on the concept of data mining from multi data source  At last, the research is applied to the clothing teaching, and make a good application effect Keywords-Data mining; Association Rules; Extended Concept Lattice; Algorithm I. INTRODUCTION With the development of information technology, the amount of information which needs storage and communication is growing day by day and the types and forms of information are also becoming increasingly rich Fashion design teaching has also undergone tremendous changes. The development of multimedia technology, the use of various types of clothing design software and the deployment of network teaching platform bring fashion design teaching into a digital age. A great number of fashion design courseware have been stored in different kinds of network courseware databases. Network courseware are the fundamental part of network teaching. The so-called network courseware refers to a piece or a set of digital teaching materials, which integrate teaching design, establish specific courses and implement teaching activities, using the internet as the main communication platform 1  However, due to the lack of information interaction and sharing, the isolated current database system can not predict future development trends based on existing data. The lack of data mining means results in the phenomenon of \223data explosion but knowledge poor\224. Therefore, if association analysis of the current different systems is done, a lot of useful information will be found, such as 200  Analysis of the browsing history of the whole network courseware database and analysis of the association mode of different courseware will help to optimize the layout of the courseware database and improve its efficiency  200  Data mining about attributes such as age and gender of students with excellent academic records will provide guidance for future enrollment and improve the quality of students  200  Data mining about attendance rate and students\222 performance and analysis of the association mode of different courses will help to guide future curriculum In a word, data mining and analysis of the association mode of the above information will certainly help a lot in improving teaching efficiency and quality II. ABOUT DATA MINING A. Concept of Data Mining Data mining is a step in database knowledge discovery which is to extract implicit potential and useful information and knowledge in a large amount of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and random data which people do not know in advance. Data mining which is frequently related to computer science always achieve the goals above through the statistics, online analytical processing, information retrieval, machine learning expert system\( relying on past experience rules\ and pattern recognition 2  B. Task of Data Mining     Data mining\222s task is to discover knowledge from data In practice, we divide data mining into the following three categories according to the use of different modes 3   1 Association Mode. Association mode, also known association rules, reflects the dependence or the associated knowledge between the event and other events. If there is some regularity between the two or more variables, we call it association. Association can be divided into simple 6073 978-1-4244-8165-1/11/$26.00 \2512011 IEEE 


association, temporal association and causal association Association rules can be written as BA A is called the prerequisite B is called the follow-up. Data association is a kind of important knowledge which can be found existed in the database. The purpose of association analysis is to identify the relationship networking hidden in the database Association rules mining are to discover interesting associations or related links between the large amounts of sets of data items The story of \223diapers and beer\224 is a classic case about association rules. Agrawal first proposed the problem that to mine the association rules among the itemsets in the customer transaction database, after which a numbers of researchers do lots of research on the problem of mining association rules Their work included optimizing the original algorithm, such as introducing random sampling and thinking of parallel, to improve the efficiency of mining algorithm and promote the application of association rules  Association rule mining can be divided into two steps first find all frequent sets whose frequency of emergence is at least the same as a predefined minimum support; the second step is to set strong association rules which must satisfy minimum support and confidence by frequent sets. The overall performance of association rule mining determined by the first step while the second step is relatively easy to implement Association rule mining is an important issue in data mining in recent years and has been extensively studied by the industry. This paper will apply data mining to Clothing Teaching, main to find the association rules hidden in the data items 2 Classification Mode. Classification is to analyze a set of classified data objects. Each category of laws is called a class. First, select the classified training sets from the data and build the classification model using data mining techniques to do classification on data that hasn\222t been classified. The main work is to further excavate the intrinsic nature by the different appearances. There are many classification algorithms, such as decision tree, rough set algorithm, Bayesian algorithm, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm, etc  3 Clustering Mode. Clustering is a process that to classify the data objects and to group the similar ones together Data clustering is to divide the data objects into several groups. Objects of each group have high similarity while objects in different groups have low similarity. The purpose is to make the distance between objects of the same type as short as possible and distance between individuals of different types as long as possible 4  C. Process of Data Mining Data mining is as iterative process of human-computer interaction as shown in Figure 1 which can be divided into three parts    Figure 1. Process of Data Mining  1 Data Prepare. According to statistics, during the data mining implementation period, 60% of the time are spent on data preparation which shows the strict requirements of the data. This phase includes data selection, data preprocessing and data transformation three steps  2\ing. Do data mining on the obtained and transformed data. Different mining algorithms have different efficiency in the implementation; therefore we should choose the appropriate mining algorithm based on the characteristics of the mining task  3\aluate. Do analyze to extract information according to the decision from the final user to distinguish the most valuable information and submit it to decision makers through the decision support tools. It can be seen that the data mining process may take several cycles repeatedly. Once a step does not match the expected target, it sh ould return to the previous step, readjust, re-run III. EXTENDED CONCEPT LATTIC With the rapid development of computer and database technology, data storage shows the following characteristics  200  Increase of the complexity of data. The emergence of image data, video data and audio data increase the difficulty of mining 200  Sharp increase in the amount of data. Turing Award winner Jim Gray has proposed an empirical law: the amount of data generated every 18 months of the network environment equals to the amount of the data history 5  200  Multi-data source database With the upgrading of                 6074 


communications infrastructure and data transmission technology, there occurs more and more multi-data source database. These databases are often distributed in different areas, different geographical location and have different storage structures Multi-data source database increases the difficult of data mining and the time for data preparation. We can solve this problem from the following aspect 200  Distributed association rule mining. HD \(Hybrid Distribution\ algorithm is the most mature algorithm in the area of distributed association rule mining 6 It combines the advantages of CD and IDD algorithm to do divide the processor which executes CD algorithm into equal-sized groups with each group as a super-processor within which IDD algorithm is implemented 200  Classification model of multi-data source. General multi-source database includes homogeneous and heterogeneous two types. Meta-efarning provides a method that to mining classification model from data sources of the same kind, which shows the two important characteristics of multi-data source mining algorithms: high parallel performance and low communications load. In this method, supervised learning techniques are applied to classification model mining on contingent data sets, followed by generating a data set through the concept of local learning and generate the final classification model based on this data set  200  Distributed clustering. Most of the distributed clustering algorithms commit to be implemented concurrently. There are two ways: the first is to provide approximate distance measure standard; the second is to provide precise distance measurement by data broadcast     In general, the distributed approach is to use accuracy to exchange speed, because it runs on the local data rather than the overall data which naturally results in a decrease in accuracy  V.  EXPERIMENT DESIGN As shown in Figure 2, the data mining framework is generally divided into four parts: data pre-processing components, data mining engine, model evaluation component and knowledge base components 7  In the data mining model of fashion design teaching, data comes from multiple databases DB1: Educational management system. This system can be further divided into four parts: Students\222 Information Management, including students\222 names, ages and their departments, etc; Teachers\222 Information Management including teachers\222 names, their departments, and course directions, etc; Course Management, including course names textbooks, course hours, course teachers and students who have selected the course, etc; Performance Management preserving each student\222s performance for each course  DB2: Courseware database. A great number of fashion design courseware are stored in this system. Some of the courseware are downloaded from the internet and others are uploaded by teachers. Students can freely browse and use the courseware they need through a networked computer terminal and they can also interact with teachers through this system By the way, the courseware database in the author\222s college is self-developed DB3: Attendance management system. This system is mainly designed to record students\222 attendance for each course Data pre-processing, mainly aim at data in these three databases to complete the tasks as following 200  Data cleaning: fill the vacancy values, smooth noisy data, identify and delete isolated points, resolve inconsistencies 200  Data integration: implode multiple databases, data cubes and files 200  Data transformation: standardize \(to eliminate attributes\d aggregate to project data from a large subspace to a smaller one 200  Data reduction: get the compressed data collection with a small amount to get similar or the same results 200  Data discrete: part of data statue, to statue data through the concept of hierarchy and data discrete which is important to numeric type of data   Figure 2.

 VI. CONCLUSIONS Association rule mining is the focus point research in data mining, and is mostly conducted in the case of multiple data sources. This paper analyzes the theories and methods related to multi-source data mining applied to the field of clothing teaching to dig the association rules within the students. Due to space limitations, this article only gives the relevant system framework instead of details of the mining process References 1 S o ng D a n W a ng L i ho ng G a n Y i ng j i n  223 D e v el o p m e nt o f N e tw o r k C A I  System of Clothing Structure Design\224[J  J o u r na l of C h an gch un University of Technology, 2004\(3\:76-78  2  C h u n g H M  an d P G r ay  223 D ata m i n i ng 224  J   Jo ur n a l o f  MIS,1999,16\(1\:11-13 3  G e n g Ha o 223A p p l i c at i on Of D a t a Mi nin g on E m p l oyees M a na gem e n t  Web Site Design and Implementation\224 [R a l i a n J i ao to ng U n iv e r s ity  2008 4   Z h o u D o ng hu a. \223 S t udy an d A p pl ica tio n o f Cl us te r i ng A n al y s is in D a ta  Mining\224 [R i a n J i ng  U n iv e r s ity  2 0 0 6   5  W a n g K e c h a o 223R es ea rc h of th e R e li ab i li t y of Net w ork S t ora g e S y s t em  Based on Redundancy Mechanisms\224  H u a z h o n g U n i v ers i t y of  Science and Technology, 2006 6   A b g r al l  R., B a ur i n  G Jac q  P   Ric c h i u to  M 223 S o m e ex am pl e s o f hig h  order simulations parallel of inviscid flows on unstructured and hybrid meshes by residual distribution schemes Computers and Fluids,2011 7  J i a w ei Ha n   M i eh elli n e K a m b er  D a t a M i n i n g C on c e pt s an d T e c h ni ques   Morgan Kaumfmann Publisher, Inc, 2001  6076 


X[6 X[1] X[2] X[3] X[4] X[5] X[6 Fig. 1: The Sorted Item-Matrix: An Example formulate our problem as follows PROBLEM DEFINITION. Given itemset 1, ?2, ? ? ? , ??} where each item is represented by a binary vector, ?nd ? pairs of items whose cosine similarity values are among the top-? ones For solving this problem, we can build and maintain the list of the binary pairs with top-? cosine similarity values hereafter we call them the top-? pairs for simplicity during the computation. The rule for the update of the top? list is as follows: 1 binary pair; 2 of the current top-? pairs, the new pair should replace the minimum pair Apparently, the cost of the direct way that computes the values for all ?\(? ? 1 typically very high. And this can be even worse if ? becomes extremely large  too large to be loaded into the main memory  indeed this is a usual case for a market basket data set. So the ?rst point is to alleviate the computational cost by exploiting the upper bound of cosine similarity. Let ?????? denote the minimum cosine value of the pairs in the current top-? list, we have two simple theorems as follows Theorem 2 \(The Filtering Effect can enter the top-? list only if  Theorem 3 \(The Pruning Effect list and its ??????, for pairs in sorted item-matrix, if   The above theorems points out that the upper bound can be used to ef?ciently ?lter and prune item-pairs in the sorted item-matrix. According to 2, for any new pair if   Otherwise, we simply skip this pair without computing  upper bound. According to 3, if ?[?,?] cannot enter the top? list due to its small upper bound, then ?[?,?] will also fail 


to do that given ? ? ? and Instead of the brute force traversal method, TAPEK-TOPK [12] and TOP-DATA[13] are two ef?cient methods to nd the top-? pairs, whose key point is the use of the upper bound of cosine similarity and its monotone property. The TAPEK-TOP-K method traverse the item pairs row by row, from top to bottom, from left to right, in the item-matrix. And the TOP-DATA method conducts a diagonal traversal in the item-matrix. The search starts from the principal diagonal, then goes to the diagonal above the main diagonal, and so on. Previous studies have shown that the TOP-DATA method is more ef?cient than the TAPEKTOP-K method 3. The Max-First Traverse Algorithm In this section, we revisit the top-? cosine similarity computation problem, and propose TOP-MATA \(Top cOsine similarity Pairs using MAx-?rst TrAverse method for very large-scale data sets 3.1. The Max-First Traversal Procedure The max-?rst traversal procedure also takes use of the sorted item-matrix. Roughly speaking, it is an iterative procedure. In each iteration, it selects one row in the upper triangular matrix to check whether there is any pair that can enter the top-? list. Two points should be addressed here First, the selection criterion is max-?rst; that is, the row containing the item pair with the maximum cosine upper bound will be selected Second, one checking is not for one pair only, but includes all the pairs in the same row that have the same maximum upper bound value The whole iteration process will be suspended if the maximum upper bound is no greater than??????, i.e., the minimum cosine value of the current top-? pairs. In what follows, we illustrate the pseudocode of TOP-MATA 3.2. The Pseudocode of TOP-MATA Fig. 2 shows the pseudocode of TOP-MATA. In Line 3 to 6, we initialize a max-heap data structure named to store the up-to-date maximum cosine upper bound of each row in the sorted matrix. It is trivial to note that the maximum cosine upper bound of each row is exactly the one of the left-most pair remained unchecked in this row \(recall the monotonicity of the upper bound 


the use of a max-heap is for the purpose of speeding up the selection of the row with the maximum upper bound as show in Line 7 Line 8 to 23 are for the iterative process. We ?rst check whether the maximum upper bound???????? we ?nd is larger than?????? in Line 8. If not, we stop the iterations and return the current top-? pairs as the ?nal result in Line 24. Otherwise, we proceed to check whether the pairs with can enter the top-? list. Line 12-14 are to ?nd all the pairs with the same upper bound ????????, from to ?[?,???1 ]. Then we ?nd the TID-lists of the items in these pairs for the computations of 2-item supports, and check whether these pairs can enter the top-? list by computing their exact cosine values By procedure Re?neTopKPairs. It is noteworthy that we employ the Vertical Data Layout [14] to facilitate the computation of 2-item supports for cosine similarity. That is, for an item pair, we 1: procedure TOP-DATA 2: ?????? = ?1, ? =Size 3: for ? = 0 to ? ? 2 do // initialize pairUpperHeap 4: ? = ?+ 1    5: Add {?, ?, ?????} to 6: end for 7 8: while ???????? ? ?????? do 9: ? = row index of 10: ?? = column index of 11: ?? = item index whose support is less then ??th item 12: for ? = ?? to ?? ? 1 do 13: Re?neTopKPairs 14: end for 15    16: if ????? > ?????? then 17 18: else 19: ?????????????.???? = {?, ?,?1 20: end if

According to the monotonicity of the upper bound, the next pair unchecked, i.e., ?[?,??] is the candidate. If the cosine upper bound of ?[?,??] is greater than ??????, then it can be added to the max-heap to update the root, i.e., the checked ?[?,??]; otherwise, we only need to disable the root and will not check this row any more. Line 22 is to ?nd the new ???????? after the update of the max-heap 3.3. Avoiding the False-Positive Pair Computations Here, we further explore the characteristics of TOP-MATA Indeed, compared with TOP-DATA, TOP-MATA can avoid the computations of cosine values for false-positive pairs the pairs that have upper bounds greater than the current but smaller than or equal to the optimal threshold, i.e., the minimum cosine value of the ?nal top-? pairs which we do not know during the computational process Let ? denote the optimal threshold, we have the following theorem Theorem 4 In the max-?rst procedure of TOP-MATA given the item pair ? to be checked and ?????? of the current top-? list, we have   


6 PROOF: It is trivial to note that so the necessary condition is obvious. It remains to prove the suf?cient condition. We use the proof by contradiction If  7 Since the?????? is smaller than ?, there must be at least one unchecked item pair that should enter the ?nal top? list. However, according to the max-?rst rule of TOPMATA    8 where ? is any item pair in the sorted matrix that remains unchecked yet. This implies that there will be no more item pair that can enter the top-? list due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound. This contradicts the above result. So we complete the proof Remark. Theorem 4 implies that althoughwe cannot know before we get the ?nal top-? list, the max-?rst strategy can still guide us out of the pool of false-positive pairs as if we know ? already. This can further save the computational time of TOP-MATA 3.4.

These data sets were obtained from various application domains 


All the algorithms were coded in C#, and run in the environment of Microsoft .Net 3.5, on a Microsoft Vista Ultimate platform with SP2 32bit edition.

The Performance Comparison In this subsection, we would like to study the effectiveness of the max-?rst traversal strategy for real-world data sets First, as can be seen in Fig. 4, due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound and the pruning effect of the max-?rst traversal procedure, TOP-MATA consumes much less execution time than the brute-force method. This is particularly true for small ? values. As ? grows, the gap becomes smaller 50 150 250 350 450 550 0 0.5 1 1.5 K Ex ec ut io n tim e\(s ec    Brute?force TOP?MATA a 100 400 700 1000 1300 1600 0 10 20 30 40 50

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
