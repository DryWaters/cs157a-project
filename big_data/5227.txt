Visualization of Streaming Data Observing Change and Context in Information Visualization Techniques Milo  s Krstaji  c Daniel A Keim University of Konstanz Konstanz Germany  milos.krstajic,daniel.keim  uni-konstanz.de Abstract Visualizing data streams poses numerous challenges in the data image and user space In the era of big data we need incremental visualization methods that will allow the analysts to explore data faster and help them make important decisions on time In this paper we have reviewed several wellknown information visualization methods that are commonly used to visualize static datasets and analyzed their degrees of freedom By observing which independent visual variables can change in each method we described how these changes are related to the attribute and structure changes that can occur in the data stream Most of the changes in the data stream lead to potential loss of temporal and relational context between the new data and the past data We present potential directions for measuring the amount of change and loss of context by reviewing related work and identify open issues for future work in this domain Keywords streaming visualization data streams incremental visualization dynamic data I I NTRODUCTION Visualization of data streams in the era of big data has an important role The streams are currently being created everywhere from personal logs where people track their travels over the world or training routines to large network and sensor infrastructures from nancial transactions to social media text streams and this will be an ongoing trend in the years to come Efforts in databases and data management communities on how to efìciently transfer and store all that data have been joined in the last years by the efforts in data mining community on how to deal with the automated analysis algorithms on such a large scale What we are seeing now are the challenges that arise in the domain of data science and visual analytics how to visualize explore and make sense of all these vast amounts of data Therefore visualizations that can help the human to efìciently analyze the part of the current and the past data are of great importance Visualization of streaming data is strongly related to its temporal context and very often methods that map time to the horizontal axis are used to visualize the data stream How do we deìne which part of past data is relevant for the current data and the current point in time Although the data being generated and delivered in the streams has a strong temporal component in many cases it is not only the temporal component that the analysts are interested in There are other important data dimensions that are equally important and time might be just an additional aspect that they care about In those cases we might want to rely on other visualization methods that can show other attributes better than temporal visualizations How should the visualization change when we add new data Does the whole layout have to be recomputed when we add just one element like in force-directed graphs or we can easily add it like in scatterplots But what if the new attribute value is out of current minimum/maximum ranges Can i identify what is new and where did my old data go In this paper we have explored the degrees of freedom of several well-known visualization techniques and tried to identify how these changes relate to the attribute and structural changes that can occur in a data stream The most of the changes can lead to loss of context to the past data from simple cases where the visualization is just minimally changed to signiìcant changes where the whole layout has to be recomputed each visual element moves on the screen and the previous order in each dimension is not preserved II W HAT CAN CHANGE  Established methods in information visualization are typically used to visualize historical datasets We have reviewed several well-known methods that are commonly used to visualize static datasets and analyzed the degrees of freedom for each method i.e we have looked at which independent visual variables can change Even though these methods work with different data types use different visual features and sometimes have completely orthogonal approaches to visualize data they share some commonalities when used to displayed dynamic data For each method we have also discussed which changes in the data structure and data attributes dimensions can occur and differentiated between the changes within range and changes out of range  Our observations show that they all suffer to certain extent from the loss of context with a degree that depends on the type of change that occurs in the data stream and few of them have issues that also exist when working with static datasets such as overplotting and visual clutter The summary of the results is given in the Table 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


change within range small/comprehensible change change outside of range  big change  original data  Figure 1 Changes in treemap The changes in the data stream can lead to adjustments of the rectangle size color and opacity and positioning Although small changes might not lead to a signiìcant loss of context middle bigger changes can lead to complete rearrangement of the layout since the range s and volume of the data stream is not predictable right We have worked under following basic assumptions rst the amount of new data is signiìcantly smaller than the amount of the already processed data or it is just one new element This way we avoid potential issues arising during the visualization initialization stages and minimize the complexity of the problem that would occur when the change between two time steps is bigger than the amount of the past data Although some of the conclusions from our observations could also apply to big changes we believe that it would be very difìcult to describe and deìne such complex changes in the visualization Therefore we decided to concentrate on small incremental changes which can in some cases already lead to signiìcant loss of context Our second assumption is that it is important to understand the relational and temporal context between the new and old objects Otherwise the visualization of streaming data would be visualization of each new increment separately which is not different from visualizing a historical dataset A Treemap Treemap is a well-known space-ìlling technique used to visualize hierarchical data Each node in the hierarchy is represented by a rectangle whose area corresponds to one of the nodeês attribute\(s The ll color of the node can be used to show another data attribute This technique can display both the hierarchy and node values without overlap and has been used extensively since its introduction in There e xist se v eral popular layout algorithms such as squariìed pi v ot slice-and-dice 1 spiral 3 or ordered treemap which try to balance between aspect ratio order and layout stability The obvious advantage of the technique to improve visibility of small items in a single layout is overshadowed by its instability when applied on streaming data and other design issues In man y applications such as monitoring stock market data abrupt layout changes will lead to loss of relational and temporal context of the past 1 Degrees of freedom Treemap belongs to the class of relative visualization techniques in which the features of the visual objects used to depict data items always depend on the features of other data items The basic visual object in a tree map is the rectangle whose size is always proportional to the other rectangles and the xed size of the visualization Typically the rst dimension from the hierarchical dataset is mapped to the area of the rectangles and can change as the underlying dimension in the data stream change over time Next the second dimension from the data is usually mapped to the color according to a predeìned colormap In a streaming data scenario the data is potentially unbounded which means that the colormap needs to be readjusted in every rectangle when only one value in the whole dataset is out of minimum/maximum range An early attempt to map dynamic data changes in a treemap can be found in where color is used to show high activity in the node In this example the rectangle areas do not change their xed size and time is not mapped to any of the visualization primitives Treemap applied on streaming data would belong to the class of visualization techniques that provide implicit temporal context which means that it could be used to represent new data in the context of the past data although it would hardly be possible to reconstruct the history/evolution of the data The color or opacity of the rectangle could be used to reîect recent changes by mapping the time of last change to it Finally the aforementioned issues appear when the changes in the stream occur in the attribute space Additional problems may arise when there are structural changes in the hierarchy i.e when the new nodes are added to the tree the nodes are removed from the tree or the nodes move in the hierarchy This would lead to similar abrupt changes in the layout which occur when the rectangles are resized The issues related to the changes that can occur in the 42

Figure 4 Streamgraph also known as ThemeRiver or stacked graph The optimal ordering of layers requires ofîine calculation such that the streams with the highest wiggles are laid on the outside Image taken from In a data streaming scenario if a new data item arrives whose main attributes are within current dimension ranges it can be placed in the visualization without losing neither the temporal nor the relational context to past data This is shown in Figure 3 middle Minimal loss of context might occur when the data attributes are out of range Figure 3 right which can be also applied to changes in other data attributes point size color opacity or shape Although the loss of context might not necessarily be signiìcant this technique suffers from the problem of overplotting and clutter which is a disadvantage that also exist when working with static dataset Scatterplot similarly to treemap belongs to the class of visualization techniques with implicit temporal context  and one possibility to encode time age of the visual elements on the screen would be to use color or opacity C Streamgraph Streamgraph shown in Figure 4 also known as stacked graph or ThemeRiver  is a well-known technique that is used for visualizing data streams 9 10 11 It sho ws se v eral streams i.e variables that change their values over time and are layered on top of each other and symmetrically along the timeline This is a good example of a popular technique where the term stream is used incorrectly from data streaming perspective because of its strong limitations in terms of streamability  which we will discuss below 1 Degrees of freedom As with other visualization techniques used for time series data the ranges of the axes can change Since the new data is added to the right of the visualization the viewport on the timeline x-axis can either rescale to keep all the past data or just shift and remove the same period length on the left that has been added to the right If the new data is out of range for the maximum values on the y-axis the streamgraph would have to rescale vertically These shifts and size changes do not introduce major losses of context and we treat them as negligible in our observation However an important property of a good streamgraph is the optimal ordering of individual streams i.e the ordering that provides the best legibility of the visualization The legibility criteria is discussed in In order to achie v e good legibility the visual objects layers with the least amount of change are positioned in the middle while the most bursty layers are on the upper and lower side of the Figure 5 Horizon graph is very often used to visualize multiple time series When the new data points are outside the predeìned range the colormap has to be readjusted thus leading to the loss of context of the past data Image taken from graph This ensures minimum wiggles of the surrounding layers Having a layout in which the positioning of each visual object is dependent on all the other objects leads to the following issues when applied to the data stream rst when new data comes in layers have to be reordered which requires recomputing of the whole visualization This does not just increase the performance costs but it can also cause confusion for the user since the mental map of the visualization will not be preserved Additionally the unexpected bursts in each layer which are characteristic for data streams still might not result in a legible visualization even if reordering is applied Second if the layers are not reordered the stability and optimal layout of the visualization is disrupted In that case the visualization depends on the initial layout that doesnêt represent the current state of the underlying data Having so many undesired properties and serious limitations the streamgraph can hardly be a good choice for streaming data However an exception could be made if the following criteria is fulìlled  the bursts in each layer are not too extreme and not too frequent  the number of layers is low  the past data is discarded or approximated using for example multi-resolution time windows  the time for user exploration between two updates is relatively long  there is enough time to inform the user about the new reordering for example using animation D Horizon graph\(s Horizon graph 5 also known as two tone pseudo coloring is a visualization method v ery often recommended for displaying multiple time series due to its efìcient use of space and color than other time-series techniques 14 Losing the context of the past data when working with data streams can occur in two cases First if the new values are 44 


change within range small/comprehensible change change outside of range big change original data    Figure 6 Changes in line chart Adding new data to the current line requires readjustment of the display when the data is out of axes ranges while adding new lines can cause overplotting and clutter outside of range the whole color map has to be reapplied to the whole visualization again Second the order of the horizon charts can change Although this is not the problem of the visualization itself it is an issue since this method is usually used to visualize multiple time series and not just one E Line chart\(s When applied to streaming data this low-resolution technique has the similar properties that were described for streaming graphs rescaling the visualization when the new data is out of range as shown in Figure 6 Since it uses the explicit notion of time the loss of temporal context would be minimal However the well known disadvantages from static datasets such as overplotting and clutter exist here as well when the new variables show up and new lines have to be added to the screen F Pixel-oriented visualizations Figure 7 Pixel-oriented visualization Recursive pattern technique image taken from Pixel-based visualizations Figure 7 are a set of well known techniques for visualization of multidimensional data whose main idea is to use one pixel for one attribute value by assigning the value to the color of the pixel The pixels are arranged according to different criteria with recursive pattern being one of the most popular arrangements  The pix els are arranged according to user deìned parameters for each recursion level Since the data value is mapped to color all the pixels would have to be repainted if the new data value is out of maximum range for the chosen colormap The ordering of dimensions might be another problem that could lead to the loss of context G Word cloud Figure 8 Word cloud visualization The words are usually positioned without overlap using the force-directed method or spiral arrangement Image taken from Word cloud shown in Figure 8 has been extensively used to visualize text data 19 20 17 The layout algorithm tries to pack the words as tightly as possible and two approaches are commonly used force-directed and spiral Applying the force-directed layout to streaming text data can lead to a signiìcance loss of context since the new words that appear in the stream would require the whole layout to be recomputed On the other side spiral layout which places the word with the highest weight in the center and then arranges the rest on a spiral path would lead to loss of context only if the change between the updates is big III C HANGE C ONTEXT M ETRICS AND C RITERIA In the previous section we have described which properties of different well-known visualization methods can change when working with data streams As it can be seen in the Table 2 the majority of problems that occur are related to the loss of context while few methods suffer from problems that already exist with large static datasets such as overplotting or clutter in scatterplots and line charts Our rst step in identifying and describing these problems should be extended to quantifying the loss of context and deìning other optimization stability and aesthetic criteria for streaming data visualization One such metric could be similar to the layout distance change function proposed by Bederson and Shneiderman This metric tries to capture how much two treemap layouts 45 


differ on average by measuring the Euclidean distances between each pair of corresponding rectangles This metric could easily be extended by taking into account variance distance change as proposed in to detect changes when few items move by large distances while the most items do not move at all Hao et al propose a similar metric constancy of display  which counts the number of pixel changes per time unit and usage of display space  which suggests that the empty space in the visualization should be avoided However they suggest that these might not be the best metrics and that other metrics should be developed One proposal is to use the pixel coherence  which captures the neighbouring pixels that form a pattern and are percieved as an object It has been suggested that measuring the data shifting to evaluate the usefulness of a visualization is strongly data dependent However these metrics might not be appropriate for scatterplots and other techniques in which rescaling of axes occurs see Figure 3 In such cases the movement/change of the objects points lines etc on the screen might be signiìcant although it wouldnêt necessary lead to the loss of context This example shows how an abstract structural information can be easily formed when the data allows it and relates to the well known mental map preservation criterion In any case these criteria have to be taken into account together with aesthetic criteria which are often conîicting as seen in the streamgraph example Beck et al deìne different aesthetic criteria for graphs in which beside mental map preservation include reduction of cognitive load and minimization of temporal aliases that occur when a node is positioned after the update in the same place where another node was before the update A survey on visualization of large graphs re vie ws general dynamic and scalability criteria for dynamic graphs and discusses two categories of visual display of time changes on graph elements animation and static displays IV C ONCLUSION In this paper we have described the changes that can lead to loss of context in common visualization techniques when working with streaming data We have addressed the relationship context between the new and old elements and temporal context that distinguishes the new and old elements We have analyzed the usage scenarios under the assumption that the data is being updated one element at the time or delta is much smaller than the rest of the visualization For each technique we have differentiated between the updates that occur within the existing visualization structure and the updates with new elements in the visualization We have identiìed possible research directions for measuring the loss of context Research in streaming data visualization is a new and challenging eld which tackles complex problems in data visualization and user spaces Future work should address the challenges that occur in transition stages between the updates the propagation of streaming data through the information visualization pipeline and process times needed to get from the raw data to the visualization the interplay between user interaction and automatic updates but also the different types of updates automatic and user triggered Finally an important research direction is how to deal with the visualization when the volume of the data is too big and data approximation occurs R EFERENCES  B Johnson and B Shneiderman T ree-maps A space-ìlling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures in Visualization 1991 Visualizationê91

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
