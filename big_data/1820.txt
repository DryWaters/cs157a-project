  1 Acquisition and Pointing for a Mars Optical Access Link Martin Regehr, Joseph Kovalik, Abhijit  Biswas Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109 818-393-1203 Martin.W.Regehr@jpl.nasa.gov  Abstract 227Optical characteristics can potentially benefit communication links transmitting data from the surface of Mars to orbiting assets because of their high gain and modulation bandwidth compared to radio frequency \(RF links. Furthermore, optical systems can achieve higher data rates and be realized with lower mass and power, enabling the streaming of high definition imagery.  In this paper we present a conceptual desi gn for a low complexity autonomous optical communications link for returning data 
at up to 250 Mb/s from the Martian surface. The pointing control is simplified because the short distance \(400-1200 Km\allows us to use relatively wide \(0.6 milliradian transmitted laser beams. Link acquisition is based on the orbiter transceiver \(OT\ind pointing\224 a laser beam to illuminate the lander transceive r \(LT\The LT acquires the link with a spectrally-filtered, wide-fieldof-view camera and subsequently tracks the OT with a twoaxis, stepper-motor-actuator, to send back a laser modulated with high-rate data. The system design also has a provision for the OT transitioning from blind-pointing to closed loop tracking once it acquires the signal from the lander transceiver.  Results from successful ground-based demonstrations performed at JPL, in which the pointing rate required to track an orbiter was emulated by mounting both 
transceivers on rotating stages, and in which we transmitted live video and pseudo-random data streams, are presented 12  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  C ONCEPT O F O PERATIONS 2  3  T RANSCEIVER A RCHITECTURE 2  4

We have modeled the Mars atmospheric attenuation and s cattering characteristics and obtained favorable agreement with measurements made by 
Mars missions such as Viki M E R 3 and t h e M a rs Observer Laser Altimeter \(MOLA Th ese resu lts will be reported elsewhere, but we have used the results in the link analysis reported here.  The effect of Mars atmospheric turbulence on laser propagation is not addressed in this report although there is evid t o  suggest  t h at  t h e impact may be minimal To be a viable replacement for the low-complexity UHF links in use today, any candidate optical link must both acquire lock and operate autonomously. The relatively short distance covered by the access link makes it possible to use a wider beam while still delivering a desired irradiance to a remote receiver, thereby simp lifying the pointing problem We believe that robust solutions to these challenges, with mass and power consumption comparable to those of 
currently used UHF links, will make a very strong case for implementing optical links in future Mars missions Moreover, the case will likely be of equal merit at the Moon, especially for suppor ting lunar surface missions planned in the next decade In Section 2 we describe the concept of operations followed by a description of th e transceiver architecture in Section 3.  In Section 4 link analysis showing adequate signal-to-noise ratio for acquisition and communication is presented.  In Section 5 the prototyping effort to implement low-cost transceivers with commercial parts is described followed by preliminary results of end-to-end link emulation in Section 6.  Conclusions are presented in Section 7 


  2 2  C ONCEPT O F O PERATIONS  Figure 1 shows an overview of the operations concept.  The orbiter transceiver \(OT on a spacecraft orbiting Mars while the lander transceiver \(LT\prising a WFOV camera and separate gimbaled telescope, is on a Mars surface asset Figure 1:  Lander Transceiver \(LT\ and Orbiter Transceiver \(OT  Our concept of operations for autonomous acquisition presumes that both the position and attitude of the orbiter are precisely known, from ranging measurements and from a star tracker on the orbiter respectively.  The lander\222s position is well known from ranging prior to landing, from any prior optical contact with the lander, and from its low maximum velocity, if it is capable of moving at all.  The lander\222s attitude, however, may have uncertainties of several degrees in both elevation and azimuth Pointing acquisition proceeds in four phases.  First, the OT using \223blind\224 pointing based on knowledge of the orbiter position and attitude, and know ledge of the lander\222s position, illuminates the LT Second, the LT detects the beam from the OT, and the LT telescope is aimed at the OT.  To detect the OT beam, the LT employs a wide-field-of-view \(WFOV\era Because other bright objects will be in the WFOV camera\222s field of view, the camera uses both an optical spectral filter and motion detection to reject sources other than the beacon transmitted by the OT.  The optical filter is a narrow \(2 nm bandpass filter centered on the OT\222s laser wavelength Motion detection is done usi ng a moving-difference filter i.e., consecutive exposures taken by the WFOV camera are subtracted, so that stationary or slowly-moving objects are nearly invisible, whereas the beacon from the relatively fastmoving orbiter produces a large amplitude negative spot at the location it occupied in the first of a pair of images and a large positive spot at its location in the second image These peaks are identified by an appropriate algorithm in the LT.  The OT\222s beacon laser spot on the WFOV camera focal plane is used to determine the OT azimuth and elevation coordinates to within 17.5 milliradians, and using an appropriate transfor mation these co-ordinates are used to point the gimbaled LT telescope Third, once the OT\222s beacon is in the field of view of the LT\222s pointing detector, control of the LT\222s telescope pointing gimbal is transferred from the WFOV camera to the LT pointing detector. This establishes pointing lock allowing the LT to point at th e OT with sufficient accuracy to illuminate the OT, and to maintain the beam received from the OT on the LT\222s communication detector Finally, when the OT detects the beam transmitted by the LT, control of the OT\222s telescope pointing gimbal is transitioned from a blind pointing mode to a closed-loop mode in which pointing is controlled by the error signal from the pointing detector 3  T RANSCEIVER A RCHITECTURE  The orbiter and lander transceiver both use a small lens coupled to an optical fiber for transmission, and a significantly larger lens for reception. The transmitter and receiver lenses are boresighted to each other.  To minimize the burden on the lander a larger receiving aperture is used in the OT.  Schematic diagrams of the LT and OT architectures are shown in Figure 2 In the LT, Figure 2\(a\passed through a narrow-band filter \(NBF background light, and then split, using a beam splitter \(BS between the communication detector and the pointing detector.

Figure 5 shows this result for the signal incident on the OT communication detector. The signal at the WFOV camera and the pointing and communication detectors on the LT can be scaled by using the appropriate parameters listed in Table 1.

A photon coun ting receiver with a photodetection efficiency of 0.1 was presumed with 3 dB of receiver implementation loss and 3 dB of link margin. The Poisson channel capacity and data throughput assuming pulse-postion modulation \(PPM was est i m at ed.  A minimum slot width of 1 ns and PPM orders from 4 to 32 were presumed. The estimated throughput for a code rate of 0.5 as a function of zenith angle is shown in Figure 6\(a a b Figure 6: \(a\ Data rate as a function of photon flux\(b fractional duration as a function of photon flux The one-month duration SOAP simulation was used to determine that the fractiona l \223contact\224 time between the orbiter and lander, defined as the fraction of time that  the orbiter is more than 10 260 above the horizon as seen from the lander, is 1.6%.  Figure 6, also generated using this simulation, shows the fraction of the contact time that the photon flux exceeds various values; for example for OD=1.0, the photon flux exceeds 10 9 ph/s approximately 50% of the time 


  6 Numerically integrating the product of the data rate and the b provides a weighted average data rate that can be used to estimate the data volume per sol.  We obtained 188 Gb/sol for OD=0.6 and 135 Gb/sol for OD=1.0.  These data volume estimates presume data exchange during all contact time;   realistically acquisition will consume some of the contact time. Assuming this does not exceed 30% of the contact time, estimated data volumes of 90-130 Gb/sol are obtained Downlink Both because of the high cost of delivering mass to the Martian surface, and because the data rate needed to send commands to the lander is low, the LT uses a substantially smaller telescope, with a clear aperture diameter of 2.2 cm The receiver on the LT will be based on simple photodiodes and with the OT transmitting 1 W of laser power \(see Table 1\nstantaneous data rates ranging from 0.05-1 Mb/s are expected 5  T RANSCEIVER P ROTOTYPING  Prototype Lander Transceiver Design The prototype LT shown in  Figure 7\(a diameter clear aperture lens with a 25 mm, 3 nm wide narrow band filter mounted in front.  A silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor \(CMOS\camera manufactured by Basler \(Model A601\was used as the pointing detector.  A commercial avalanche photodiode was used for the communication detector.  The LT laser is a 1060-nm fiber-coupled Lumics laser diode, coupled to a fiber Bragg grating which limits it to single-mode operation and reduces the linewidth of its output. A single-mode optical fiber patch cord delivers the laser light to the optical head, which transmits a 2 milliradian beam.  This beam divergence exceeds what eventu ally would be implemented for a Mars access link, but was adopted for prototyping so that using commercially available gimbals and components a viable yet cost-effective system design could be devised for proof-of-concept validation.  The laser transmitter can be modulated with streaming video by means of a Serial Digital Interface \(SDI\module that outputs a 270 Mb/s signal.  Alternatively, a pseudo-random bit sequence PRBS\generator at 200 Mb/s PN7 was used to modulate the laser  The optical head of the LT was mounted on a Directed Perception D46B two-axis micro-stepper motor gimbal The pointing detector read-out, processing \(centroid calculation\mbal commanding were performed using a compact PXI crate based processor running real-time LabView from National Instruments The WFOV detector in the prototype LT uses a Fujinon 1.8 mm focal length 1.4 focal ratio fisheye lens.  This commercial lens provides a field of view exceeding 2 004  steradians:  when pointed vertically upwards it is able to image a region extending from straight up to 5 degrees below horizontal.  In order to achieve spectral filtering with this lens custom re-collimation optics were integrated with the lens so that the narrow band filter was in a collimated part of the beam.   This assembly afforded only a 0.7 mm entrance aperture diameter comp ared to 3.9 mm used in our analysis in Section 4 and the optical transmission of the overall assembly was 23%, whereas we expect 50% in a Mars link \(see  Table 1 The WFOV lens introduces significant aberrations.  As a result, it was necessary to perform a calibration procedure to determine the pointing command which, when sent to the LT gimbal, would result in the LT telescope pointing at an object identified in the WF OV camera image as the OT beacon This calibration was done by setting up the lander transceiver prototype in a white half-dome, onto the interior of which we projected a laser spot.  A control loop was closed around the pointing detector and the gimbal in the prototype lander transceiver, so that the gimbal would follow any motion of the laser spot.  The spot was then moved to a range of positions on the interior of the dome and gimbal position was recorded together with the laser spot coordinates measured simultaneously in the acquisition camera. A two-dimensional fitting routine was then used to determine the coefficients in a mapping from pixel coordinates in the acquisition camera to azimuth and elevation angles in the lande r transceiver gimbal.  This procedure is detailed in  Prototype Orbiter Transceiver \(OT\  Design The prototype orbiter transceiver uses a 500 mm f/8 Tamron lens with a 6.9 cm aperture diameter as a receiving telescope.   The navigation camera and pointing detector utilize Basler Model A601 silicon CMOS cameras.

The laser beamwidth transmitted from the OT was also 2 mrad for reasons similar to those discussed above for the LT The OT optical head was mounted on a Directed Perception D300 two-axis gimbal and an Optics in Motion fast steering mirror was used for fine poin ting control of the received beam.  The actuators and sensors on the OT were controlled with a compact PXI real time processor running LabView Link demonstrations were performed using the fields of view shown in Table 1. Although the link performed satisfactorily in tracking mode, link acquisition, i.e transitioning from the blind-pointing to the closed-loop tracking mode was not very robust. This was attributed to the fact that the disturbance a ssociated with the rotary base see Section 6\o emulate the angular slew rates was too severe.  Subsequent tests performed with 0.5 260 fields of view were not troubled by these problems 6  P ROTOTYPE L INK        Figure 9:  The link used with the prototype transceivers is shown by a red line on the aerial image.   The link distance is 500 m over an atmospheric path The prototype transceivers described were used for proofof-concept testing of the acce ss link acquisition, tracking and bi-directional data transfer.  The tests described were conducted on the grounds of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL\in Pasadena.  JPL\222s main campus is sited on the side of a relatively steep hill, including a peak of approximately 2000 foot elevation known as the \223mesa,\224 on which we set up one transceiver of the prototype link.  Many of the buildings on the JPL campus are visible from the mesa; the roof of one of these, Building 238, was chosen as the location of the other transceiver \(see Figure 9  Setup for simulating orbiter overflight During a Mars access link pass in which the orbiter overflies the lander, the lander will likely be stationary, so the lander transceiver pointing will need to change to follow the orbiter as it passes overhead.  Moreover, the attitude of the orbiter may be fixed in inertial space, or constrained by other requirements such as the orientation of solar cells, so that it may be impractical to require the orbiting spacecraft to maintain a constant attitude with respect to the direction to the lander.  As a result, motion of the pointing control systems in both transceivers will likely be required to keep the transceivers aimed at each other   Figure 10  Prototype lander transceiver mounted on gimbal simulating motion of the orbiter transceiver     Figure 11 Prototype orbiter transceiver mounted on a second gimbal during link emulation tests  Also as a result of the relative motion, the motion-detection algorithm in the lander transceiver\222s acquisition system will be able to take advantage of the motion of the orbiter across the Martian sky  This relative motion is difficult to produce directly in a ground-based test such as the one set up at JPL.  To simulate the relative motion, the prototype lander transceiver gimbal and the prototype orbiter transceiver gimbal were each mounted on a similar gimbal, which was then driven to simulate the relative motion of orbiter and lander in an access link.  Slew rates between 0.5 to 2 Mesa Bldg 238 518 m 10-deg. Slant path 


  9 degrees/second were typically used.  These rates exceed those corresponding to access li nk conditions, but smooth lower rate slews are difficult to generate using the commercial gimbals in the prototype link  In the case of the prototype LT, the LT gimbal and the LT acquisition camera were mounted side-by-side on an aluminum plate which was then mounted on the lower gimbal.  See Figure 7\(a\est configuration is shown in Figure 8\(a  During link demonstration tests at JPL, acquisition, pointing control, and optical data transmission were demonstrated Pointing acquisition was accomp lished by first manually aiming the prototype orbiter transceiver at the prototype LT to simulate the latter\222s illumination by blind pointing of the former.  The remainder of the acquisition process was automated: the OT\222s beam wa s easily detected by the LT\222s acquisition camera, and the LT then locked onto the OT\222s beam, and illuminated the OT, which then also locked onto the beam it received.  Figure 12 shows azimuth \(a\and elevation \(b\motion of the LT gimbal, as it moves to track out simulated orbiter transceiver motion, introduced by the lower gimbal on which the LT gimbal and acquisition camera are mounted.

Figure 14 shows similar performance histograms for the OT, showing somewhat better performance than in the lander transceiver Pointing performance at both ends was sufficiently good to achieve reliable communication with 1 mrad beams although the beams used in the demonstration had widths of 2 mrad.  In particular, these pointing errors would result in pointing loss less than the 3.5 dB allocation 99 % of the time in the transmission from the OT to the LT, and 96.5 of the time in the reverse transmission; consequently pointing errors would result in only a slight reduction in link capacity  During the link demonstration tests we demonstrated data transmission in all of the supported data transfer modes 200 Mb/s\m the LT to the OT, and low-rate PRBS \(50 Kb/s from the OT to the LT   Figure 12  a\ Azimuth axis motion of LT gimbal \(b Elevation axis motion of LT gimbal \(c\ Centroid of OT beacon moving on the WFOV camera    a Angular-travel of base Acquisition Angular-travel of base Acquisition  b Angular-travel of base Acquisition Angular-travel of base Acquisition  c Wide-Angle Camera Record of OT laser spot motion Stray points were random noise prior to acquisition Wide-Angle Camera Record of OT laser spot motion Stray points were random noise prior to acquisition 


  10  Figure 13:  Prototype lander transceiver tracking errors 7  C ONCLUSION  An optical access link would be id eally suited to the task of returning high-rate digital data containing high-resolution images from the surface of Mars to a relay satellite in orbit around Mars.  In such an access link, the range is sufficiently small that only moderately high precision pointing is needed, so that the pointing control systems could be made relatively simple, light, and inexpensive.  We have constructed a prototype of such a system, which uses only a motorized gimbal for pointing control in the lander transceiver, and a motorized gi mbal together with a fine steering mirror in the orbiter transceiver.  Using these prototypes, we have demonstrated sub-milliradian pointing performance, and the transmi ssion of digitized streaming video at a data rate of 270 Mb/s.  Key ongoing developments include making the initial blind-pointing more reliable and building a larger entrance aperture diameter WFOV camera.  We also plan to identify space qualified parts that could be used in future transceiver designs     Figure 14  Prototype orbiter transceiver pointing errors   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration The authors gratefully acknowledge contributions by Kevin Birnbaum, Jeffrey Charles, Carlos Esproles, Malcolm Wright, Vachik Garkanian, and David Zhu towa rd development and testing of components and support during link emulations  R EFERENCES   C.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
