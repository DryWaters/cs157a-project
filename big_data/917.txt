INTRODUCTION Parallel computing is an effective way to solve the problems of enormous computation caused by complicated algorithm for geo-computing [1] and unprecedented large data scale However, it still remains a big challenge for us to build a high performance geo-computing system which should be of high processing speed and be also easily used by normal users who know less about high performance system The main problems of building such system include how to eliminate the I/O performance bottle-neck [2] caused by handling massive large-scale image data related to data intensive algorithms, how to build parallel processing models with high parallel efficiency and also make the parallelization [3] transparent to normal users, how to deal with the data managing problem result from the relevancy between geo-information and remote sensing image data All of these problems make the system construction more difficult in building a general procedure for most processing task and making such procedures be easily understand for normal users In this article, a new architecture [4] [5] for the highperformance geo-computing is illustrated to demonstrate our solutions to the above key issues 2. SYSTEM FRAMEWORKS Based on the analysis of the characteristics of Geocomputing and the current feasible technical approaches to general high performance computing, we designed a new architecture for the high-performance geo-computing which illustrated in fig 1 to demonstrate our solutions to the above key issues The system continuously accepts the data processing task through web service interface, and then the task is automatically parsed as data processing workflow consists of various parallel algorithms by workflow engine like OsWorkflow. All the parallel geo-computing algorithms in these workflow procedures are finally scheduled by task scheduler like OpenPBS among the computing nodes in cluster. Furthermore, according to the current system load 


cluster. Furthermore, according to the current system load situation including I/O load, CPU load of computing nodes as well as network load, the load balance strategy is utilized in task scheduling IV - 49978-1-4244-3395-7/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE IGARSS 2009 Fig. 1 Layer Architecture of Cluster-based High-performance Geo-computing System When encountered with tasks of processing large scale data more than Gigabytes, the I/O time will be extremely large. Therefore, when the processing task is triggered, the remote sensing image data are loaded from various data repositories on the internet as input and save into the highperformance geo-data object storage system \(HPGOSS based on parallel file system pvfs2. The image data together with relevant geo-information are transformed to a geo-data object, and the data is automatically divided into blocks and are distributed among I/O nodes in cluster to provide parallel I/O Parallel programming is really complex and tough for domain researchers in geo-computing. So, based on the general MPI parallel computing technique, and parallel I/O provided by HPGOSS, a serial of parallel scheme for parallel geo-computing algorithms is proposed in this paper also the parallel programming model is provided for fast parallelization of various geo-computing algorithms. The HPGOSS and parallel programming model will be deeply probed into in the following sections The system platform is a multi-core cluster build with distributed storage of terabytes storage capacity and the Infiniband network with high speed and low latency 3. PARALLEL I/O AND HPGOSS To Improve I/O performance and solves the data management problem caused by the close relevancy between geo-information and remote sensing image data, A High Performance Geo-data Object Storage System HPGOSS problems. In HPGOSS, the remote sensing image data and relevant geo-information are abstracts into a single geo-data object. And the image data are distributed among I/O nodes of parallel file system to support massive large scale image data and provide parallel and concurrency I/O, while the Geo-information is managed by the metadata nodes 3.1 Parallel I/O and Data Distribution With the rapidly upgrade of CPU, the performance gap between CPU and I/O is widening. As we are using a large number of CPUs\(computing nodes implementation of geo-computing algorithms, the I/O quickly became the performance bottleneck Fig 2 shows HPGOSS  s parallel I/O design and data distribution storing, to solve the I/O bottleneck problem and to make the I/O performance more scalable In HPGOSS, the disk arrays mounted to the I/O nodes in cluster are virtualized to a single file sys-tem mirror by pvfs2 as showed in figure 2\(a data are divided into data blocks, and distributed among the disk arrays of I/O nodes. The data distribution strategy is showed in figure 2\(b processing procedure, each computing node could concurrently read the data whenever needed. And the I/O operation will be transforms to several parallel I/O requests to corresponding I/O nodes, and then each I/O node fetches data from disk arrays in parallel. Consequently, the parallel I/O provided at different system level significantly speedups I/O performance and allows a better scalability than ever a Local Sata RAID Array I/O Node Local Sata RAID Array Local Sata RAID Array

The operations include discontinuous block data accessing, data resampling projection and coordinate system transformation and etc The logic model is depicted in Fig 3 Fig. 3 Logic Model of Geo-data Object in HPGOSS 4. PARALLEL SCHEME AND PARALLEL PROGRAMMING MODEL There are various processing algorithms with highcomplexity in geo-computing domain. To study the parallel strategy of each single algorithm and to parallelize it is not only terrible, but also unnecessary. Consequently, by probe into some typical algorithms, we categories and design several parallel schemes for geo-computing and it corresponding parallel programming models for fast parallelization In this paper, we put forward task-pool based pipeline parallel programming model illustrated in fig 4. This model is suited to the algorithms with repetitive computing on finite data area, like Geometric correction, image registration, image fusion and so on Fig. 4 Processing Flow of Task-pool based Pipeline Parallel model To avoid massive global Serial I/O operations, we eliminate data gathering and data scattering. Due to HPGOSS, the data loading and output could be implemented in parallel by each computing node dynamically concurrently when needed. Furthermore, the I/O hidden strategy realized by data prefetching is put forward to handle the I/O waiting time issue As is showed in above figure 4, a master-slave parallel mode is adopted. The master node is responsible Getting parameters, task partition, task scheduling and load balancing among computing nodes in cluster. While the slave nodes getting task and then enter into a multilevel pipeline consists of multiple processing functions and data reading and data exporting, all the processing steps in this pipeline would implemented as a thread through multi 


pipeline would implemented as a thread through multithread technique. Thus, multiple cores of CPU can be sufficiently utilized. A ring buffer filled with image data is shared by these threads. In addition, the TaskScheduling module of master node uses following subtask dynamic scheduling strategy Fig. 5 Subtask Dynamic Scheduling Also, the corresponding scalable parallel programming model based on design pattern method is showed in fig 5 For normal users, just trough the overloading and realization some function including GetParam and some DataProcessing in class TaskpoolPipelineParallelModel, can the algorithms be fast parallelized. And for the advanced users, the TaskPartition, loadBalance and TaskScheduling can also be overloaded to scale the task partition, dynamic load balancing and scheduling strategy Fig. 6 Programming Model for Task-pool based Pipeline Parallel model IV - 51 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this article, we demonstrated some of our approaches to meet the challenges in high performance geo-computing These approaches include parallel I/O and data distribution of HPGOSS, parallel programming model for fast parallelization and performance improvement, the workflow and task scheduling and so on. These techniques work coherently to construct a new framework of cluster-based parallel processing system for high-performance geocomputing. Finally, such system could provide a parallel geo-computing environment with high performance, easy to use, optimal resource utilization, and high scalability 6. REFERENCES 1] Keith C.

  5 and Baker et al  general l y depended on t h e uncert a i n t i e s assumed for the satellite measurements, but they all indicated that errors in flux estimates from OCO would likely be low enough to produce scientifically useful results For instance OCO should be able to detect a 1 GtC yr 1 sink in a Northern Hemisphere area smaller than 1000 x 1000 km and t h e European sum m e r anom al y  of 2003 of 0.5 GtC [13 Ch ev allier et al  poi nt out however, t h at  using available and currently planned surface and satellite measurements, that it is s till unlikely that carbon dioxide measurements can be attributed with sufficient precision to support treaty verificati  As t h ei r exam pl e t h ey  indicate that uncertainties over Europe would remain as high as 0.16 Gt C yr 1 which they compare to an accuracy of approximately 0.01 Gt C yr 1 needed to verify European compliance with the agreed-upon Kyoto protocol reductions. So, if their c onclusions are correct, an improvement of more than an order of magnitude in uncertainty will be required for treaty verification   3 EXISTING GHG NETWORKS  There are currently several extensive ground- and aircraftbased networks that provide measurements for monitoring GHGs in selected locations acro ss the globe.  A selection of these networks is summarized in Table 2.  The GLOBALVIEW GHG climatologies produced by NOAA ESRL use interpolated and extr apolated datasets collected by many institutions at a large number of sites 3  GLOBALVIEW-CO 2 for instance, provides estimates of average weekly CO 2 distributions derived from stationary or mobile \(from ships or aircraft\easurements from 277 sites covering all continents collected by 23 laboratories over 30 years. GLOBALVIEW-CH 4 includes measurements of methane abundances from 216 sites from 13 laboratories made over 25 years.  GLOBALVIEW-CO incorporates measurements of CO abundances from 143 NOAA ESRL sites made over the past 18 years.  GLOBALVIEW 3 http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/globalview CO 2 C13 is derived from observations of 13 CO 2 made by the University of Colorado over the past 15 years at 74 sites. A more recently developed ground-based network, the Total Carbon Column Observing Network \(TCCON\s composed of 19 current and future sun-viewing, Fourier transform infrared spectromete rs that measure column abundances of CO 2 CH 4 CO, H 2 O, and N 2 O at sites to be located in 12 countries 4 The DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement \(ARM\ has a small network of sites with an array of instruments for measurements of a variety of climate-related species and parameters. Only the Southern Great Plains \(SGP\M site includes routine observations of carbon-cycle GHGs 5 Measurements at this site include CO 2 abundance and flux, CO abundance, and CO 2 isotope ratios. Several of these networks are interrelated.  Some of the TCCON spectrometers are or will be co-located with NOAA tall towers, one of them is located on the ARM SGP site, and one of them is located at the ARM Darwin, Australia site Except for the CO 2 flux measurements at the ARM SGP site, all of the measurements mentioned above are abundance measurements, which require inverse models to infer emission source strengths.  There are, however corresponding networks of flux towers devoted to direct measurements of emission source/sink strength.  AmeriFlux is a network of 89 active towers established in 1996 to provide measurements of CO 2 H 2 O, energy, and momentum fluxes for ecosystem exchange studies in North America 6 This network is part of a much larger international flux network called FLUXNET, which includes 500 tower sites globally 7  In general, these measurement sites have been designed to study carbon-cycle science or validate satellite observations under clear-sky conditions a nd have been deliberately located in remote locations away from large sources of  4 http://www.tccon.caltech.edu/index.html 5 http://www.arm.gov 6 http://public.ornl.gov/ameriflux 7 http://www.fluxnet.ornl gov/fluxnet/index.cfm Table 2 Selected Networks of Surface and Aircraft GHG Measurem  Network Measurement Number of sites Timeframe \(yrs GLOBALVIEW-CO 2 CO 2 abundance 277 30 GLOBALVIEW-CH 4 CH 4 abundance 216 25 GLOBALVIEW-CO CO abundance 143 18 GLOBALVIEW-CO 2 C13 002 13 CO 2  74 15 TCCON Column CO 2 CH 4 CO, H 2 O, N 2 O 19 7 ARM/SGP CO 2 CO abundance, CO 2 flux CO 2 isotope ratios 1 17 AmeriFlux CO 2 H 2 O, energy, momentum fluxes 89 13 FLUXNET CO 2 H 2 O, energy, momentum fluxes 500  EPA Registry CO 2 CH 4 N 2 O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6 13,000   


  6 GHGs.  This distribution of s ites severely restricts their utility in verifying emissions from large sources of GHGs Note that as of January 1, 2010, however, EPA will require facilities with GHG emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent \(~13,000 facilities\onitor and report their emissions of CO 2 CH 4 N 2 O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF 6  which will fill data gaps related to large sources in the U.S Nevertheless, there remain severe limitations in information in other countries about large point sources and urban areas that produce a majority of anthropogenic GHGs Satellite observations of GHG abundances can be used to fill the spatial gaps left by sparse and remote placement of surface sites, but these measurements must have high precision and adequate spatial resolution.  Such space-based measurements can also help circumvent resistance to emissions verification from uncooperative countries. In addition, satellite observations that produce high-resolution land-use maps are extremely useful for verifying statistics for emissions inventories. Nevertheless, it appears  unlikely that present GHG measurement networks, even augmented with current and planned GHG measurement satellites, will be adequate to the task of verifying potential GHG treaties Hence, consideration of yet further augmentation is appropriate 4  S ATELLITE AND SURFACE DATA AUGMENTATION  The lack of observations of GHG abundances near urban areas and near large point sources is one of the most significant deficiencies in the current network of monitoring stations.  Augmentation of the fixed surface measurement network to remedy this lack would be helpful. But in addition, a whole constellation of GHG measurement satellites will likely be necessary to multiply the available data by a factor of ten or more.  In addition, some GHGs such as methane and fluorocarbon compounds\much more effective absorbers of thermal IR radiation, and quantification of the uncertainty in their abundances is necessary to reduce the uncertainty in the CO 2  measurements Aircraft-based and mobile surface measurement capabilities could, to some extent, minimize the additional satellite systems required. It would be particularly useful to equip current and future fixed and mobile measurement facilities with automated vertical profiling capabilities.  Currently most tropospheric GHG vertical profiles are derived from in situ instruments on aircraft and from continuous analyzers and flasks at a limited network of NOAA tall towers \(in the planetary boundary layer\pler, the AirCore 8 is capable of producing a vertical GHG profile using a single very long coiled sampling tube when flown on an aircraft executing the required altitude profile  8 Patent pending by P. Tans However, the sampler must be analysed using an appropriate real time instrument shortly after landing. The advantage is that the instrume ntation carried on the aircraft itself can be dramatically simplified. The AirCore also lends itself to measurements using stratospheric balloons which are capable of profiling 99% of the atmosphere. In the longer term, GHG measuring lidar systems of adequate accuracy and precision may also provide needed vertical profile data With regard to a mobile GHG measurement capability, we have developed a conceptual design for a mobile laboratory that could be used to augment current ground-based networks \(Fig. 1\s laboratory includes instruments to measure abundances of important tracers for attribution such as isotopes of CO 2 and H 2 O, as well as CH 4 CO, NO x  SO 2 and black carbon Figure 1 Existing Mobile Laboratory which will be equipped over the next several months for in situ and remote sensing of GHGs to facilitate emissions and uptake rate uncertainty reductions  The mobile laboratory design also includes instruments to measure fluxes of CO 2 and its stable carbon and oxygen isotopes.  These measurements would be compared and combined using transport and mixing models for attribution In addition, the mobile lab design includes a mobile solar Fourier Transform Spectrometer \(FTS\ be linked into the TCCON to observe column greenhouse gas \(GHGs: CO 2  CH 4 N 2 O\and signature species \(CO\ixing ratios.   The mobile lab can be deployed in either urban or rural environments for emissions estimates, verification, and carbon-cycle science.  The conceptual mobile lab design will be developed on a vehicular platform for deployment to sites of interest, for rapid redeployment as winds change to gain better access to emissions of interest, or for following a plume through space and time as it ages. The mobile lab will also be equipped and likely deployed to analyse AirCore samplers so as to minimize the time between profiling, aircraft landing, and AirCore analysis. The shorter that time delay, the higher the fidelity of the GHG profile 


  7 obtained.  It is also possible for this mobile lab to be deployed on a ship for coasta l or open-ocean measurements We view this mobile lab as a potential prototype for a fleet of such labs which could compose one element of an eventual GHG treaty verification system It is difficult to foresee other major advances in technology that will enable novel in situ or remote measurements with better precision, accuracy, or a pplicability to a wider range of species.  One area in which advances are recognized and anticipated, however, is in space-based instrumentation that will allow measurements of vertical profiles of GHGs on a global spatial scale.  The future Active Sensing of CO 2  Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons \(ASCENDS satellite lidar instrument will collect 100,000 clear-sky soundings of CO 2 per day with a precision of 2-4 ppm. This instrument will be a good complement to the future OCO instrument, which has better precision but lacks vertical resoluti  Advances i n  in situ instrument capabilities are currently being made with the development of new laser-based light sources for absorption measurements which allow for either increased precision or better affordability and thus expans ion of ground-based networks 5  C ONCLUSIONS  It is apparent from this review that we are at present a long way from having the technical capability to remotely verify any GHG treaty that may eventually be agreed upon However, the development of that capability is well started It may be that any agreem ent to a GHG treaty will depend upon confidence that such a capability can and will be developed.  If so, our global climate future may depend upon these and similar efforts R EFERENCES   S.

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
