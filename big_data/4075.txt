The energy consumption related to data centers is ever increasing, despite the significant efficiency improvements in the involved technologies and the economic crisis. Pervasive adoption of virtualization, decreasing of PUE as well as new features related to energy-efficiency are not able to stop this growth trend, mainly sustained from the explosion of cloud services in both the fixed and mobile ICT markets. One of the most important factors that contributes to the increase in the data center energy demand is the evolution of data utilization in cloud environments. Big data support is one of the main 
driver of this process,  new data sources continuously produce huge amounts of mostly unstructured data, that should be stored in large centralized storage systems to be accessed by the cloud users and analyzed by the companies in real time This has a disruptive effect for the energy consumption of the data center hosting the above storage resources, thatês why the data need to be stored and analyzed in IOPS intensive style Flash memory technologies can play a key role in such scenario, since they can reduce dramatically both the storage footprint and energy consumption and increase applications performances bringing appreciable economic benefits. This fundamental efficiency and performance improvement for storage architectures canêt be supported by legacy technologies 
because they are not designed to use flash technologies but rather they are based on energy-hungry legacy mechanical disks. That is limit the energy efficiency and performance delivered by solid state disks \(SSD\stalled in legacy storage systems, opening the door to the development of new technologies that will be able to fully exploit the potential of flash disks.  The aim of this work is presenting a brief survey about the potential of flash technologies for improving the energy efficiency of data center storage systems supporting the incoming Big Data services 
I D ATA C ENTER E VOLUTION  The evolution of data center is one of the basic technological challenges characterizing the ICT arena in the 
 
last years. Despite the emergency of several technologies aiming at bringing efficiency in the data center infrastructures, its energy consumption continues to be a really growing trend. First of all, the improvements in semiconductor technology, with the following effects in hardware miniaturization have not found the expected correspondence in a reduced power consumption. In fact while miniaturization has drastically reduced the per-unit power consumption, it has allowed at the same time a larger number of logic ports to be assembled into the same physical space, with the obvious effect of increasing simultaneously both the performances and, power utilization [2 Analogously, the introduction of new more energy-efficient 
devices is not enough to achieve significant improvements since as their total cost of ownership \(TCO\continuously reduces, their usage demand increases consequently, so that the benefits achieved are rapidly overcome by a greater energy consumption and concomitant GHG emissions. This is known as 
or as the Jevons \(technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase, rather than decrease, the rate of consumption of that resource\ paradox or Kazzoom/Brookes postulate [21  A cco r d in g t o a r e c e n tly issu ed Ga rtn e r s report, there are some specific developments that are driving such growth in the data center energy demand 
rebound effect 
 
Hyper data centers: very big data centers, consolidating large quantities of computing and storage, typically focused on delivering cloud services or HPC on a large scale. They will absorb the 17% of physical servers/storage within 2015 starting from the 11% of today HDV: the Hosted Desktop Virtualization, within 2015 the 16,7% of physical servers will be dedicated to HDV Big Data: some strong increasing phenomena such as the adoption of mobile lightweight devices for private life and work usage, with the related cloud-empowered mobile-centric applications and interfaces, are further boosting the data center growth, under the pressure of 
   
the huge volumes of data to be processed centrally II 
D ATA C ENTER P OWER C ONSUMPTION  According with Datacenter Dynamic [3  th e t o t a l  estimated data center energy consumption for 2011 is about 31GW with an increment of 19% foreseen for 2012. The analysis shows also the effect of some fundamental dynamics related, country by country, to both the ICT markets status and the energy sources The global energy demand is however increasing despite PUE \(Power Usage Effectiveness\ improvements. The PUE represents the efficiency of a data center facility expressed as 
 
the ratio between the total amount of power used and the power delivered to the equipment, thus assessing the fraction of energy consumption due to, the HVAC \(Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning\, the UPS \(Uninterruptible Power Supply\bsystems and the lighting facilities. Of course, this growing trend in energy demand has also an impact on CO2 and other GHG emissions, introducing side effects on the environment that contribute to pollution and micro-climate changes. This is another fundamental factor that drives the evolution of data center architectures towards

a more energy-conscious and hence eco-sustainable evolution III T HE T ECHNOLOGIES I NNOVATION I MPACT  Figure 1. shows the EPA \(Environmental Protection Agency\orecast about data center energy consumption presented in the report to US Congress on Server and data center Energy Efficiency of August 2nd 2007 [2 Such report emphasized that in 2006 data centers consumed the 1,5% of the total amount of US electricity, with a predicted growth trend that should double in 2010. That prediction was related mainly to the growth of the servers forecast whose demand in 2006 was the 68% of the total amount of energy   Figure 1 S TORAGE E VOLUTION  In one of the last data dynamics reports from Forbes [16  regarding Big Data dynamics, IDC confirms the trend claiming that during 2010 the barrier of Zettabytes of data has been cracked and in the 2015 itês expected to get close to 8 Zettabytes [5   The growth trend characterizing the storage market does not follow the typical ICT evolution dynamics observed in the last years. In fact, respect to the past experiences there are different sources and types of data, and there are different tasks and objectives related to data utilization that bring new and challenging requirements for the storage features and performance. The main drivers of such evolution is certainly the constantly increasing usage in many field of science  23 24   e  g ge no m i c s co m p l e x p h y s i c s or  e v er y  dayês life \(e.g., meteorology, finance\ of çBig Dataé - data sets whose size is beyond the management and processing ability of commonly used hardware and software technologies Ö currently ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set. Of course, the explosion of Big Data is not a part of EPA and Koomey analysis, who asserts that the storage-related energy consumption is approximately 17% of the total energy demand \(18,2-24,2 BKWh/year, PUE 1,82-1,91 Furthermore, a Intel internal white paper [17  r e p o r ts  th at  PUE is expected to attain 1,25 \(81% of power delivered to the IT equipment Consequently, reducing the power consumption associated to the storage system will be one of the energy efficiency mainstreams in the next years. In the recent past the adverse effects introduced by the growth in the storage data volumes has been countered with the introduction of several new features in storage devices aiming at reducing the data space occupied on disks, \(e.g., through compression or de-duplication\, or promoting a better usage of disk hardware characteristics \(e.g., through multi-tiering, by using the best storage flavor for each stored data\and improving the energy efficiency \(e.g., through spindle down techniques\. Those features have demonstrated the ability to improve the storage efficiency from several points of view by limiting the explosion of disk space and containing the energy consumption One of the better opportunities related to storage evolution and efficiency, is the one offered by the introduction of Solid State Disks \(SSD\In the recent past 
EPA Forecat and Koomeyês update A study from J.G. Koomey [1  p u b l i s hed  i n t h e 2011  claims that the EPA forecast doesnêt have never become actual. The report [1 sh o w s th at th e a c tu al g r o w th o f d a t a  center energy consumption is about 36% \(1,7% - 1,2% of total use\ in USA and 56% \(1,1% - 1,5% of total use worldwide, instead of doubling as it did from 2000 to 2005 According to [1 t h e di ffe r e nce  d e p e n d s o n bo t h t h e economic crisis and the technological evolution, mostly related to the rapid adoption of virtualization practices introduced by the industries and service providers in order to improve the efficiency of their computing and storage facilities In fact, due to the massive virtualization usage growth of the number of physical servers deployed in modern data centers is slowing down despite an explosion of the application services delivered. The biggest services providers have also been able to reduce drastically the infrastructureês electricity usage compared to in-house data centers through the use of cloud computing technologies Itês very interesting to observe the improvement of the PUE occurred in the recent past. In fact, starting from the typical reference value of 2 assumed by both Koomey [1 and the EPA report a c oup l e  o f  r e c e n t sur ve y s  i ssued form EPA and Up Time Institute conducted in 2011, show an average PUE of about 1,8-1,9 ranging between 1,3 \(for large installations\ and 3,6. A last remark concerns storage and communication, Koomey [1  as s e rts th at th e  en e r g y  consumption related to communication and storage has been estimated by considering the same growing ratio experienced by servers. Instead, there is practical evidence that the needs for storage continues to grow more rapidly than the one characterizing computing power. The total power used by the storage devices is primarily related to the number of drive spindles, not just to the amount of data they hold. Thus considering that the data density of storage devices is also growing rapidly \(doubling every year, according to Grochowski and Halem [4   th e  rel ati o n s h i p  be tw een th e  total storage capacity and the associated energy usage is not so immediate. Accordingly, in order to correctly investigate the data center energy consumption we have to consider the role of storage systems into the overall infrastructure economy IV

the adoption of SSD technology has been limited by the cost the size and the reliability of the available implementations However, recently, a strong boost to the adoption of SSD technology is coming from the emerging requirements of modern applications as well as the wide adoption of mobile devices and, of course, by the significant improvements achieved in the SSD technology 9  Nev e rth e less   t h e l e g acy st or ag e a r ch it ectu re s have been historically designed to use HDD devices and then are not able to fully exploit the power of SSD devices. In particular, there are several limitation coming from the integration of SSD in legacy storage systems legacy storage doesnêt  scale in terms of real I/O performance, by wasting most of the SSD advantages legacy storage doesnêt manage write cliff effect so canêt grant performance in steady state. [18  1 9  the use of legacy RAID processes reduces the lifetime of SSD legacy storage architectures adopt SSDs in their own form factor, limiting the storage density per rack unit Several startup companies were born in the recent past with the aim of creating new storage architectures focused on SSD. Emerging storage architectures try to address the previous limitations by using specifically designed devices tailored on SSDs characteristics. For instance, devices from Violin Memory \(www.violin-memory.com\, leader in virtualization and database benchmarks, are able to guarantee 1 million of I/O operations per second \(IOPS\, with few tens of microseconds of latency and 99.9999% of availability From the economic side, in order to understand the real cost of SSDs we need to consider their TCO and ROI [7  nd not just the ratio cost/capacity of SSDs and HDDs. The TCO/ROI are tightly related to the emerging storage requirements that are coming from business and applications I/O Performance, that is more IOPS and lower latency Concurrent workload and performance predictability Scalability Figure 2. shows the relation between applications and their performance requirements [9 Mor eo ver per for m a nc e  requirements are changing with the adoption of highly virtualized architectures; it is estimated that the cloud environments require the 7-8% of total storage capacity in SSD technology [9  T h e cu rr en t  a p pr oa ch of dat a  cen t e r  storage designers is based on the storage multi-tiering, thatês why the cost of SSD is not yet comparable to the cost of HDD, and, in order reduce the storage costs, the mostly accessed data are dynamically moved, in a manual or automatic way, in the best performing storage layer. There are several studies on modeling the multi-tiered storage systems aiming at predicting the storage composition in advance, in order to balance its costs and performance  11   Figure 2 Concerning the benefits that SSD technology can introduce, there are several elements to be considered, and in order to give an idea about the overall potential and effects we present the following  real use case We consider a typical application well suited for exploiting the power of SSD: the Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure \(VDI\ Itês well known that VDI is an hard scaling application, mostly for the current performance limitation in legacy storage systems. In our real case we suppose to design an architecture for a 5.000 hosts Virtual Desktop infrastructure by using a typical configuration for the desktop based on Windows 7 - 2GB RAM - 30GB user data. According with the well-known Citrix best practices we have to consider to put on performance storage swap file and write cache file that we can estimate as 6GB/user [12   There is a lot of literature about VDI storage dimensioning, we consider here a basic choice in order to give just an idea about the available alternatives. A better choice can just result from a more detailed analysis on the specific requirements of the target environment. The IOPS requirements depend on several constraints \(e.g., RAM allocations, boot time, logon/logoff time, applications requirements, etc.\, in the Table I are reported the typical IOPS and IO requirement related to Windows 7 [12  TABLE I: Windows 7 characteristics

During the steady state, where the write operations are predominant, it ensures almost 300k IOPS. In order to give an idea of the difference between SSD and HDD, we going to consider a EMC 2 VNX 7500 completely filled with 300GB SAS disks. To address the aforementioned capacity requirements the VNX system needs to be filled by 200 HDDs. On the other hand, to address the performance requirements the VNX needs to be filled by about 3.200 HDDs, that means using 4 VNX 7500 three of them completely filled. The Table IV show the dramatic differences in both power consumption and space occupation between the solutions considered \(the results would be the same if we consider other manufacturers instead of  EMC 2  TABLE IV: Performance comparison between the two solutions Space 840R U 4R U 99,3 Power Consumption 38,5K W 4K W 89,6 IOPS 580 K 1M +72 Coolin g 168,400BTU h 5,800BTU/7 h 96,5  The benefit on energy demand and cooling following the introduction of the new flash array technologies is really impressive. Notice that in order to satisfy both the I/O performance requirement and the capacity one it is necessary to oversize the HDD storage from 60TB to 960TB. To get the same total cost of disk acquisition, the price/GB ratio of SSDs should be 15 times the one of HDDs. Currently MLC flash costs approximately 5.9 $/GB [1 w he r e a s hi gh performance enterprise HDDs cost about 2 $/GB. The ratio between the two values is about 3, so very far from the 15 needed to achieve the same total cost Itês also evident that an HDD-based solution is not comparable \(much worse\ in terms of I/O performance latency and IOPS Of course, according to multi-tiering practices, we could introduce an SSDs isle within a VNX legacy storage device It that case, the EMC 2 guidelines sugge st a b u i l ding block design composed by a couple of SSDs plus about 15 HDDs SAS 15K RPM for each 1.000 Virtual Desktops Hence, a project of 5.000 VDI requires five building blocks We have to observe that such dimensioning doesnêt consider the write penalty and takes into account only the I/O performance during normal operations, without caring of the additional load due to boot/log storm and Anti-Virus A bit of skepticism come from the assumption that most of the I/O of normal users, mainly composed by write operations, can benefit on multi-level cache \(DRAM+SSD boosting effects. Anyway, is clear is that the performance of the VNX, like all similar midrange legacy storage products is constrained by its own basic architecture. Basing on VNX scalability of 1.000 drives, we can assume on that the upper limit of its performance capacity is 180K IOPS. To address 6GB of system memory VNX has to be filled with 300 SSD

Itês clear that legacy technologies cannot compete with new Violin all-flash because of the architectural bottlenecks that limit their ability to scale. Thus even if we use just SSDs disks we need to add a large number of devices in order to scale the performance that means more space, energy and cooling In our comparison we are not considering some typical issues related to legacy storage technologies integrated with SSDs like the çwrite cliffé or the disk lifetime [6 T h ese a r e  other two important points that limit dramatically the performance of legacy storage even when they host SSDs Finally, according to [15 th e r e is an oth e r k e y elem en t to  differentiate the technologies.

That requires a couple of VNX 7500 systems \(4-5KW power demand and a 13.000 BTU/h cooling demand\But it is not enough to get 580K IOPS, resulting in 4 VNX 7500 equipped with 300 SSDs of 200GB each, \(6KW power consumption and 19.300 BTU/h cooling demand\ and a total space occupation of 56 rack units in 4 racks \(Table V TABLE V: Performance comparison SSD solutions  Violin doesnêt change his behavior. It scales-up/out in linear style as the VMs grow. The legacy storage solution are very sensible to the workload mix so much that a complete redefinition of the storage system organization/architecture could be needed to address new requirements, even through dedicated solutions V C ONCLUSIONS  In this work we have observed how the energy consumption of the data center,  specifically from the storage point of view, is currently huge and continuously increasing despite the economic crisis and the technological improvements in energy efficiency. The emerging business models, based on real time data analysis and the ongoing adoption of virtualization are changing the way of defining the requirements for storage systems which are more and more based on I/O sustainable performances. This emphasize the limitations of the legacy infrastructures in terms of performance and flexibility, requiring oversized and  \(in the critical cases\ dedicated solutions. Resulting in higher operational costs including increase in environmental costs In this emerging scenario, the significant reduction of the SSD technology costs and the improvements on its reliability are fostering the massive adoption of flash technologies. We have seen like SSD, integrated in brand new architectures can provide strategic benefits in terms of This in turn can dramatically reduce environment cost power, cooling, and footprint We have also explained that to really appreciate the potential benefits coming from the evolution of solid state technologies is necessary to adopt new architectures specifically designed on the base of the solid state device characteristics such as Violin Memory That is what is clearly emerged by the case presented in this paper: benefits more than 90% in terms of power cooling and footprint, and more than 70% in terms of performance

Furthermore, we can observe from Figure 5. another interesting phenomenon: flash technology is able to drain data not just from high performance HDD but also from DRAM. This is the case of emerging in-memory database architectures, like SAP HANA or SAS analytics, designed to reduce the latency time of the legacy storage architecture The use of SSD technologies in these scenarios allows us to deliver suitable performance at lower price than the ones that characterize DRAM-based solutions  Figure 5

show that the correlated subspaces found by 4S are also useful for data classiìcation IX C ONCLUSIONS Mining high dimensional correlated subspaces is a very challenging but important task for knowledge discovery in multi-dimensional data We have introduced 4S a new scalable subspace search scheme that addresses the issue In particular through theoretical analysis we have proven that the subspace search problem can be transformed to the problem of clique mining This transformation not only avoids the high runtime complexity of Apriori methods but also leads to more general results i.e we detect correlated subspaces found by Apriori methods as well as subspaces missed by them Both of these points have been proven in the paper Overall compared to existing work 4S embarks on a completely novel approach to efìciently solving the subspace search problem Empirically we have demonstrated that 4S scales to data sets of more than 1.5 million records and 5000 dimensions i.e more than 1 trillion subspaces Not only being more efìcient than existing methods 4S also better detects high quality correlated subspaces that are useful for outlier mining clustering and classiìcation Directions for future work include a systematic study of our search scheme with different correlation measures and the integration of subspace merge into the correlation graph to perform an in-process removal of redundancy A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported by the German Research Foundation DFG within GRK 1194 by the Young Investigator Group program of KIT as part of the German Excellence

Records from years to were in and the rest were in  Execution times are given in the Figure 8\(c Figures 9\(c and 10\(c again show the execution times for the different parts of the execution in the order in which they occurred As in the previous benchmark the dataîow graph of the weather explorer script consisted of a single MapReduce job WeatherMR for both Rout and PigLatin But in our script we used the operator to join temperature and wind speed inputs instead of the operator Because of this for Rout the scripts could be executed while keeping data GD the distribution of the input data based on the year of its recording allowed to be applied For the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within of the time of the corresponding PigLatin script VI R ELATED W ORK This section describes work related to Rout and Rrun Apache Cascading is another open-source dataîo w engine Cascading consists of a data processing API integration API process planer and process scheduler Like Pig Cascading operates on top of Hadoop in a single datacenter FlumeJava is a statically typed data processing language proposed by Google It is implemented as a Java library A dataîow graph making use of MapReduce jobs for parallelization is generated from a FlumeJava program PQL is another extension of Java recently proposed by Reichenbach et al PQL is a logic-based declarati v e language which facilitates the expression of parallel elements of a computing task with regular Java code being used to deal with the sequential portions The approach supports programmer productivity and allows for aggressive optimizations PQL does not address geo-\ution PLINQ is an e xtension of LINQ 23 for parallel querying of data similar to PQL PLINQ enjoys explicit syntactic support inside NET In contrast to PQL PLINQ is inspired by SQL-style relational queries select statements and is not fully declarative DryadLINQ is an implementation of LINQ for the e x ecution engine None of these languages or their runtime environments currently support setups beyond a single datacenter/cluster Given that all the above-mentioned languages and models revolve around data structures and collections e.g sets maps along with arrays in PQL they are amenable to augmentation with GD data structures Many efforts focus on optimizing dataîow execution instead of dealing with geo-\ution This includes countless optimizations for the MapReduce framework targeting single clusters These are complementary to our work Parcae is a no v el parallel e x ecution en vironment optimized for multiexecutions The solution includes a compiler that creates exible parallel programs a monitor which determines and analyzes resource availability and system performance and an executor which may replace the executing tasks with ones that are better suited for the operating environment Airavat aims at secure analysis of third-party datasets with MapReduce providing strong privacy guarantees in the face of untrusted tasks When combined with a secure inter-datacenter data transfer mechanism solutions such as Airavat can be seamlessly integrated to Rrun to improve the security guarantees of the distributed execution Most commercial databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are designed to handle highly structured data that is available in a single location Many of these databases support multi-region deployments but for high availability and/or fault tolerance Thus they are unsuited for handling GD data Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database solution The back-end of RDS is a relational database deployed in Amazon datacenters RDS supports multi\(availability zone deployments But this is not truly GD since Amazon availability zones are located within a single datacenter Volley is a system for automatically geo-distrib uting data based on the needs of an application presupposing knowledge on the placement of its data client access patterns and locations Based on this information data will be dynamically migrated between datacenters to optimize access times Services like Volley complement a GD dataîow engine but do not replace it Walter is a k e y-v alue storage system that can hold massive amounts of GD data Walter allows transactions and replication of data across

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and efìciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other dataîow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
