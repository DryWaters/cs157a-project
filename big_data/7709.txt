The Empirical Research on the Relationships between Individual Differences and Psychological Contracts Using Knowledge Employees as Research Participants  JIE LIN YIN Economics & Management Institution Beijing Information Science & Technology University Beijing, China yinjielin0924@sohu.com XIN WU Economics & Management Institution Beihang University Beijing, China wuxin@buaa.edu.cn  Abstract 227This research examines the relationships between individual differences \(equity sensitivity and careerism\ and psychological contracts \(transactional, balanced, and relational using knowledge employees as research participants. We test the 
hypothesized relationships using hierarchical regression analysis with data from a sample of 452 knowledge employees from several big cities of China. The results show that equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract and negatively related to balanced psychological contract, and careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract and balanced psychological contract, and negatively related to relational psychological contract Keywords- equity sensitivity careerism; transactional psychological contract; balanced psychological contract; relational psychological contract I  
 I NTRODUCTION  The employment relationship has undergone a number of significant changes in recent years. In large part, this transformation has been brought about by the increasing globalization of business, by the dramatic rise in the number of mergers, restructurings, and layoffs, and by the increasing rate of change that permeates all of organizational life today [1   Since the notion of psychological contract between employer and employee has gained currency as a means of understanding changes in the employment relationship p s y c ho l o gi c a l  contract ha become increasingly important in helping to define the contemporary employment relationship [3   
Psychological contracts consist of the beliefs employees hold regarding the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement between themselves and their organizations [4   Although psychological contracts were first discussed by organizational scholars in the 1960s, only recently have these unwritten work agreements attracted widespread attention Much of this attention has been generated by the perception  that the employment relationship is undergoing a period of dramatic change and that psychological contract violations are becoming more commonplace [5 R e cen t r e s e ar ch  on  psychological contract has generally focused on two areas First, a number of articles have discussed the changing nature 
contents and the types of the psychological contract. Second another line of research has investigated the antecedents and negative consequences of psychological contract breach \(or violation\ on employee attitudes and behaviors. There is little attention given to the antecedents of different types of psychological contracts except some scholars\222 scattered works 6-8  A s t o  th e res e a r ch  p a rt i c ip an ts th e r e is n o  res e a r ch e r to  focus on knowledge employees by far. In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge employees are the most important resources of organizations. Therefore, studying issues related to knowledge employees has great practical meaning. Our paper aims to contribute to the psychological contract literature in the 
following area: investigating the relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants II  P SYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT THEORY  Psychological contracts are an individual\222s beliefs regarding reciprocal obligations in an employment exchange relationship [9 h e s e be l i e fs ar e b a s e d o n  a n i ndi vi d u al 222s  perceptions that promises have been exchange and accepted by both parties. The psychological contract is found to serve as an important regulator of employer-employee relationships [9 10  E m e r gi ng e m p i r i ca l re s e ar c h sugge st s t h at t h e t y p e o f  relationships that individuals perceive they have with their 
employer have important consequences for how the individuals contribute to those relationships [1   Beginning with Macneil, scholars have proposed typologies for conceptualizing the forms that psychological contracts can take. Macneil conceptualized psychological contract on a relational-transactional continuum [4 R o ussea u  pr opo sed t w o  key facets that would help distinguish forms of psychological contract: time frame and performance requirements. Time frame is in reference to the anticipated duration of employment short-term vs. long-term\while performance requirements involve the connection between the rewards employment provides and performance demands \(low vs. highly specified 
performance-reward contingencies\. Rousseau used these two Sponsored by Project of Beijing Owned Colleges and Universities\222 Science and Technology Innovation Platform, Talents Strengthen ing Education Plan Beijing Emphasized Built Subjects and Beijing Knowledge Management Research Base and also sponsored by national science and tec hnology support plan subject \226 Research and Development on Technology Information Service System of Manufacturing Industrial Clusters 978-1-4244-4639-1/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 


facets to develop four types of psychological contract transactional, relational, balanced and transitional. She operationalized the framework in Psychological Contract Inventory \(PCI  Transactional contract refers to short-term or limited duration employment arrangements, primarily focuses upon economic or monetary exchange. In contrast, relational contract  involves a mutually satisfying relationship with openended arrangements that include socioemotional as well as economic terms  based upon mutual trust and loyalty. The third type, balanced contract, consists of an open-ended relational emphasis with the transactional feature of well-specified performance-reward contingencies and it is sometimes referenced as a type of “hybrid” psychological contract [13  Balanced contract expresses employee’s identification with his/her profession [8  Des p it e  co in in g th e n o ti o n o f t r an si ti o n al  contract as a fourth type of psychological contract, Rousseau indicated transitional contract was not a psychological contract but more of a cognitive state, which could be viewed as a total breakdown of an agreement between the employee and his/her organization reflecting the consequences of organizational change [12   A cco r d in g l y   t r an s a cti o n a l  rel a ti on al  an d  balanced contracts represent important types of psychological contract in employment situations Studies have confirmed the types of psychological contract assessed in the PCI in the United States, Singapore [12  L a t i n  America [14 an d C h in a  1 5   A d d iti on ally L e e et al   1 6  examined whether transactional, relational, and balanced contract types were relevant in China by formulating their own measure with the help of representatives from Hong Kong and the United States although they did t use the PCI. The findings of Lee et al. indicate the three forms of psychological contract in both countries and are consistent with the notion that contract types have similar meanings across the two  Based on above empirical researches, our study intends to use PCI to operationalize the psychological contract III  S ELECTION OF INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ANTECEDENTS  From the definition and formation of psychological contracts, we can see that cognition plays a very critical role Lewis, Goodman and Fandt define cognition as “the way that people experience, process, and interpret things around them and further point out, “cognition is not completely accurate because it is influenced by many factors including individual’s experience, demand, personality and education level. Since each one has his/her special cognition, different people have different ideas when they meet the same condition or information [17 Hu se m a n  Hatf ield an d Mile s also th i n k  that individual differences can lead the people to have different cognition when facing the same things because they have different preferen ccording to th eir v i e w points   psychological contracts can be influenced by employee’s characteristics since individual characteristic affects people’s cognition and the cognition plays a critical role in the development of psychological contract. In this paper, we select two most representative individual-level variables of knowledge employees which are different from ordinary employees’ and investigate the relationships between these variables and psychological contract types After analyzing the characteristics and demands of knowledge employees, we select equity sensitivity and careerism as individual-level variables which differentiate knowledge employees from ordinary ones The concept of equity sensitivity was first presented by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles in 1987 which suggests that individuals react in consistent but individually different ways to both perceived equity and inequity because they have different preferences for equity [18  P e op l e  w h o  ha ve  hi gh  equity sensitivity are outcome-oriented. They attach high importance to outcomes and they want to get more when paying the same. Knowledge employees pay much more on money, time and energy than ordinary employees since they spend more time on education and their losses of materials and chances are much more than ordinary employees’. Therefore they hope to get high rewards quickly even if the values of their work are not so much. Besides, knowledge employees think they are superior to others and exaggerate their abilities generally for they own enormous intellectual resources. Based on the above reasons, equity sensitivities of knowledge employees should be higher than that of ordinary employees Careerism refers to the degree that employees view employment with current organization as a stepping stone to another on div i d u als h i gh er on careeris m are more  likely to perceive their current employer as an instrumental stepping stone up the career ladder A s  w e kn o w  that knowledge employees’ need levels are higher, they care the acquirements of self-worth more and they are eager to get internal satisfaction and achievement from their jobs compared with ordinary employees. Once the current jobs are not attractive enough or lack of development and promoting room, they are easy to leave the current organizations and look for new career chances. Accordingly, knowledge employees should be higher on careerism than ordinary employees IV  H YPOTHESIS  As discussed above, those high on equity sensitivity put great importance on outcomes. They desire to get more than others when paying the same. However, those low on equity sensitivity put more importance on their contributions in the exchange relationship and they are less sensitive to equity O’Neil and Mone found that equity sensitivity was negatively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment positively related to intention to quit [19 Su azo in v e sti g at ed  the relationship between equity sensitivity and psychological contract breach and the results suggested that they were positively related [20 T h u s  w e ca n co n c l u d e th a t e m p l o y ees higher on equity sensitivity treat and evaluate what happens in the organization more negatively and they take on fewer responsibilities at work according to reciprocity principle Since balanced psychological contract and relational psychological contract represent the positive views that employees are willing to take on more responsibilities and 


transactional psychological contract represents the negative view that employees are just willing to take on limited responsibilities in the exchange relationship with organizations, we hypothesize that   Hypothesis 1a. Equity sensitivity is positively related to transactional psychological contract   Hypothesis 1b. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to balanced psychological contract   Hypothesis 1c. Equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract From the concept of careerism, we can see that employees higher on careerism are more likely to view employment with current organization as a stepping stone. They have high expectations for their organizations since their needs for career development and individual promotion are very strong Therefore, they evaluate what their organizations give them more negatively when treated equally. Besides, in order to find good excuses, they will pay more attention to negative information of their organizations according to information processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory because they are likely to quit the current organizations at any moment when finding a better job Employees high on careerism are not willing to keep a long and stable relationship with current organizations. They have no affective attachments with their current jobs. The responsibilities to their organizations are not beyond what the written agreements prescribe. However, employees high on careerism have strong commitments to the careers they are engaged in since they especially care career development and individual promotion. This is consistent with what the balanced psychological contract embodies - the identification with the career. Accordingly, we give the following hypotheses   Hypothesis 2a. Careerism is positively related to transactional psychological contract   Hypothesis 2b. Careerism is positively related to balanced psychological contract   Hypothesis 2c. Careerism is negatively related to relational psychological contract The hypothesized relationships are showed in Figure 1        Figure 1  The hypothesized relationships V  M ETHOD  A  Participates In this paper, the following two factors are considered when operationalizing knowledge employees: \(1\asks employees assigned are finished mainly in the office and \(2 employees must gain bachelor or above degrees Data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 600 employees of some high-technology companies according with above requirements from several cities of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hefei. In order to ensure the authenticity of responses, the questionnaire takes the form of anonymity. Out of the 600 employees surveyed, 452 employees completed the survey, a response rate of 75 percent. The sample was 36.5 percent female, 64 percent were under 30 years of age, 3 percent were over 40, 98.5 percent were graduates and above, the average total tenure was 5.2 years \(SD 4.16\ and the average tenure of the current job was 3.81 years \(SD 3.46 B  Measures All measures used a 5-point Likert type scale response format \(1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree\. The reported psychological contract was measured with the revised Psychological Contract Inventory developed by Rousseau which represented the three psychological contract types of transactional and balanced, relational [1 24 i t e m s w e re included \(4 items for transactional contract, 10 items for balanced contract, and 8 items for relational contract\. Equity sensitivity was measured using a 5-item measure developed by Huseman, Hatfield and Miles [18 C a re eris m  w a s m eas u r ed  using 5-item measure developed by Rousseau [9 VI  R ESULTS  Before testing the hypotheses, we examined the internal consistencies of all scales and confirmed the existence of the three psychological contract types. The Cronbach Alpha obtained for transactional psychological contract, balanced psychological contract, relational psychological contract equity sensitivity and careerism was 0.65, 0.91, 0.84, 0.70 and 0.54 respectively. We found that the Cronbach’s of careerism was much lower than 0.70. It was quite bad. The reason may be that two items of careerism measure adopt reverse-scoring and Chinese are not accustomed to answering reverse-scoring items After deleting two reverse-scoring items, the Cronbach’s  became 0.70 which was in the acceptable range. Therefore, the careerism measure just kept 3 items in practice. Though the Cronbach’s of transactional psychological contract was lower than 0.70 slightly, it could be accepted Then we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 16.0 to confirm the existence of the three psychological contract types. We used CMIN/DF, CFI, GFI and RMSEA as key indicators of overall model fit. Values of less than or equal to 5 on the CMIN/DF, greater than or equal to 0.90 on the GFI CFI, less than or equal to 0.08 on the RMSEA indicate good fit 21   T h e C F A y i el de d ac ce pt abl e f i t i n di c e s  C M I N  D F  2  48   CFI=0.94; GFI=0.90; RMSEA=0.057.

The control variables were entered in step 1 of the equation. These included gender, education level, age, total tenure, tenure of current job, and times of converting jobs. Here it was necessary to point out that two dummy variables were introduced to represent bachelor degree and master degree of education level respectively Hypotheses 1a and 2a were tested by regressing transactional psychological contract on the control variables equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1b and 2b were tested by regressing balanced psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Hypotheses 1c and 2c were tested by regressing relational psychological contract on the control variables, equity sensitivity and careerism. Whether hypotheses were confirmed was through observing regression coefficients of equity sensitivity and careerism separately As Table 2 shows, equity sensitivity was positively related to transactional psychological contract 0.342, P 0.01 negatively related to balanced psychological contract 0.205, P 0.01\nd not related to relational psychological contract 0.006\. From Table 2, we can also see that careerism was positively related to two psychological contract dimensions - transactional psychological contract 0.185, P 0.01\ and balanced psychological contract 0.095, P 0.05\nd negatively related to relational psychological contract  0.245, P 0.01\herefore, hypothesis 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 2c were all supported and hypothesis 1c was not confirmed TABLE II  REGRESSION  RESULTS  PREDICTING  THREE  TYPES  OF  PSYCHOLOGICAL  CONTRACT  Transactional psychological contract   Balanced psychological contract  Relational psychological contract  Step 1 Gender 0.007 0.069 0.048 0.047 0.025 0.042 Diploma 1 0.096 0.091 -0.022 0.052 -0.190 0.102 Diploma 2 0.061 0.064 -0.021 0.049 -0.215 -0.137 Age 0.055 0.008 -0.067 0.059 0.027 -0.004 Total tenure 0.063 0.075 -0.016 -0.026 0.030 0.012 Tenure of current job 0.091 0.017 0.002 0.039 0.036 0.072 Times of converting jobs 0.020 0.005 0.037 -0.033 -0.089 -0.103 R 2  0.018 0.007  0.021 Step 2 Equity sensitivity  0.342 0.205 0.006 Careerism 0.185**  0.095*  -0.245 R 2   0.204 0.112  0.115 p<.05   **<.01     


VII  D ISCUSSION  This study served t following purpose: studying the relationships between individual differences and psychological contracts using knowledge employees as research participants 5 of 6 hypotheses were confirmed The only unconfirmed hypothesis is that equity sensitivity is negatively related to relational psychological contract. The result showed that they were not related. The reasons can be explained below. As discussed above, relational psychological contracts are based upon mutual trust and loyalty and express employees’ positive affections for their organizations However, employees high on equity sensitivity have a preference to calculate what they get and give in employment relationships and care for them very much. That is to say equity sensitivity is rather a rational construct whose relationship with affection-related factors is not close. The score on equity sensitivity is unable to influence the affections that employees have for their organizations. Moreover, social desirability may weaken the relationship between equity sensitivity and relational psychological contract when employees answer the questionnaires Finally, it is important to point out the study’s limitations The biggest problem of this study is that data were collected at a single point in time. Thus, the use of cross-sectional research design limits the ability to make firm conclusions about cause and effect among variables in the study. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm the conclusions drawn by this study R EFERENCE  1  G. D.

 6  dust storm three sol plan with a three sol plan at the height of the storm The REM temperatures on both rovers were significantly reduced as a byproduct of the reduced activity level  The power and thermal engineers estimated that the REM heaters would use a minimum of 200Whrs before the REM reached an acceptable temperature  To reduce unexpected power consumption, the REM heaters on both vehicles were disabled To prevent the REM from reaching too low of a temperature the internal temperature was maintained by increasing the awake duration each sol  The initial awake duration of 45 minutes was not able to reverse the cooling of the REM.  An awake duration of 1 hour did stabilize the REM temperature and required approximately 40Whrs The low power fault mode was also modified to minimize power consumption  The awake time for the low power fault mode was reduced to 30 minutes.  The low power fault communication windows were shortened to 20 minutes in duration and set to receive only.  This change eliminates the use of power for transmission  The transmission of telemetry direct to Earth can be initiated by a real time comma nd  As the storm began to weaken activity levels on both vehicles were increased while maintaining a positive power profile.  The REM heaters and low power fault states were reverted to their original settings after the storm had mostly dissipated 4  L ES SONS L EARNED FOR S PIRIT 325 S T HIRD M ARTIAN W INTER  Multi-sol limited activity planning developed during the dust storm formed the basis of the strategy to allow Spirit to survive its third Martian winter  Power levels were expected to drop to approximately 150Whr per sol and temperatures were expected to cause all survival heaters to be activated A strategy was developed where Spirit would only support UHF relay downlinks every fourth sol.  To further conserve power the UHF communication sessions were shortened from 15 minutes to 6 minutes Each plan would last three four or seven sols  The sequences for each plan would be uplinked via the high-gain antenna HGA two sols prior to the start of the plan Uplinking on the sol before plan kickoff was provided as a backup.  This planning strategy was only possible due to the confidence in the modeling tools acquired during the dust storms  Table 1 - Opportunity Pre-Dust Storm \(Sols 1152-1154 and Dust Storm \(Sols 1237-1239\ Three Sol Plans Sol 1152  245  X Band Uplink  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES Sky & Ground  245  Pancam 3x1 mosaic  245  Pancam of target Jaen  245  M iniTES stares at targets Badajos, Castellon Coruna, Rioja, & Jaen  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  UHF Downlink  245  APXS Argon measurement  245  Nap  245  Mini Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam sky survey  245  Nap  245  Navcam bitty cloud  245  MiniTES sky and ground   Sol 1237  245  X Band Uplink  245  Nap  245  D eep Sleep  Sol 1153  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  Drive  245  Post drive imaging  245  Navcam 5x1  245  Post drive Pancam  245  Nap  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & gound   Sol 1238  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap   Sol 1154  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  MiniTES gro und stares  245  Pancam Tau  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  Pancam sky spot  245  Navcam bitty cloud  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  Nap  245  MiniTES sky and ground  Sol 1239  245  Nap  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  


 7  5  C ONCLUSION  A combination of historical data on tau values during planet encircling dust storms, combined with realtime observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars and the resourcefulness of the science and engineering teams led to the survival of both of the Mars Exploration Rovers.  The techniques and strategies developed have influenced operations of both vehicles as the mission continues.  The strategies developed during the dust storm were highly influential in the survival of the Spirit rover during its third Martian winter Both rovers continue to operate on the Martian surface Spirit is resuming more normal operations as spring approaches.  Opportunity is departing Victoria crater, which it entered immediately after the 2007 dust storm, to begin a trek towards Endeavor Crater 12km to the Southeast It is hoped that the lessons learned from the continued operation of these two rovers will provide valuable lessons that can be applied to future surface explorations of Mars and other planets and moons 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The work described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in support of the continued operation of the Mars Exploration Rovers The authors would like to acknowledge Jake Matijevic, the MER Spacecraft/Rover Engineering Team Chief for his detailed notes kept during the dust storms as well as his expertise and contributions to operation of both rovers The authors thank and acknowledge Mark Lemmon professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M, and Brue Cantor Mars meteorologist at Malin Space Science Systems for his scientific insight and numerous technical discussions The authors would also like to acknowledge the entire MER team for their successful efforts that allowed both vehicles to survive the dust storm R EFERENCES  1   M a r t i n   L   J    P   B   J a m e s   A   D o l l f u s   K   I w a s a k i  a n d  J   D Beish Telescopic Observations  Visual Photographic Polarimetric, in Mars edited by H.

6.2 Results  Figure 2 shows the overall average results of the BIA maturity assessments of the Belgium and Dutch participants. From this graph, some differences are immediately clear, specifically for skills  governance and scope and architecture Figure 3 shows the results on a deeper level. Based upon these differences, the following analysis can be made  Communications maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.0 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants do not show a lot of difference, also on the level of the individual assessment items shown in Figure 3. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Value measurement maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.7 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable show some difference. On the more detailed level, a substantial difference is shown on the item Formal assessments reviews The direction of the difference, however, is opposite to the expectation. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Governance maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.4 On this variable of BIA maturity, the results show the expected difference that the Belgium participants score higher than the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that especially the prioritization process is scored significantly different The expected difference is therefore confirmed  Partnership maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.2 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable are equal. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Scope & Architecture maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.3 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.8 For this variable the expectation was undecided. The results show a remarkably higher score of the Belgium participants than of the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level this difference shows on all items  Skills maturity Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 For this variable, the results show the expected difference that the Dutch participants score a higher maturity than the Belgium participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that this difference shows on all items, but most strongly on Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness The expected difference is confirmed  Table 5 shows the summary of the results of this exploratory study    0,00 0,50 1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00 3,50 4,00 4,50 5,00 Und e rstand i ng of b u sines s by IT Und ers tand ing of I T b y bu si n e ss Inte r/I ntraorg aniz ati onal lea rn ing K now led ge S ha rin g I T Metr i cs Business Metric s Bal a nc ed M et ric s Formal Assessments/Revie ws Conti n uous Im proveme n Budgetar y Cont r o l IT inves tm ent m a nage m en P riorit iz ation pr oces s Busin e ss per c eption o f IT val ue S hared  goals r isk, re w ards p e nalt i e s Re lat ions hip trus t st yl e Sta nd a rds Ar t iculatio n Ar chit ectu ral inte grat io n D isr upti on from Ch ang es Inn o vation  Entre p reneu rs hip Loc us of Po w er Cha n ge rea d ines s Ab i lity to attract a n d reta i n Netherlands Belgium Communications maturity Value measurement maturity Governance maturity Partnership maturity Scope & Architecture maturity Skills maturity  Figure 3.

Conclusions and limitations  The conceptual analysis of the potential influence of national cultures on BIA maturity provides indications that this influence is indeed more than likely and that its influence is consistent over the different dimensions of culture. Our first empirical exploration provided support for the existence of differences in BIA maturity between countries. More specifically, the differences in scores regarding the alignment domains governance maturity and skills maturity could be explained by Hofstede s cultural differences studies, with governance maturity scoring higher in Belgium and skills maturity scoring better in the Netherlands. One a more detailed level, it was expected and confirmed that the portfolio management process received better in Belgium and that Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness clearly received better scores in the Netherlands Our study did not, however, confirm all expected results. The domains communications maturity  value measurement maturity and partnership maturity did not show the difference in scores that were expected. In fact, the scores showed no clear substantial at all. A potential explanation for this result could be the small sample size. Therefore, further study should be made, based on larger samples, to further explore and study the impact of cultural differences on business and IT alignment scores. Such studies can expand the comparison between Belgian and Dutch results, but could also address cultural differences between other nations worldwide  References  1  A VOLIO   B  K AHAI   S    D ODGE   G. \(2000 E-leadership Implications for theory, research, and practice Leadership Quarterly, 11 \(4\, 615-668 2] B ATENBURG R. \(2007 E-procurement adoption by European Firms: A quantative analysis Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 13, 182-192 3  B IRGELEN   M VAN   R UYTER   K.D  J ONG   A.D    W TZELS M 2002 Customer evaluations of after-sale service contact modes An empirical analysis of national culture's consequences  International Journal of Research in Marketing, 19, 43-64 4  B OND M.H. \(1984 Hofstede's Culture Dimensions ; An Independent Validation Using Rokeach's Value Survey Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, Vol. 15, No. 4, 417-433 5  C HAN   Y.E  H UFF   S.L  B ARCLAY   D.W AND C OPELAND D.G 1997 Business Strategy Orientation, Information Systems Orientation and Strategic Alignment Information Systems Research, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 125-150 6  C HAN   Y.E. \(2002 Why Haven t we Mastered Alignment?

Automated Windowed Coefficient Trending Earlier we attempted to find explanatory models whose coefficients changed over time in a predictable way This would then let us predict future coefficient values for these models and apply these trended models towards future estimates The problem was that we were not able to find such stable models at least manually We automated our search for stable models by building a system we refer to as the Automated Coefficient Trend Search ACTS tool A patent is currently pending for the method implemented in this software Against the Far Out data set ACTS is designed to automatically permute fields run chronologically-windowed regressions with the chosen fields establish linear and nonlinear trends for the resulting coefficients and then use these trended coefficients to estimate a future set of data ACTS also automatically tries up to seven different transformations on any given dependant or independent variable The length of calibration windows and the increment between them are automatically varied ACTS establishes most promising coefficient trends and also rates the performance of predictions done using trended-coefficient models With so many parameters transformations windows length and intervals to evaluate ACTS needed to search a huge problem space Despite assembling a cluster of 8 computers to run ACTS if necessary for months the problem still required pruning Each run of ACTS was therefore restricted to producing models with a different number of variables between 3 and 15 We quickly found that the best models contained very few parameters due to over-fitting on wider models permitting us to pare down the problem Neural Netv 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 I  M The system produced literally thousands of forecasts for each project If the distribution of project costs and project costs estimates were known a confidence interval could be computed using the cost estimates and a method such as Bayesian model averaging used to integrate them 5 Not having a priori knowledge of this distribution we chose instead to use the inter-quartile range of the estimates that is we looked at whether the estimate fell between the first and third quartile of the estimates The top and bottom 25 were disregarded because there are always outliers and it was presumed the system could work well even when many of the individual estimates were not very good Given the very large number of estimates produced by the system literally thousands or tens of thousands depending on the settings we could afford to squander a few Results were best with only three variables per equation In eight out of 31 projects 26 of the projects the project's actual costs fell within the inter-quartile range of the forecasts of costs for that project produced by the ACTS models For 30 out of 31 projects the inter-quartile range of estimates was made up of over a thousand estimates while for the 3 1st project only 446 estimates were part of the inter-quartile range The significance of these numbers is revealed in the next paragraph When equations with four variables were used only one of the true project costs fell within the inter-quartile range of forecasts produced by ACTS When more than 4 variables were used none of the true project costs fell within the interquartile range From this we concluded that ACTS performed best when only 3 variables were included in each model Using more variables appears to produce over-fitted models Aork MRE By Lauch Month Chronologic 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Launch Month Since 1960 Figure 10 Neural network magnitude of relative error sorted chronologically 11 space 


incapable of accurate forecasts Of course the wider the inter-quartile range of forecasts the more likely it is that the true forecast will fit within that range But how parsimonious is the range As figure 11 shows in about 55\2600 of the inter-quartile ranges created by ACTS the 3rd quartile of estimates is 50%0 larger than the Ist quartile of estimates For about 90\2600 of the ranges created the difference between the I't and 3rd quartile is less than 75\2600 and for 97\2600 of the projects the top of the range is 100 or less than the bottom of the range 45\2600 of the true project costs falling into the new range When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 50\2600 the range estimates encompassed 77\2600 of the true project costs In the end however we felt that the adjusted ranges were too wide for practical use Adaboosting using binomial logit classifiers Short for adaptive boosting the Adaboost algorithm 6 is a type of machine learning algorithm where a set of classifiers are adjusted to favor previous misclassifications These classifiers are actually other estimating algorithms Percentage of Time 3rd Quartile no more than XO/o Greater than 1st Quartile 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 25 50 75 100 Figure 11 Variation in ACTS-produced estimates measured between 3rd and 1st quartile Percentage of time True Cost Falls in Range Produced by ACTS 3 variable ersion 90 8070 60 5040 30 20 10 l 0 Interquartile  or10  or25  or50  or75 Figure 12 The effect of widening the estimating range measured by  of estimates now lying within Of the eight projects that fell within the average percentage difference between the 1st and 3rd quartile was 55 with median of 52 This indicated that the inter-quartile range might be too restrictive We therefore proceeded to widen the range of cost estimates for each project multiplying the ISt quartile estimate by 1 X%0 and the 3rd quartile estimate by 1  X using various Xs In each instance we compared actual project costs to estimates produced and determined how frequently the actual fell into the range of estimates Results are summarized in figure 12 When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 10 32 of the actual estimates fell within the new range Extending each of the range boundaries by 25 resulted in Adaboost works by iteratively weighting observations so that poorly classified ones are given more weight during the next iteration With the algorithm focused on improving estimates for exceptional cases it is somewhat more sensitive to noisy data and outliers though less likely to over fit We chose to test this approach due to the latter property The boosting algorithm seemed structured particularly for binary decisions though we are seeking to estimate a continuous variable cost We therefore staged the method by estimating cost bands so that the estimate for each band reverted to a binary decision The algorithm would separately estimate whether an observation was 12 


our evaluation method tested potential models using either ordinary least squares least absolute above or below X dollars then Y dollars then Z such that instead namely that we were examining a proportion rather X  Y  Z than a binary outcome but this was impractical to use and we judged that the problem was not strongly biased towards The boosting algorithm still required a classifier and model either context For a classifier we implemented binary logit78 a discrete Adaboost MRE By COST Lu was similar to ACTS but with 0 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 2 00 Cost Figure 13 Adaboost magnitude of relative error sorted by actual cost Adaboost MRE CHRONOLOGICALLY Year Figure 14 Adaboost magnitude of relative error sorted chronologically choice model specifically intended for a binary dependant variable is the cost above or below this point There may have been some support for using the probit model 7 This was done by a statistical programmer with output checked against the statistics program STATA 8 we obtained from this first stage system We also attempted to use OLS as a classifier but our experiments showed no significant effect from adding relatively orthogonal i.e unrelated models Since using more than one model did not make a difference boosting using OLS was little more than a single OLS model with estimates divvied up in bands no dynamic re-weighting of classifiers and thus no boosting effect to speak of To obtain models some changes and improvements and again put were discarded and resolved by the latter 13 Lu 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0 0.50 0.75 1 00 1.25 1 50 1 75 2 00 error which better discounts outliers and weighted least squares The models which we built another windowed test system that our computing cluster to use trying to find good ones from were then used to bootstrap the binary logit method although coefficients a sea of potential transformations This time 


This exercise required a number of decisions about how many classifiers to use how many bands to estimate and how many variables should be used in the models All these choices were made empirically Models with 3 variables were marginally more accurate than those with 4 More models seemed generally better to a point so we used 99 models We also used 22 cost bands checking whether an estimate was above or below 12M 35M 44M and so on through 519M It is interesting to note that there was no data scarcity-induced limit on the number of bands we could have used since each was estimated using all observations lying above and below and not just between bands As with the neural network training was carried out using 52 missions from the 1960s through 1996 and testing occurred on 58 missions from 1996 through 2007 The trend in estimate deviation would again permit us to gauge whether predictive accuracy decayed over time Results are shown sorted by cost in figure 13 and chronologically in figure 14 Figure 13 shows that MREs are large and negative for missions at 56M actual mission cost and below Above this point results are mixed although not as poor as at the very low range There seems to be no degradation in predictive accuracy as projects increase in scale The correlation between estimates and actual values is approximately 0.66 Sorted chronologically in figure 14 no trend can be seen as estimates go farther out up to 11 years as was seen with the neural network Again this may have been due to the normalization process in which we mapped each variable to its percentage ranking based on future and past minimum and maximum values basically embedding the effect of time within the factors being input to the model It also may be due to a relatively stable era Weighted combinations of simple models A persistent problem in multivariate estimation methods which has been mentioned is that a model may be produced that over fits the observations used for calibration It would thus not be adequately generalized to estimate out of that sample Techniques such as jack-knifing and outlier removal can mitigate this We chose another approach developing models that were little more than simple rules of thumb and then combining these in a weighted manner so each would have a say in the estimate The weightings were formulated using Excel's Solver to minimize estimation error on a set observations lying 15 to 25 years before the test set We refer to this method as continuous boosting because as with the Adaboost method it too involves a mix of classifiers that are combined according to their performance against a set of test observations Unlike Adaboost which solves a binary problem the algorithms are here estimating on a continuous scale Also unlike Adaboost the models are re-weighted rather than the observations to maximize prediction Before presenting results it is worth noting that we ran a control test where all variables from the simple rules of thumb were combined into a single model and run on the same windows performance was nowhere near as good We chose the models by hand guided by the criteria that they should be relatively orthogonal rely on differing parameters so they could each contribute a unique influence to the combined result Figure 15 shows that MREs are mostly positive though for lower cost missions errors are regularly negative and large Continuous Boost MRE By COST M M 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Cost Figure 15 Continuous boosting magnitude of relative error sorted by actual cost 14 


CONCLUSIONS Given that this project was intended to estimate missions lying 10-15 years out we structured it differently than one intended to estimate contemporary projects A variety of conventional techniques were not used as we felt they would over fit training observations and thus not be suitable for prediction We also were not sure which approach would work so we tried many We heavily favored ensemble methods where models are combined because we surmised that any one model could not be guaranteed to have the best view of the future However a single neural network ultimately yielded the most competitive results Another finding was that methods built upon simple models such as with three variables generally did work best not surprisingly because they were less likely to over fit calibration data A graph of the three best methods is shown in figure 18 with estimates for the same missions sorted by cost For the neural network calibration occurred until just before the results shown for continuous boosting calibration occurred no more recently than 15 years prior to the results and for Adaboost calibration also occurred up until the results shown A graph sorted by year is not shown we think it instructive that no results seemed to degrade over time As mentioned but obvious from figure 17 the neural network performs best followed by Adaboost and then continuous boosting It is interesting to note that the three cases in which the neural network goes haywire and predicts too low also correspond to worst performances for the Adaboost method pointing to exceptional data points We will be further investigating these regularly errant results and other outliers which may result in estimating improvements ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was carried out under Small Business Innovation Research contract FS9453-05-C-0023 with the Air Force Research Lab The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge Judy Fennelly and later Ross Wainwright our technical points of contact at AFRL for their continuous support and encouragement Our contract officer Timothy Provencio also provided invaluable assistance Our critical seed stock of data was provided by Joseph Hamaker who previously was Director of NASA Headquarters Cost Analysis Division and now is Senior Cost Analyst with SAIC Ainsley Chong and Dale Martin USAF Ret also lent considerable assistance with data gathering APPENDIX A MISSIONS COLLECTED Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Satellite Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer Adeos Advanced Communications Technology Satellite Advanced Composition Explorer Alexis Amos-I AMSC-1 Anik El Anik E2 Applications Technology Satellite-I Applications Technology Satellite-2 Applications Technology Satellite-5 All MREs Lu 1.00 0.75 l 0.50l 0.25 l 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75-2.00oi v 1   Cost o N X  X~~~~~Cl Figure 16 Comparison of estimating error for three best methods 15
