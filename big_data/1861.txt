ground Moreover they give little information about the rover's heading Absolute heading information can be cal\255 culated from digital compass readings but the most likely targets for rover exploration i.e the moon and Mars do not have useful magnetic fields Measuring the sun direction with a high-accuracy sun sensor is an effective means of obtaining absolute orientation and thereby reducing the drift in naviga\255 tion accuracy during autonomous navigation 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00 2512009 IEEE IEEEAC Paper 1340 Version 2.0 Updated 9 January 2009 Paul Furgale Tim Barfoot Institute for Aerospace Studies University of Toronto Toronto ON M3H5T6 416-667 7700 paul.furgale,tim.barfoot 
utoronto.ca This paper examines the problem of rover navigation with the aid of sun sensors We outline the mathematical basis of our heading and position determination and evaluate the algorithms on data collected through a number of field tri\255 als conducted in the summer of 2008 Tests were conducted at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies UTIAS and on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic as part the Haughton-Mars Project The Devon Island terrain is a popular analog to the Martian surface and represents a good environment to evaluate rover navigation performance Tests were conducted using a 
Sinclair Interplanetary SS-411 digital sun sensor and a suite of conventional rover sensors mounted on a mobile platform The paper is organized as follows First we review prior work on sun sensors for planetary rovers Next we present the the\255 oretical development of our algorithms to determine both ab\255 solute rover heading and absolute global position We then provide the details of our field testing campaign and experi\255 mental results A conclusion follows 2 PRIOR WORK The inclusion of a sun sensor on future rover mISSIons was one of the recommendations coming out of the 1997 
Mars Pathfinder mission 1 This recommendation was im\255 plemented on the 2004 Mars Exploration Rovers MERs Eisenman et al 2 describe the method the MERs use to transform PanCam images into sun vectors They do not de\255 scribe the method of solving for orientation given the sun vec\255 tors Ali et al 3 also describe the uses of sun sensing on the MERs The MERs use sun sensing in two different ways i to update the heading of the rover and ii to update the full attitude of the rover which is used to point the high gain an\255 tenna The 
algorithms are not described although they say that they use QUEST and cite Schuster and Oh 4 Ac\255 curacy of the technique is not reported We treat a similar problem in our Experiment 2 Heading from Sun and Posi\255 tion below Maimone et ale 5 report that As of January 2007 sun-locating commands have run more than 100 times on each rover Kuroda et al 6 describe a lunar global/local localization method using sun vectors and Earth vectors They perform simulations and find that using sun and Earth vectors alone they are able to estimate their global position on the moon to 


Frames of Reference Co So deflection of the vertical Hence the transformation of a vector is written 1 It is often convenient to express frame transformations as a series of principal axis rotations Using the shorthand within 0.5 km The authors develop a method of linking con\255 secutive global localization readings using dead-reckoning They claim that this method increases the accuracy of the esti\255 mation to within 150 m The authors do not report any results of hardware experiments nor do they include a model of in\255 clinometer error in their simulations It should be noted for the purpose of comparison with our global position results that the radius of the planetary body effects the accuracy of localization i.e a smaller radius results in a more accurate estimate Several IPL studies have also used rover-based sun sensing Volpe 7 describes the field testing of the relative localiza\255 tion system on the Rocky 7 field rover The sun sensor head\255 ing determination scheme limits the cross-track error to linear growth as the rover travels Trebi-Ollennu et ale 8 describe the design and testing of a sun sensor on one of the FIDO rover platforms at IPL They report errors in rover heading of a few degrees which is comparable to our Experiments 1 and 2 below Sigel and Wettergreen 9 perform some mathe\255 matical modeling and simulation for localization on the moon using a star tracker They comment that the major source of error is the inclinometer They also comment that the effect of the local gravity model on moon localization using this method should be negligible Deans et al 10 develop a sun sensor based on a fisheye\255 lens firewire camera and an inclinometer bundled together They describe their frames of reference the calibration pro\255 cedure for the system and plot inclinometer and image resid\255 uals after calibration To find orientation they use a weighted least-squares cost function which they optimize using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm They assume their position on the planetary body is known These assumptions are sim\255 ilar to the ones we make in our Experiment 1 Heading from Sun Gravity and Position Deans et ale state The sensor orientation is estimated to within a fraction of a degree but we lack a simple and independent method for measuring the ground truth orientation with similar precision The issue of ground-truth heading particularly in a remote field setting is a challenge that we attempt to address in the current paper Deans et al also state Results for position estimation for long traverses is beyond the scope of this paper since position error depends on the fusion of multiple sources of informa\255 tion These results will be reported elsewhere The current paper provides some preliminary results on estimating global position using a sun sensor Experiment 3 Pingyuan et al 11 describe a method of attitude determina\255 tion on the moon using sun Earth and gravity vectors They formulate the problem similarly to the current paper and also use the F experiment Cab a  cos  and  sin  our notational convention defines the S b is always less than 0.01 260[13 we assume that gravity is also normal to the reference Earth el\255 lipsoid The remaining three frames are defined with respect to the sun sensor inclinometer and camera housings respec\255 tively For this study we consider to be the primary exter\255 nal frame and Xb read as the rotation from which are described below q-method Working with vector observations is an exercise in frame transformations In order to see how our sensor observations are related to predictions we must understand the reference frames in which they are made Six reference frames are of particular importance to this study Table 1 The Earth\255 Centred Inertial ECI and Earth Centred Fixed ECF frame follow standard definitions Rover heading and motion is best understood relative to the local topocentric frame This frame is defined with respect to the local horizontal Strictly speak\255 ing gravity is measured normal to the geoid but since the Subscripts denote the frame of reference for the vector All of our vector transformations are rotations captured in transformation matrices of the form to solve for attitude They test their sys\255 tem on one simulated traverse and conclude that their method will estimate orientation This is similar to our Experiment 1 Heading from Sun Gravity and Position except that in Pingyuan et al it is assumed the starting global position i.e latitude/longitude is known and propagated through an 2 odometry relative position estimate as the rover moves This allows the global position to be known each time heading is estimated during the traverse Cozman and Krotkov 12 also use the circles of equal alti\255 tude method to solve for the position of a sun sensor The authors develop a sun sensor using a camera and inclinome\255 ter Altitude values are corrected for parallax and refraction They minimize a least-squares cost function using a grid of initial guesses keeping the best lowest error solution They perform two experiments that are based on only two sun ob\255 servations each They report inclinometer as a major source of error Their results are comparable to our Experiment 3 Position and Heading from Sun and Gravity 3 MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK This section provides the mathematical framework for the analysis used in this paper We first define the key frames of reference used in our measurements explain the calculation of the predicted vectors and then solve for the rover orienta\255 tion that best matches the observations We also consider how sensor data can be combined in different ways to solve for the relevent set of unknowns Each configuration effectively

encouraged to express more personal judgments about the three scenarios. Electronic meeting technology supported electronic discourse on the question ?What is it like to live in Auckland under scenarios 1, 2 and 3?? In Churchman?s inquiring system, participants were being asked to drop their usual role of designer and adopt the role of client [5 The goal was disclosure of speaker?s subjectivity unconstrained by the \(technical model and unrestrained by the interpersonal context The strategy was to get each individual to write a personalized account of what it would be like to live in Auckland 30 years hence under each of options 1 2 and 3, then to read the account of others to identify the most valuable visions. The procedure was a 60minute silent envisioning exercise in which each account is identified only by a code. Anonymity was almost complete  Table 6.

Their selfabsorbed silence contrasted strongly with the shouted social consensus that accompanied the reading of the account of others. The most valued visions of what it would be like to live in Auckland 30 years hence showed intense personal support for scenario one, a lack of engagement with scenario two, and a willingness to work against scenario three. \(Table 6  Decision Outcome: Under the norms of disclosure of speakers? subjectivity, 14 of the 16 participants will, in all truthfulness, only support Option 1  5.5. Summary  The positive results obtained from the meeting are in strong contrast to the confusion and conflict that existed at the end of the pre-meeting phase Participants? perceptions and performance as a result of the electronic meeting technology were positive Participants were satisfied. These findings are similar to those in the meta-analysis reported in [28]. While some participants were reluctant to attend the focal meeting, and expressed negative views at the beginning of the meeting, all participants provided positive evaluations at the end of the meeting. The functionality of the GSS software was supportive of an overall positive result. Participation by all participants was intense. By the end of the meeting electronic discourse produced 80 pages of text 


electronic discourse produced 80 pages of text Intense participation in four key aspects of electronic discourse resulted in each of the three decision outcomes being documented and coherently linked to the relevant underlying validity claim. The data gathered during the focal meeting support the claim that the combination of Habermasian inquiry and electronic discourse were successful in reducing conflict and confusion The empirical evidence is that each of the knowledge perspectives \(technical, interpersonal and personal capturing phenomena important to the success of the focal electronically-supported meeting. The focal electronically-supported meeting enabled a critical examination of claims to valid technical interpersonal and personal knowledge. Observations confirm that the decision outcome in each knowledge world was grounded in the corresponding validity claim - truth, rightness or truthfulness. It is not clear however, that the electronically-supported meeting integrated the technical, inter-personal, and personal perspectives into a consensus model that provides the rationale for action  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 6. After the meeting  A ?valid? and ?coherent? evaluation of the three scenario plans is desired. The meeting succeeded in documenting technical, interpersonal and personal decision outcomes and grounded in the relevant underlying validity claim. We have yet to consider the degree of coherence among the three perspectives. Participants found no difference between the scenarios on the basis of technical knowledge. Moderate claims in favor of scenario one were made based on interpersonal knowledge. Strong claims in favor of scenario one were made based on personal knowledge The degree of coherence among the decision outcomes at different levels is poor. There is a major discrepancy in preferences at various stages of the decision process. The 80-page report generated by electronic meeting technology \(from which the data in tables 4, 5 and 6 are extracted participants immediately after the meeting. The introductory section of the report highlighted the fact that the participants were strongly supportive of an option that lacked factual support. The report became subject to intense scrutiny. Regional planners met repeatedly among themselves about the report and consulted other meeting participants. Support grew for the interpretation that the information in Table 4 should be taken at face value ? scenario options were not extreme enough. In Hegelian terms, the dialectical logic \(synthesis initially lost on the regional planners because they were so firmly wedded to their decision framework thesis recognizing that the framework itself was flawed antithesis subsequently undertaken with more extreme variations on scenarios one and three \(based on a 100% increase in population for scenario one at technical, interpersonal and personal levels  6.1. Discussion  Support has been found that framing the 


Support has been found that framing the electronic discourses as an instance Habermasian inquiry reduces participants? conflict and confusion about a comprehensive urban plan and preferences for three scenario options. The meeting enabled bounds to rationality to be loosened by active testing of each participant?s knowledge against other points of view. Intense scrutiny of the meeting report produced a significant increase in the coherence of the belief structure of meeting participants Specifically, the apparent contradictions in preferences surfaced at different stages of the meeting served as a precursor to a Hegelian synthesis. Participants? insight that the model was flawed led to a consensus model that provided decision makers with a rationale for action. Using the definition of success in Churchman?s inquiring system \(?insight leading to a consensus model that provides decision makers with a rationale for action  6.2. Conclusion  The paper applies Habermasian inquiry to electronic discourse in group decision, and the strategic evaluation of a comprehensive urban plan In this case at least, the combination of Habermasian inquiry and electronic discourse led to the overall success of a key meeting. The learning process did not produce a coherent decision based on the initial parameters in the planning model, but an appreciation of the gap between the model and the purpose for which it had been developed. After the meeting consensus developed around a new urban planning model synthesized from suggestions by meeting participants. Ten years after the electronicallysupported meeting, the essence of the decision in favor of scenario one remains the accepted plan for the future of the Auckland region In totality, the empirical evidence suggests that the combination of Habermasian inquiry and electronic discourses enhance participant?s trust and understanding in scenario planning. Seen as an instance of Habermasian inquiry, the benefits of the electronically-supported meeting were three-fold Technical perspective. Support for the development and documentation of validity claims about objective truth, rightness and personal truthfulness or sincerity, and the degree of coherence among them Interpersonal perspective. Support for discourse that interweaves evidence \(reflections and experiences, decisions and actions, theories and interpretations, individual feelings and objective facts supportive evaluative frames Personal perspective. Support for the psychological safety? and ?trust? needed for direct and unreserved expressions of multiple, conflicting individual perspectives This retrospective inquiry was initially born out of a personal concern that the subjectivist story-telling aspects of the design of the GSS session could not be justified, and that harm may result. This appears not to be the case. Retrospective inquiry has enabled this GSS facilitator to find that his intuitions about Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 session design are shared by others. Several lessons have been learned. Firstly, in theory and in practice creativity and conflict are intertwined. An element of self expression via story-telling may get us closer to 


the truth than available empirical data. Secondly, in practice, individual and group knowledge is mediated and situated, provisional and pragmatic, aspirational and contested. In this case at least, a broad but robust theory of electronic discourse proved useful in teasing out intertwined technical, interpersonal and personal issues. Thirdly, GSS technology has a raw power that the facilitator may direct via the application of this theory. The author has found the architecture of Habermasian discourses a useful archetype for mid-range operational models in various domains. Finally, the methodology of a critical interpretive case study is recommended for critiquing the support provided by collaborative technologies in situations involving dissensus. Such an approach is required to study why participants are inauthentic in their participation in collaboration technologies, or avoid them completely as communication closes down in response to unresolved conflict. The application of ideas about pragmatism and systemic intervention provides a practice model that extends the practical and decisionistic applications of critical research in information systems, and places positivist technology-based theories of collaborative design in the context of power relations In practice, interaction on problematic issues is subject to confusion and conflict. However these are the experiences required to disambiguate a mess of facts, norms and feelings. Seen from a Hegelian perspective, the power of a design theory for collaborative technologies based on Habermasian discourses, lies not in achievement of enlightenment but in appreciation of the nature of ignorance, and the practical consequences of belief  7.

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
