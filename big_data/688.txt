4.3 Subgraph re-construction To re-construct a subgraph a query with QID is sent to all data nodes with related data objects which means the data object matches the query in any query constraint in tag label term or content Then a map-reduce procedure is conducted to form the subgraph as follows Map Map all matched data objects o i to  QID o i   in which QID is the key Reduce All o i s are collected so that a subgraph can be reconstructed by join the target of pointers with data object IDs 4.4 Enhancement The basic storage index and reconstruction procedure introduced above may encounter serious performance issue First some data objects are hot ones that point to or are pointed by a large number of other data objects Thus data nodes storing these hot objects may be overloaded Second for some complex tasks that need to re-construct a large subgraph the node that conduct the reduce phase for the query QID may be overloaded or it may take long time to 002nish the job DisG uses several techniques to distribute the storage or computation burden to different data nodes 1 For hot data objects with large amount of out-pointers each of them are mapped to a set of virtual data objects all of which are connected to each other Pointers are distributed evenly to those virtual objects The pointers between virtual objects are not resolved in subgraph re-construction until last 2 For hot data objects with large amount of in-pointers they are identi\002ed in index construction after the grouping following the 002rst mapping phase Again the long list of f  label j  ID j g is splitted and distributed to several data nodes so that the second procedure can be conducted more ef\002ciently Furthermore data node containing p i are informed to construct virtual data objects for p i  3 While re-construct subgraphs data objects are not exchanged until last Only ID of data objects and a list of IDs in broken pointers which means pointers whose target data objects are not stored locally are exchanged between data nodes in the grouping of mapreduce Thus the sketch of the result subgraph is 002rst built The real subgraph is constructed at last This may greatly reduce the network consumption 4 The mapping phase of subgraph reconsutrution does not map all data objects to the same QID  It partitions all data objects into several partitions For each partition DisG generates a QID i  All data objects whose ID belongs to that partition or their broken pointers point to data objects in that partition are mapped to the QID i  Thus the computational burden of subgraph reconstruction is distributed 5 Resulting subgraphs are cached in DisG Queries that generate these subgraphs are hashed and used as keys of subgraphs 5 Related work TLGM is similar to W and W ebOQL[1 W ebSQL and WebOQL are two query languages for access of Web data WebSQL are designed to represent hyperlinks of web pages Web pages can be accessed via SQL-like queries by providing query conditions on hyperlinks WebOQL further extends WebSQL so that web pages themselves are represented as a hypertrees Hypertrees are further linked via hyperlinks link WebSQL OQL-like query language is used for retrieval and reconstruction of Web data Similar to W ebSQL and W ebOQL TLGM accepts high-level descriptive queries as description on required services The difference is that in TLGM tags timestamps and content are used as query conditions Traditional centralized storage is not scalable enough for storing web data with huge volume Large-scale distributed storage systems are often chosen as a solution for this kind of tasks Cooperative File System P AST 14 and OceanStore are designed for storing 002les in distrib uted systems without coordinators They rely on Distributed Hash Table DHT protocols namely Google File System GFS is a system that uses centralized 002le lookup yet decentralized data access GFS is designed for applications with huge amount of parallel access to large 002les such as search engines And it is reported to be very ef\002cient and scalable DisG focuses on the problem of ho w to tak e advantage of such kind of distributed storage to manage complex data Map-reduce is a programming model for data intensive computing in large-scale distributed environments It splits a computing task into two phases the map phase and the reduce phase In each phase data are only processed locally within each node so that the cost of data transmitting can be saved Dryad is similar to GFS/MapReduce e xcept that it is developed based on Microsoft Windows Web data analysis and mining tools such as Sawzall PigLatin and W eb Studio 16 are de v eloped using mapreduce or Dryad

6 Future work DisG is still in its early development stage There are several research problems remain which are discussed as follows Structure index of graphs Though current implementation supports data object lookup and subgraph reconstruction to retrieve a subgraph given a path or graph pattern is still inef\002cient The problem become even more severe while the patterns are regular patterns in which wild-cards on content tag or even paths structures are allowed We are working on more sophisticated structure index for support such complex queries over graphs Traverse in graphs Currently DisG is designed for subgraph reconstruction However DisG cannot support graph traverse which means walk along with some pointers to visit a series of data objects ef\002ciently Therefore DisG is only a repository other than a full functional graph database Hadoop modi\002cation for DisG Hadoop is a general platform for distributed storage and computing tasks However the storage and mapping scheme used by Hadoop is not convenient for DisG from certain perspective For example the hashing function used in Hadoop is not designed for numerical attributes or structure index Therefore we are working on modi\002cation of Hadoop to better support DisG Utilization of BigTable and Hbase for DisG Current implentation of DisG is directly upon Hadoop BigTable and its correspondance in Hadoop Hbase provides more complicated and useful functions for structured data management We are working on the problem of DisG implementation over BigTable References  G O Arocena and A O Mendelzon W eboql Restructuring documents databases and webs In ICDE  pages 2433 IEEE Computer Society 1998  G O Arocena A O Mendelzon and G A Mihaila Applications of a web query language Computer Networks  29\(8-13 1997  F  Chang J Dean S Ghema w at W  C Hsieh D A W allach M Burrows T Chandra A Fikes and R Gruber Bigtable A distributed storage system for structured data awarded best paper In OSDI  pages 205218 USENIX Association 2006  F  Dabek M F  Kaashoek D R Kar ger  R Morris and I Stoica Wide-area cooperative storage with cfs In SOSP  pages 202215 2001  J Dean and S Ghema w at Mapreduce Simpli\002ed data processing on large clusters In OSDI  pages 137150 2004  S Ghema w at H Gobiof f and S.-T  Leung The google 002le system In M L Scott and L L Peterson editors SOSP  pages 2943 ACM 2003  M Isard M Budiu Y  Y u A Birrell and D Fetterly  Dryad distributed data-parallel programs from sequential building blocks In EuroSys  pages 5972 ACM 2007  J K ubiato wicz D Bindel Y  Chen S E Czerwinski P  R Eaton D Geels R Gummadi S C Rhea H Weatherspoon W Weimer C Wells and B Y Zhao Oceanstore An architecture for global-scale persistent storage In ASPLOS  pages 190201 2000  C Olston B Reed U Sri v asta v a R K umar  and A Tomkins Pig latin a not-so-foreign language for data processing In J T.-L Wang editor SIGMOD Conference  pages 10991110 ACM 2008  R Pik e S Dorw ard R Griesemer  and S Quinlan Inter preting the data Parallel analysis with sawzall Scienti\002c Programming  13\(4 2005  W  Qian and A Zhou Chinese web infrastructure b uilding Challenges and our roadmap In INGS  2008  S Ratnasamy  P  Francis M Handle y  R M Karp and S Shenker A scalable content-addressable network In SIGCOMM  pages 161172 2001  A I T  Ro wstron and P  Druschel P astry Scalable decentralized object location and routing for large-scale peer-topeer systems In R Guerraoui editor Middleware  volume 2218 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science  pages 329350 Springer 2001  A I T  Ro wstron and P  Druschel  Storage management and caching in past a large-scale persistent peer-to-peer storage utility In SOSP  pages 188201 2001  I Stoica R Morris D R Kar ger  M F  Kaashoek and H Balakrishnan Chord A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications In SIGCOMM  pages 149 160 2001  J.-R W en and W Y  Ma W ebstudio b uilding infrastructure for web data management In C Y Chan B C Ooi and A Zhou editors SIGMOD Conference  pages 875876 ACM 2007  B Y  Zhao J K ubiato wicz and A D Joseph T apestry a fault-tolerant wide-area application infrastructure Computer Communication Review  32\(1 2002

1  Ml Vj Therefore from Lemma 3.3 we know that the previous problem is equivalent to the following minimize{f A,...,AI max min dA3 gM 30 iC{f1,...,M jef{1,...,N subject to dAi Aj _ rsep for all i,j S E 31 This problem is equivalent to the continuous p-center problem 14 but with the connectivity constraints between the centers We make following observation regarding the complexity of the problem Notice that the problem in Equation 32 is the continuous pcenter problem which is NP hard We therefore look at the following two cases separately 1 Number of airborne nodes greater than or equal to the number of ground nodes In this case the solution to the first problem is obtained trivially by assigning M airborne nodes to the M ground node locations The locations of the remaining N M airborne nodes are unconstrained Next we solve the following convex problem minimize{1,,...,iA max d4 g  35 Proposition 3.4 The optimization problem described in Equations 30 and 31 is NP hard Proof Let M  N Let AiPt be the optimal location of the center of the ith trajectory for the unconstrained problem Also let Si be the set of ground nodes that have A Pt as the nearest trajectory center where i C  1 N Then Ai\260Pt must lie at the circumcenter of the points in Si But the cicumcenter of the points in Si belongs to the convex hull of Si Also since Si C  1 gM the convex hull of Si is a subset of the convex hull of 1 GM Thus A4opt A o pt is a subset of the convex hull of Q  Q g The NP hardness of the constrained problem therefore follows from the observation that with rsep  diameter{f 1 QM  the problem reduces to the unconstrained problem which in turn is the standard continuous pcenter problem which is known to be NP hard 14 U Since the problem is NP hard we now present a heuristic to solve the above problem The heuristic consists of two stages In the first stage we solve the following unconstrained optimization problem minimize{f1,A A max min dA3 gM 32 ATiC 1,...,M jC{f1,...,N Let A  A be the optimal locations of the airborne nodes obtained after solving the above problem In the second stage we solve the following problem minimize A  max dA O Vi Ei,j kij  1 43 Equation 38 describes the constraints in Equation 36 Equation 39 specifies the distances between all pairs of ground nodes Since the ground node locations are known so are the distances Note that for i C 1  M the left hand side of Equation 40 is dA ig,i Intuitively speaking by minimizing the variable t we are minimizing the upper bound on dA g which is equal to maxiC M dA-g A rigorous of the above reformulation can be found in 11 For a discussion on the remaining solution procedure please refer to Scenario 1 earlier in the section Figure 6 shows another scenario but now with five airborne nodes In this one 7  N  M Kii  K:jj-2K:ij  t Vi E  N  A 33 subject to dAi i_  rsep for all i,j S 8 34 Lemma 3.5 Convexity of the optimization problem The constrained optimization problem described in Equations 33 and 34 is a convex optimization problem Note that the constraints dA AjK rsep for all i j describe a convex set The fact that maxiC{1,...,N dAiA is a convex function of Al AN can be easily shown using the triangle inequality for metric spaces subject to dA,-Aj K rsep for all i j C ES 36 Two example scenarios are discussed as follows In the first scenario we have four ground and four airborne nodes The locations of the ground nodes are as depicted by the asterisks in Figure 5 The airborne network topology is a ring The constant rsep is 200 nautical miles The blue solid lines in Figure 5 denote communication links between the airborne nodes The dashed lines represent the communication links between the airborne and ground nodes The numeric values represent distances for the corresponding links To obtain the optimal locations of the airborne trajectory centers we first relax the problem and pose it as a semi-definite program Notice that this problem is a convex optimization problem and can be solved even if the objective function is not differentiable using sub-gradient methods However our heuristic involving SDP has also been observed to give optimal solutions The semi-definite program is as follows First let us define the augmented vector X  Al  4ANQ1    GM and let C  XTX The optimization problem in Equations 35 and 36 can be written as min t 37 subject to K:ii  K:jj-21 ij  rp Vi j E K:ii  K:jj-2Kij  dgi gj Vi j E N  1 j IC O 38 39 40 41 42 E N  MI   


of the nodes is not assigned to any ground node as described earlier The topology for airborne network is again a ring Notice that the communication links between airborne and ground nodes are shorter now signifying greater upload capacity This is due to the fact that the extra airborne node allows for the network to spread out more and hence get closer to the ground nodes 4 Ground nodes 4 Airborne nodes Ix 32 3464 250 P 200 f68 3215 150 49~2218 100 501541 98 99 74 52 0632 1 Choose uniformly and randomly N cluster centers 2 Assign each ground node to the cluster center that is nearest to it Let Qcl  c be the ground nodes assigned to the cth cluster 3 For each cluster say c compute the new cluster center as k  Argmin max dA-gm i A i{fci  I 44 4 Repeat the above steps till the locations of the cluster centers do not change beyond a certain threshold Let A AN be the cluster centers kl  kN obtained as the output of the algorithm Next the convex optimization problem in Equations 33 and 34 is solved to obtain the desired airborne trajectory centers   760~53 52 0632 200 150 100 50 0 50 100 150 x Figure 5 Coverage using multiple airborne nodes when locations of ground nodes are known Here we have 4 ground nodes denoted by s and 4 airborne nodes denoted by circles The axes represent x,y lLocations on a 2 D plane The optimal placement results in each airborne node providing coverage to a unique ground node while maintaining a connected topology between themselves 1-76-77-72142265 150 100 50 0 x 39 5904 50 100 Figure 6 In thLs case there is an extra airborne node The op timal placement in this case results in higher maximum data upload capacity to each ground node Note that one airborne node approximately at 60,130 acts purely as a relay 2 Number of ground nodes greater than the number of airborne nodes In this case the problem in general is NP hard An efficient and popular method of solving this problem is a heuristic similar to the k-means clustering algorithm described as follows 4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Conclusions In this paper we have studied the placement planning problem of the airborne network We first define two metrics maximum data upload capacity for air-ground links and worst case link activity percentage for air-air links We have shown that the maximum data upload capacity is a measure of the coverage provided to a single ground node and the worst case link activity percentage for a single air-air link is a decreasing function of the distance between the centers of the loiter orbits of the airborne nodes We have also discussed how this measure is useful in the design of networks for delay-tolerant applications This paper considers three practically interesting scenarios for the deployment of the airborne network backbone where the purpose of the airborne network is to provide coverage to the ground nodes while maintaining a certain degree of reliability and connectivity in the inter-airborne node topol8 250 200 7.3458 46.9364 Figure 7 A snapshot of the optimal coverage of 4 ground nodes using 5 airborne nodes The rings at the top indicate the loiter orbits of the airborne nodes the shaded circles on the ground indicate their respective instantaneous coverage disk and the fixed ground node positions are indicated by s 150  100 _ 50 24.9954 200 4 Ground nodes 5 Airborne nodes 15.8688

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process.
