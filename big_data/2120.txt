As more and more organizations and institutions are moving towards the e-learning strategy personality-learning model becomes a big challenge Learning styles, academic achievements and learning objectives of various groups of students on the network are very different. Personality learning system, which uses different learning programs for different students, can enhance the efficiency of learning process. Focusing on the personality learning, the article explores a new method that the net learning system exploits intelligent reasoning service to provide the learners with personalized teaching resources and teaching styles Keywords- E-learning; personality-learning; intelligent reasoning I   I NTRODUCTION  With the flourishing development of contemporary information technology and network learning, E-learning play a vital role in people’s learning life. E-learning is aimed at maximizing the efficiency of teaching and learning by means of a self-learning method which enables individual learners to choose the exact learning resources befitting their level and ability[1  2   3   In this paper, the representations and the factors that influence personality learning are analyzed. Based on which a framework of intelligence e-learning platform is designed. And how the learning resources and learning styles will acclimatize themselves to the learner’s personality to improve the learning efficiency is presented II  THE  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  THE  FACTORS  THAT  INFLUENCE  PERSONALITY  LEARNING   The learning style is developed from the individual’s physiological characteristic, and will be influenced by psychology development, social environment and education experience. The prefer learning time, study habits \( alone, pair or in groups\earning approach gender, ethnicity are have great deal with the selection of the network learning time, the presentation of the learning resource and the process of learn. eg student who belongs to audile will prefer learn knowledge by hearing to learn knowledge by reading. A practical student’s learning material should have more practice case than theoretics Vigor dominated learner usually has irregular learning time and learning motivation governed by interest Academic achievement and perceive level which are the knowledge and the framework builded from knowledge will finally decide the learning material and the depth of knowledge. So self-learning system must acquire and continually updated the recognition of students’ mastery of knowledge and learning ability. The system has to record the learning information for each student: the individual learning style, preferred study habits, learning approach his dynamic learning situation and even detail information such as if the student respond to the teacher in time. The system quantizes this information and provides appropriate teaching content based on each self-learning character 4  This approach is implemented through intelligent elearning system III  CONSTRUCTION  PERSONALITY  ELEARNING  SYSTEM   Intelligent personality E-learning system must acquire and continually updated the recognition of students mastery of knowledge, learning ability and learning style To identify and update the learning personality, expert knowledge base and self-learning system is introduce in the system System consists of man-machine interface, database self-learning system and expert knowledge base of several parts. Its overall module is shown in Figure 1  Figure 1  The framework of e-learning system Database includes the student information database and learning content database, through its management system to accept, store, provide, modify data on students and learning resources; knowledge base through its management system to store, extract, modify reasoning model. self-learning module , a key executive of the system, it is a procedure that explained to knowledge in

fact, according to the semanteme of knowledge, explain to and carry out the knowledge found according to certain tactics, and record the result in the appropriate space of database. Man-machine interface is the interaction between the user and the system. The user issued an instruction through the man-machine interface, the data base management system will follow the order and store the data in the database or revise the data in the database knowledge base management system based on the user's instructions to extract from the knowledge base model, and drew relevant data to make operation and deduce from database The system’s core module functions as follows: 1\ the learner information collection module, which includes the basic personal data acquisition, learning style and academic achievement collection. Basic personal information must collect the  basic personal information and learning habits; learning style acquisition modules need to capture the students learning time, cognitive styles and other information; academic achievement acquisition module obtain the immediate knowledge and collateral knowledge of the specific course which learner had mastered. 2\ Self-learning system is the core of the personality system and also the most difficulty part to implement. Not only does it need to acquire the learning condition of the student but also it needs to have certain reasoning ability. Bayesian network has a powerful ability for reasoning and semantic representation. Which combine with qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis, with prior knowledge and observed data, and provides an effective way to deal with prediction, classification and clusteri 6  S o  B a y e si a n ne t w o r k l e a r ni ng m e t h o d s  can be used to self-learning system 3\ Personalized learn content generation module. For the learners learning style learning strategies through the knowledge base to retrieve the relevant learning strategies, combined with specific learning content resources for the establishment of personalized services of individual learner curriculum system. \(including the course material, course material presentation, self-test item bank IV  LEARNING  RESOURCES  INTERFACE  DESIGN HID interface known as the user interface is the communication and computer access. Learning resources content design and interaction design must also meet the learners to study personality, through multiple channels to interact with different learner activities, learning Mental and emotional positive impact. interface design, including creativity and production of two processes, and in the layout of content, including interface design and media design A  Creativity of Interface Design The intention that the interface is designed should be confirmed on the basis of different learners and study content. Metaphor, definitude, consistency, direction navigation in essential feature, is exactly that they offer the entry. Metaphor symbolic representative of the structure indicate designers based on its design of the various entry and link. A clear metaphor, abstraction and conceptual metaphor should be used together. Definitude refers to each element in the page has its reason to exist Consistency includes consistency of the tone, consistency of the navigation style, consistency of the script and figure element style, etc. Direction refers to the learners in the learning process can be easily understand their exact location, and will not get lost, as each page has a title displayed in the browser's title bar, or to provide the page logo header, footer, etc N a vi ga t i o n  T h e m a i n p u rpo s e  i s  to provide learners with a variety of options and to point to other regions of the link navigation should be considered in the design of the structure, location, selection of media as well as the ever-increasing data management and other factors B  Design of Media elements Each of the media element has its own unique features different characteristics of learners will choose a different media, or choose a combination of certain types of media to perform learning content. Text design is an important part of interface design and the most important manifestations of interfaces, often symmetrical arrangement, non-symmetrical layout, scheduling stress irregular scheduling, scheduling techniques to contrast combinations of text layout, fonts, font size, color choice and size of the comparison, thickness contrast, brightness contrast, texture contrast, and background and other elements to be coordinated r ap hi c i m a g e s used  properly can be more directly and vividly describe some of the problems. Graphic image can be used to study the performance of the content can also be used as buttons or other symbols. Audio, including commentary, music and sound effects. Can be used to transfer knowledge and information, enhance effectiveness, but also for interactive Animation can be well simulated for students to see the phenomenon difficult to understand, but also increase their interest in learning. At present, in the E-Learning Resources in heavy use of FLASH vector animation because the files are small, transfer facilitate and production fast and flexible. Video elements and images animation, audio, relations are very close .integration of these elements can be characterized V  CONCLSION   In a traditional e-Learning platform to introduce personalized service is necessary and efficient personalized service can provide a means of personal interest to the learner characteristics in line with the teaching resources to achieve the needs of the theory of knowledge structure. Through the above description of the rules, We can learn from the students based on behavior analysis of the learners to infer personality, and then learning objectives to, provide learning resources and content using Bayesian network algorithm, then the systematic planning of students need to learn what it is and the next most need to learn is presented R EFERENCES   1  S.

The left and right panel correspond to images for the ? = 0 and ? = 3 breathing phases respectively as f?0 . Therefore, it is reasonable to only pose a constraint such as \(4 images at the corresponding phase without artificially induce too much prior knowledge. Second, though E3[f ] provides a reasonably strong constraint on the image, TV norm is indeed still necessary in this reconstruction. As will be seen in our experiments, since partial information has been lost after the PCA training and dimension reduction, the image reconstructed without TV regularization will be wavy, noizy and with some ghost feature. The TV norm is essential here to remove those artifacts Once the energy is defined, we perform the minimization procedure via a simple gradient descent method. In each iteration step, we computed the gradient of the energy functional and use the negative gradient as a searching direction for a better solution. An inexact line search is performed in order to find the location for an update. The iteration terminates when the energy decrease between successive iteration steps is smaller than a predetermined small threshold III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The experiment is based on a synthetic data set, which demonstrates the validity of our TV+PCA regularization algorithm. It also shows that our method outperforms if only TV or PCA is used We first synthesize a phantom of physical dimension 20  20cm2 with N = 256 pixels on each dimension. The phantom contains a set of elements of circular and elliptical shapes with different intensity scales as shown in Fig. 1 A respiratory cycle is divided into T = 10 phases. The elements in the phantom change shapes and/or locations in different phases in a periodic way. As an example, the images at ? = 0 and ? = 3 phases are illustrated in Fig. 1 The image at each phase is projected along Np = 10 directions equally spaced by an angle of 36?. Note that in a previous study, 20 projections are required in order to achieve the reconstruction purpose with only TV regularization term[4]. At each projection angle, the detector is modeled as an array of Nb = 512 bins with a total length of 41.3cm. The center of rotation for the source-detector gantry locates coincides with the center of the image. The distance 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 Figure 2. Reconstruction of the phantom using TV+PCA at breathing phase ? = 0 \(left right with a low image contrast from the source to rotational center is 40cm, so is the distance from the rotational center to detector. The system matrix P k for a particular projection view is computed via 


matrix P k for a particular projection view is computed via the Siddon  s ray tracing algorithm[8 In the PCA training stage, a full respiratory cycle of T = 10 images are examined and the first NPCA = 3 principle components are computed and to be used as the prior information in the image reconstruction stage. Based on the eigenvalues ?i of the covariance matrix, it is estimated that the first NPCA = 3 principle components accounts for about 90% information of the training image series In the reconstruction stage, we take an initial guess with all zero pixel values. The optimization converges after 1020 gradient descent iterations. Other initial guesses such as back projection data are also tested. However, no significant difference is seen in the final results Fig. 2 demonstrates the reconstruction of TV+PCA algorithm for two breathing phases ? = 0 and ? = 3. The Lagrangian multiplier for TV regularization term is chosen to be ? = 20.0, which weights the TV norm significantly to produce a piecewise homogeneous pattern in each elements within the phantom. The choice of ? = 0.6 included a proper level of prior information regarding the image at a corresponding phase. These two parameters are tuned carefully so that visually the best reconstruction results are produced We compare our results with those produced by only TV and only PCA method. As shown in Fig. 3, the left 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 50 100 150 200 250 Figure 3. Reconstruction of the phantom at phase ? = 0 with only TV regularization \(left right 475 Figure 4. The comparison of the reconstructed image profiles along a horizontal slice cut at y = 128 pixel line in ? = 0 image panel demonstrates the reconstruction results at ? = 0 with only TV regularization with ? = 20.0. The results is smeared out and inaccurate due to the extremely few projection directions. In particular, white spots in the black background outside the phantom is seen, as those regions are not covered by any x-ray projections, and hardly be reconstructed. On the other hand, the right panel in Fig. 3 shows the results with only PCA regularization with ? = 0.6 Though all main features of the phantom are captured in this figure, ringing effects along the boundary and ghost artifacts around the largest circle are clearly seen. This is due to the incomplete knowledge of the prior information after the dimension reduction in PCA training stage. In comparison to Fig. 2 our method, which is the combination of the above two regularization terms, outperforms both of them It is more desirable to compare TV, PCA and TV+PCA method by visualizing the results along one horizontal slice cut at the y = 128 pixel line in ? = 0. The results are depicted in Fig.4. Even TV regularization algorithm has the virtue of restoring piece-wise constant function, which is the ground-truth in this example, it loses its ability in dealing with this situation of extremely few projections This suggests us using as much prior knowledge as possible However, if only PCA is used as the regularization, it leads to a certain level of noise due to the loss of information at the PCA training stage The quantitative measurement of all the methods is given in Table.I, where root-mean-square \(RMS 


the reconstructed and the ground true images are computed It is obvious that among the three method we discussed TV reconstruction produces the largest RMS error. Though the PCA method and the PCA+TV method give about the same level of RMS error, visually PCA+TV method beats the pure PCA method as the former is able to remove noise and ghost effect coming from the PCA training stage Table I ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERROR OF THE RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES AT 0 AND ? = 3 PHASES BY THREE DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS TV+PCA TV PCA 0 16.24 24.15 15.59 3 15.67 25.47 16.33 IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION In summary, we propose in this paper a method combing the TV regularization and PCA regularization in order to dynamically perform the CT image reconstruction from few 10 method is able to reproduce the phantom with great details and therefore demonstrates its power in reconstructing images at all respiratory phases. We have also compared with the reconstruction based on only TV regularization and only PCA regularization. Though both of these methods have drawbacks to some extent, by combining those two, our method outperforms both of them In observing Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, one defect in our method is the lose of image contrast caused by the gradient descent algorithm while minimizing the energy functional It has been proven that an efficient way of overcoming this drawback is to apply Bregman iterations[9] instead of gradient descent iterations during the minimization process It certainly requires further work along this approach REFERENCES 1] L.

 The three subtopics were then discussed and analyzed at each table and a summary analysis was then shared with all participants. A very long list of individual issues for further research emerged for each of the themes. These issues were then re-categorized into three overarching research themes, aimed at learning 1\e best processes and practices leading to an effective EA; \(2\e organizational outcomes of using EA; and \(3\ow to measure EA outcomes In our preliminary analysis, we focused on the notes generated on the first topic of discussion. Based on the notes, we identified three key problems that organizations faced related to the EA development and implementation process. For each problem, we analyzed the solutions proposed, and classified them into either governance or coordination oriented. This analysis shows us how examining solutions to EA problems from both perspectives provides a more comprehensive view of managing EA. We next present the problems and the proposed solutions, based on both the governance and coordination perspectives Problem 1: How to bridge the gap between IT and business personnel Participants highlighted that IT personnel in EA teams were often too technical in their focus and they lacked the ability to speak the business language, thus influencing their communication with Business personnel. This affects their ability to make a cogent business case for EA and for IT investments Conversely, Business personnel were not sufficiently leveraging on IT personnel for their expertise From the governance perspective, workshop participants suggested providing incentives, and redefining the goals of the EA teams to focus on business development. On the business side, the use of incentives may be more challenging. Another possible solution was the assignment of EA liaison roles, who would be responsible for following up with the requests of specific business units. Other participants also noted that it may be a good idea to require the EA team to partner with business units to make any business case. Hence, making a proposal for a solution requires inputs from both business unit and IT From the coordination perspective, workshop participants provided suggestions that clearly illustrated the importance of developing shared knowledge between IT and Business Personnel i.e cognitive coordination.  Frequent interaction over time i.e., organic coordination was a key solution. The education of one another was also a key way to build shared cognition. Finally, workshop participants also noted the need to develop both the breadth and the depth of the expertise of the EA team, in order for them to be able to communicate effectively with both IT and business personnel Problem 2. How to involve the necessary stakeholders from many different business units Participants highlighted that a key challenge was in getting everyone to the table Given that each business unit had its own budget and was more interested in issues that concerned their own business unit than others, it was a challenge to involve all the necessary stakeholders, and to get cooperation across the entire spectrum of stakeholders From the governance perspective, workshop participants suggested that it was important to structure the budget such that the initial stages of EA introduction had its own budget, and did not have to depend on that of business unit. It should also be made clear who makes the final decision. Workshop participants suggested that IT should play the role of the partner, guiding business units to make the appropriate choice. Participants also noted the need to provide incentives for people from different units to work together. It may not always be through the provision of money, but the provision of recognition From the coordination perspective, cross-functional work groups were suggested as an effective way for individuals to understand how individual actions in one business unit affect people in another business unit  i.e., understanding task dependencies.  This also was a good way to help build shared knowledge between key individuals in different business units i.e., cognitive coordination. Communication about the budget is also a helpful way to ensure a shared perspective across different units. As highlighted by a participant, it was important to get people together through discussions discussions, discussions Patience and time was also pointed out to be key. While people from different business units may not see eye to eye during the first meeting, they will learn about each others perspectives through frequent interactions Problem 3. How to focus people on the right objectives  For example, one participant noted was that there was increasing focus on cost-cutting in IT, and this may be at the risk of innovation. From the governance perspective, participants noted that it was important to make use of various decision-making frameworks that clarify the key objectives. The use of the right measurements and metrics to show what the organization values is also one way to focus on the appropriate objectives. However,  one has to first define the key objectives and this would require the inputs of the top management for both, IT and business From the coordination perspective, the CIO and chief architect play a key role in helping to inculcate the right values in their team, to ensure that they focus on the right objectives. This helps develop a shared vision Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 to which the entire EA effort can aim to reach i.e cognitive coordination In summary, the preliminary analysis shows that the governance perspective usually identifies structural solutions to various problems and challenges encountered during the EA development and implementation process. The coordination perspective provides complementary insights by identifying additional solutions such as ways to develop shared knowledge amongst EA stakeholders. Hence we believe that integrating these two perspectives in a more comprehensive study would provide us with significant insights into effective EA management.  We now describe the research design we plan to use in the next few months to explore our research questions empirically 4. Further Study Given that the preliminary study has provided some face validity to our proposed idea of integrating the governance and coordination perspectives, we plan to conduct an in-depth study of our proposed framework using semi-structured interviews and grounded theory methods. Because different organizations may be at different stages of EA maturity d EA  implementation, and may employ very different approaches to EA, we plan to interview a large number of enterprise architects and senior IT managers from various organizations in the public, private government and educational sectors. Several of the participants of the workshops discussed in the Study Background section above have expressed an interest in participating Interviews are a widely used method in information systems research for exploratory studies \(Orlikowski 1993; Majchrzak, Rice et al. 2000; Malhotra Majchrzak et al. 2001; Orlikowski 2002\terview questions will ask multiple participants from various organizations about the governance mechanisms and structures implemented under their governance framework. To inquire about coordination processes interview questions will be focused on identifying the EA layers, architecture segments and the EA maturity and approach for each company in the sample. The questions will then shift in focus to the discovery of key dependencies between EA layers in the same segment, between segments in the same EA layer, and between any two cells from different layers and segments \(see Figure 1\ dependency identified the follow up questions will be aimed at: \(1 classifying the type of dependency as related to technical, temporal or process coordination; \(2 identifying particular EA activities involved; \(3 documenting the particular coordination process used to manage the dependency; \(2\tifying the geographical boundaries separating those involved and determining whether how these boundaries affect coordination; \(5\ermining how coordination is enhanced or constrained by various governance structure and processes; and \(6\aluating the coordination outcomes of individual systems affected Interview The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim and then analyzed using Grounded Theory 33 Grou n d ed T h eory i s a w i del y  us ed qu alitati v e  method in information systems research [10, 22, 61  and global collaboration l arl y  w h e n t h e  study is exploratory, and the theoretical development of the topic is in its early stages A s pres c ribed by  Grounded Theory the sample size of participant organizations will be determined by theoretical saturation \(i.e., interviews will stop when no new insights are gained from additional interviews\Also as prescribed by Grounded Theory, the data will be analyzed as is being collected to help re-direct the inquiry based on what the emerging data suggests Also, consistent with Grounded Theory, we will develop an initial coding scheme do open coding of the verbatim text data. Open coding focuses on uncovering general recurrent themes. Once the recurring themes are identified and we have refined our coding scheme we will do axial coding of the text data to find relationships among these themes. The interview cases will then be analyzed by sorting text segments by their respective codes to uncover patterns of responses for each code in the coding scheme. Per Grounded Theory the main goal will be to evaluate similarities and differences among the cases with respect to coordination processes, geographic boundaries, EA activities and coordination outcomes 5. Concluding Remarks  We have proposed a research model and research design for an empirical study to investigate how EA activities are most effectively coordinated, within the constraints or with the help of a governance framework. Our study method will focus on the generation of rich accounts from interviews with experienced system architects and IT managers that will provide insights into the type of dependencies involved with EA activities in large organizational contexts in which the EA itself and the individuals responsible for it are geographically dispersed  6.

                                Box 3.1. Basics of Survival Analysis  A comprehensive discussion of this topic in the context of PHM can be found in Ma and Krings \(2008a Survival analysis, also known as failure time analysis, has become a de facto standard for analyzing time-to-event data in biomedical research in the last two decades Survival analysis studies positive random variables for describing times to events in concern, also known as survival time, failure time, or simply time-to-event  Survivor Function and Hazard Function  Survivor function and hazard function are two of the most fundamental definitions in survival analysis. The survivor function S\(t time \(T is lt;&lt;?= ttTPtS 0   Note that S\(t function R\(t instantaneous rate of failure at T=t, conditional upon survival to time t.  It is defined as      lim  0 tS tf t tTttTtPt t  lt The above definitions are for univariate survival analysis; survival analysis has been extended to multivariate systems, or the multivariate survival analysis Hougaard 2000, Ma and Krings 2008c 3.7 and 3.8 for Multivariate Survival Analysis  Fundamental Model of Survival Analysis

It is a semi-parametric model that correlates conditional survivor \(hazard vector \(z  Hazard Function ?\(t, z covariate vector z zetzt  0 where ?0 \(t function for continuous failure time T  Conditional Survival Functions \(on z   0   ztSztS where  t duutS 0 00 exp is the baseline survivor function  There are numerous extensions to Cox's model \(e.g Therneau and Grambsch 2000, Martinussen &amp; Scheike 2006 8                             UUUR, survival analysis, competing risks analysis, and multivariate survival analysis can be utilized to assess the effects of UUUR events. This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis                                                      Cont' Box 3.1  Another model that is of nearly comparable status with Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
