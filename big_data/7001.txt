Mining Association Rules with Composite Items   Xiiifeng Ye Department of Computer Science University of Auckland New Zealand Abstract Association rules can be used to express relation ships between items of data Mining associations rules is to analysis the data in a database to discover 223interesting\224 rules Existing algorithms for mining association rules require that a record in the database contain all the data items in a rule This requirement makes it dificult to discover certain useful rules an some applications To solve the 
problem this paper describes an algorithm for mining association rules with composite items The algorithm has the poten tial to discover rules which cannot be discovered by existing algorithms 1 Introduction Data mining has attracted much research in re cent years The problem of mining association rules was introduced in l Association rules can be used to express relationships between items of data An association rule is an expression A\222  Y where X and Yare sets of items X and Yare termed as item sets For a set of transactions where each transac tion is a set of 
items the meaning of an association rule is that the transactions which contain the items in X tend to also contain the items in Y For an itemset say X the support of X denoted as s\(X is the number of transactions that contain all items in X Given a minimum support 6 an itemset X is large or is referred to as a large itemset if s\(X 2 6 The confidence of an association rule X  Y is w 
i.e the percentage of the transactions which contain X that also contain Y Rules are useful if their confidence is above a minimum confidence value specified by the users An example of such a rule might be that 90 of patients who cough and have chest pain are suffering from pneumonia Here the two symptoms coughing and chest pain are the items in X and pneumonia is the item in Y 90 is the confidence of the rule 221This work is supported by Auckland University un der grant A18/XXXXX/SZ09O/F3414040 
and by ESPRIT HPCN Project No 22693 0-7803-4053-1/97/$10.00  1997 JEEE John A Keane Department of Computation UMIST Manchester UK The problem of mining association rules is to find all rules X  Y such that X U I\222 is a large itemset and the confidence of X 3 Y is above the minimum confidence Many algorithms have been developed for mining association rules l 2,3,4 5 61 In these algorithms if a transaction supports an itemset the transaction must contain all the items in the itemset This 
re quirement makes it difficult to discover certain useful rules in some applications For example assume that a patients database contains the symptoms of the patients and the di agnosis The symptoms and the diagnosis are the items A transaction in the database consists of a patient\222s symptoms and the corresponding diagno sis The database is mined to discover the symptoms of diseases Assume that a disease, say A makes the patients either show symptom B or C the number of patients who show B or C and are diagnosed as having A 
is smaller than the minimum support, and the number of patients who either show B or C and are diagnosed as having A exceeds the minimum support From assumption b itemsets A B and A C are not large As a result rules B  A and C 3 A will not be generated This is unsatis factory Ideally the mining should be able to find a rule which indicates that if a patient shows symp tom B or C then the patient is suffering from disease A 
Combining B and C to form a new item B v C A record in the database contains B V C if the record contains either B or C From assumption c it can be seen that itemset A B V C is large As a result rule B V C  A will be generated The algorithm in this paper allows itemsets to include composite items like B V C in the above ex ample A composite item consists of several items 1367 


A transaction contains a composite item if the trans action contains at least one of the items in the com posite item As a result, not only the rules involving simple items e.g B C  A can be discovered it is also possible to discover the rules involving com posite it,ems e.g BVC  A BVC D  A etc Thus the algorithm in this paper has the po tential to discover rules which cannot be discovered by existing algorithms Mining association rules can be decomposed into two steps 1 the database is scanned to find all large item sets 2 association rules are generated from these large itemsets The first step is expensive as the database needs to be scanned The second step is relatively easier 5 This paper concentrates on the first step finding large itemsets The organisation of the paper is as follows in 2 the definition of composite items are given the al gorithms for finding large composite items and large itemsets are discussed in 3 conclusions are given in 2474 2 Association Rules with Composite Let I  al  am be the set of literals called atomic items A composite item is formed by com bining several atomic items The general form of a composite item is a1 V  V a where aj E I for 1 5 j 5 n and ai  aj for z  j A database consists of transactions where each transaction is a set of atomic items A transaction contains a com posite item if the transaction contains at least one of the atomic items which form the composite item Atomic items and composite items will be referred to as items in general An item is large if the num ber of transactions containing the item exceeds the minimum support For a composite item consisting of i atomic items e.g alVa2V  Vu the i-1 of alVa2V  Vai is a composite item formed by selecting i-1 atomic items from aI,a2  ai For example A V B V C has three distinct 2-subitems They are AV B AV C and B V C An itemset is a set of items such that none of the items in the set have common items For example A BVC is a valid itemset However, {A AVB CV D C V D V E is not a valid itemset as a A and A V B have common item A and It ems b CVDandCVDVE 1iavecommonitemCVD An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y where X Y and X U Y are itemsets X  O,Y  0 and XnY  0 An itemset consisting of i items is called an i itemset The i-I of an i-itemset is an i I which is formed by selecting i-1 items from the z-itemset An 2-itemset has i distinct i 1 For example a 3-itemset A B C has three 2-subsets i.e A B A,C and B,C 3 Algorithm for Finding Large Item sets Finding large itemsets can be carried out in two steps Step 1 Find all the large items and the large composite items1 Step 2 Find all the large itemsets i.e the itemsets whose supports are greater than the minimum support At this step each large composite item is treated as an independent item like the atomic items It is assumed that the users are only interested with the composite items generated from a set of atomic items This set of atomic items will be pro vided by the users For example, assume that a there are five atomic items A B C D and E and b\the users are only interested in the composite items generated from items A B and C From A Band C four composite items AVB AV C BVC and AVBVC can be formed At step 1 the database is scanned to find the large items Assume that a the large composite items are A V B A V C and AV B V C and b the large atomic items are A D and E At step 2 itemsets are formed using the large items i.e A,D,E,AvB,AVC and AVBVC and the database is scanned to find out which of An item or a composite item is large if the number of transactions containing the item or composite item exceeds minimum support 1368 


these itemsets are large The reason that only the large atomic items and the large composite items are used in constructing itemsets is because all the items in a large itemset must be large 3 3.1 Patient Database Example A patient database is shown in Figure l\(a The symptoms and diseases are the items It is assumed that AvBvC a the minimum support is 3 and 1 the users are interested in the composite items generated from set A B C From A B C four composite items i.e A V B V C AV B AV C and B v C are formed The database is mined to find out the symptoms of the disease First the large composite items and the large atomic items are found The large items found are shown in Figure l\(b and c Then the large atomic items in Figure l\(c and the large com posite items in Figure l\(b are used to construct itemsets According to the definition in 2 X  0 and Y  0 in rule X 3 Y holds Thus only the large itemsets which contain more than one item can be used to generate rules Figure l\(d shows the large itemsets which will be used to generate rules From Figure l\(a it can be seen that symptom A or B or C indicates that a patient suffers from dis ease S However without using the composite items i.e A V B V C etc S will not appear in any large itemsets As a result the symptoms of S cannot be discovered 3 a Database AVB BVC A C D S T 1 A  D  SST 1 3 3 e Large Atomic Items d Large 2 and 3-itemsets 3.2 Finding Large Items Finding large atomic items is easy First a counter is set up for each atomic item Then the database is scanned to check whether the atomic items are con tained in the transactions and the counters of the atomic items will be increased accordingly When scanning is completed the atomic items whose coun ters are greater than the minimum support are recorded as large items Finding large composite items is more compli cated This is because the number of composite items generated from a set of atomic items might be very large Therefore it is not practical to gen erate all composite items and find the large compos ite items in a single database scan Instead large composite items are found in several database scans During each scan only a small set of composite items are checked The large composite items are found in several steps At each step first a candidate set is formed The set contains the composite items which might be large Then the database is scanned to find out which items in the candidate set are large Assume the large items found at the current step all consist of i atomic items The 2-I of the large items are used to form the candidate set of the next step When generating the candidate set the following principle is used If a transaction say t does not contain a composite item say a1 v a2 v  V a then according to the definition in 52 t does not contain any of a1,a2  a As a result t does not contain any composite items which are generated from the items in al,a2  a This means that if a1 V a2 V  V a is not a large item then none of the composite items generated from all a2  a are large Thus the composite items generated from al a2  a will not be included in the candidate set Initially the candidate set contains a single com posite item which includes all the atomic items used to construct the composite items For example as sume a1,u2,a3,a4 is the set of atomic items used to generate composite items The item in the can didate set of the first step is al V a2 V a3 V a4 As 


discussed earlier if a1 v a2 v a3 v 04 is not large then none of the composite items generated from aI,a2,a3,a4 are large Thus we can stop look ing for large composite items after the first step If al v a2 v a3 v a4 is large it is used to gen erate the items in step 2\222s candidate set Each item in step 2\222s candidate set is a 3-subitem of a1 V a2 V a3 v a4 Thus step 2\222s candidate set is a1 v a2 v u3 a1 v a2 v a4 a1 v a3 v a4 a2 v a3 v a4 The database is scanned to find the large items from the set Assume that the large items are a1 v a2 v a3 and a1 V a2 V a4 The 2-subitems of these two items form the candidate set of step 3 Thus step 3\222s can didate set is al v a2 al v a3 al v a4 a2 v a3 a v a4 AS a1 V a3 V a4 and a2 v a3 v a4 are not large from the earlier discussion a1 v a3 al v a4 a2 V a3 and a2 v a4 are not large Hence step 3\222s candidate set is reduced to al V a2 It can be seen that by ob serving the large items obtained at a step e.g step 2 it is possible to reduce the number of items in the candidate set of the next step e.g step 3 The algorithm below is used to find all large com posite items Assume that A  al a2  ak is the set of atomic items used to generate the composite items CC represents the candidate set of a step LC denotes the set of large composite items found at a step 1 CCk  a1 v a v  V I 2 for i  k;CC  0  i  l;i   do 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1\2217 for each transaction t in the database do for each candidate c E CC do end fbr each if contaan\(t c then c.count fi end-for-each LC  c E CC I c.count 2 mznzmum support if z  2 then cc,-1  0 for each ca E LC do CC,-1  CCz-l U sa I sa zs an a-1 of cz end for each for each c E CC,-I do if complete\(c LC then fi CC,-I  CC,-I  c end-for-each fi 18 end-for 19 LCI  U1 LCi complete\(a1 V  V a LC let S  a1 v  V a V a I a E A  al  a if S C LC then return 1 else return 0 fi The candidate set of the first step is given at line 1 The database is scanned in lines 3-7 contazn\(t c is a predicate which determines whether transaction t contains the composite item c LC contains all the large items found at the current step A composite item is included in LC if the support of the item is greater than the minimum support line 8 The candidate set of the next step CC,-l in cludes all the z-1 of the large items in LC lines 11-13 The items in candidate set CC will be checked against the items in LC to eliminate the items which are not large lines 14-16 The elinii nation is carried out according to complete line 15 The composite items in LC have one more atomic item than the composite items in CC,-l In com plete a composite item say c in CC,-1 is extended to include one atomic item which is not in c The ex tended items have the same number of atomic items as the items in LC If all extended items are large i.e they are in Le2 then c remains in CC,-1 Otherwise c is not large As a result c is removed from line 15\This is because as described earlier if the extended item say c V a is not large then none of c v a\222s z-1 are large That is c is not large When the candidate set becomes empty or all the composite items have been checked i.e all the items containing more than one atomic item have been checked line a all the large composite items have been found The result is stored in set LCI which is the union of all the set of the large items found at each step line 19 For example in the patient database shown in Figure l\(a assume that a the minimum support is 4 and b\the set used to generate the composite items is A B c Dl The candidate set of step 1 is CC4  A v B V C v D line 1 It can be seen that the support of AVBVCVDis4 Thus LC4={AVBVCVD The 3-subitems of A V B v C v D are used to form CC3 line 12 Hence CC3  AV BVC AV B V D AVCV D BVCV D In complete AV B V C is extended with D to form a new item A v B V C V D As AV B V C V D is in LC4 A V B V C remains in CC3 For the same reason, all the other items in CC3 also remain in CC3 At step 2 LC3 is AVBvD,BVCVD CC2 is 1370 


formed by the 2-subitems of AvBvD and BVCVD line 12 Thus CC2  AV B,A V D B V C,B V D In complete A v B is extended with C and D respectively Thus for A V B in complete S  AV B v C,A V B V D As A V B V C is not in LC3 A v B v C is not large As a result A V B cannot be large Thus A V B is removed from CC2 Similarly A v D and B v C are also removed from CC2 Hence after checking against the items in LC3 CC2 is B V D At step 3 LC2 is B V D As all the composite items have been checked the algorithm terminates Thus LCI  LCq U LC3 U LC2  AvBvCvD AVBv D BVCv D BVD 3.3 Finding Large Itemsets Once all the large items are found a procedure based on the algorithm in 3 is used to find large itemsets Modifications to 3 have been made to ac commodate composite items In the algorithm here each large composite item is treated as an indepen dent item like the large atomic items The algorithm finds the large itemsets in several steps At each step a candidate set is formed first The set contains the itemsets which might be large The candidate set is generated according to the large itemsets found at the pervious step After the can didate set is formed the database is scanned to find the large itemsets Modifications to the procedure in 3 have been made to reduce the amount of com putation required In the following A is the set of all the atomic items Lk is the set of large itemsets obtained at step k of the algorithm Ck is the set of candidate large itemsets and Ck is generated in procedure can dzdate-gen 20 L1  a I a E A and a is a large atomic item U ca I ca E LCI 21 for I  2 Lk-1  0 I   do 22 Ck candidate-gen\(Lk-l 23 24 CCt  0 25 26 27 28 fi 29 endfor-each 30 for each transaction t in database do for each itemset c E Ck do if t contains all the items in c then cct  cct U c for each itemset c E CCt do c.count end-for-each 31 endfor-each 32 33 endfor 34 answer Uk Lk Lk  c E Ck I c.count 2 minimum support Initially the large itemsets are formed using the large items line 20 The database is scanned in lines 23-31 Each transaction in the database is checked to see whether it supports the candidates in Ck Set CCt contains all the itemsets being sup ported by transaction t lines 25-29 When scan ning is completed the itemsets whose support ex ceed the minimum support become the large,item sets line 33 These large itemsets are used to gen erate the candidate large itemset for the next step line 22 At the end the large itemsets found at different stages are joined together line 34 Procedure candidategen\(lk-1 35 S  SI  si I sj E Lk-1 where 1 5 j 5 i and Vsm,sn  1 5 m  n 5 i.s and s are different in two items and the two different items do not have common atomic items and  3e E S.{SI  si c e such that I B I k where B  SI U s2 U  U sk where B  SI U s2 U  U Sk 36 5\222\222  SI  sg I SI  sk E S 37 Ck  u~,...,Q I VU  15 i 5 k.a E B such that sl  sk E SI Procedure candidate-gen calculates the large itemset candidates according to the large itemsets obtained at the previous step Each candidate in set Ck is a k-itemset If a k-itemset say S is large then each of the k-1 of S should also be large 3 If one of the k-1 of an k-itemset is not large than the k-itemset is not large 3 In candidate-gen the large k-1 obtained at the previous step are checked to see whether they are the k-1 of some k-itemsets A k-itemset becomes a candidate if all its k-1 are large In candidate-gen firstly several sets of itemsets are formed line 35 Each set will be checked to see whether it contains all the k-1 of a 12 itemset The second conjunct in the condition on line 35 means all the itemsets in SI  si are the k-1 of a k-itemset This is because each pair of the k-1 of a k-itemset are different in two items In addition according to the defini 1371 


tion in 2 each atomic item should appear in an itemset only once e.g A V B,A v C is not a valid itemset as A appears twice Thus two dif ferent items should not have common atomic items Condition 221\221 3e E S.{SI  s C e\224 in line 35 means the subset of any element in S should not be in S e.g if A B A C B C is in S then A B A C should not be in S Each k-itemset has k distinct k-1 Hence in S only the sets which contain exactly k itemsets need to be considered These sets are used to form S\222 line 36 If a set in S\222 say ss with k ele ments itemsets\has k distinct items i.e  B I k in line 3G then ss must contain all the k-1 of a k-iteniset As the itemsets in ss are from Lk-1 all the itemsets in ss are large As a result the k-itemset becomes a candidate line 37 Here is an example showing how candzdate-gen works Assume that L2  A B A B v C A 01 B v c D From line 35 S  A B A,D A B V C A 01 B V Cl D A,B},{A,BvC}}isnotinS,as BandBVC A,D},{BvC,D isnot in S as A,D have B in common BVC D C ABVC A 01 BVC D holds Each candidate in C is a 3-itemset i.e each candi date has three items A B A D only has two elements Thus A B A D cannot contain all the 2-subsets of any Pitemset As a result A B A D will not be considered further As only A B V C A D B V C D has three elements and contains three distinct items i.e A B v C and D according to line 36 S\222  A,B~C},{A,~},{B~C Hence, from line 37 the candidate in C3 is A B V The procedure generating the candidates in 3 consists of two phases First in the join phase the large itemsets generated at the k-1 step are 223joined\224 together to form k-itemsets Then in the prune phase the k-1 of all the k-itemsets gen erated at the join phase are calculated If a k-1 subset of a k-itemset is not one of the large itemsets obtained at the previous step then the k-itemset is removed from the candidate set In contrast procedure candzdate-gen in this paper only adds a k-itemset to the candidate set if all the C 0 k-1 of the k-itemset are large This avoids generating any k-itemset which will be deleted later Also it does not need to calculate the k-1 of any k-itemset Thus the scheme in this paper requires less computation than the one in 3 4 Conclusions The algorithm in this paper allows large itemsets to contain composite items This enables certain useful rules to be discovered in some applications Other work has presented algorithms for mining association rules in the presence of taxonomies over the items 5 GI In those algorithms a transaction is regarded as supporting the upper level of a hier archy if the transaction supports at least one item which is at a lower level in the hierarchy The algo rithms require the users to provide taxonomies If it is intended to investigate the possible relationships between some composite items e.g A V B,A v C and B V C and some atomic items then either sev eral taxonomies have to be provided or each pair of A B and C has to be placed under a hierarchy in a taxonomy In contrast the algorithm in this paper does not require the users to provide a taxonomy The users need only provide the set of atomic items in which they are interested From this set the composite items will be generated by the algorithm automati cally Thus the algorithm in this paper is both easier to use and more flexible References R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases Proc of ACM SIGMOD Conference R Agrawal and J Shafer Parallel mining of as sociation rules IBM Research Report RJl0004 1996 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining associations rules Proc of 10th Int Con ference on VLDB 1994 R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining sequential patterns Proc of 11th Int Conference on Data Engzneerang 1995 M Holsheimer M Kersten H Mannila and H Toivonen, A perspective on database and data mining Technical report CS-R9531 CWI The Netherlands 1995 R Srikant and R Agrawal, Mining generalised association rules Proc of 21st Int Conference on VLDB 1995 pp 207-216 1993 1372

association-cube, base-cube and population-cube are derived from the volume cube; the confidence-cube is derived from the association cube and population cube and the support-cube is derived from the associationcube and base-cube. The slices of these cubes shown in Figure 2 correspond to the same list of values in dimension merchant, time, area and customer_group  Multidimensional and multilevel rules Representing association rules by cubes and underlying cubes by hierarchical dimensions, naturally supports multidimensional and multilevel rules. Also these rules are well organized and can be easily queried  First, the cells of an association cube with different dimension values are related to association rule instances in different scopes. In the association cube CrossSales cell CrossSales product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222  customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221Los Angeles\222, time 221Jan98\222 represents the following multidimensional rule x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x,\221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant = \221Sears\222, area 221Los  Angeles\222, time =  \221Jan98\222 If this cell has value 4500, and the corresponding cell in the population cube has value 10000, then this rule has confidence 0.45 Next as the cubes representing rules can have hierarchical dimensions, they represent not only multidimensional but also multi-level association rules. For example, the following cells CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222, customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221 California 222, time 221Jan98\222 CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222, customer_group 221engineer\222, merchant \221Sears\222, area \221 California 222, time 221 Year98 222 represent association rules at different area levels \(i.e the city level and the state level\d different time levels \(i.e., the month level, the year level x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant =  \221Sears\222, area 221 California 222, time =  \221Jan98\222 x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222  275 customer_group = \221engineer\222, merchant =  \221Sears\222, area 221 California 222, time =  \221 Year98 222 The cell CrossSales\(product \221A\222, product2 \221B\222,  customer_group 221top\222, merchant \221top\222, area \221top\222,  time \221top\222 represents the customer-based cross-sale association rule for all customers, merchants, areas, and times in the given range of these dimensions, expressed as x 316 Customers: buy_product\(x, \221A\222 336 buy_product\(x, \221B\222 4.3  Generating Association Rule Related Cubes The basic task of our OLAP based association rule mining framework, either at the GDOS or at an LDOS is to convert a volume cube i.e. the cube representing the purchase volumes of customers dimensioned by product  area etc, into an association cube a base cube and a population cube These cubes are then used to derive the confidence cube and the support cube of multidimensional association rule instances. The following general steps are involved in cross-sale association rule mining 267  Roll up the volume cube SaleUnits by aggregating it along merchant, time, area dimensions 267  Derive cube NumOfBuyers from SaleUnits based on the antecedent condition SaleUnits 0 267  Populate cube NumOfShoppers by the counts of customers dimensioned by merchant, area  time not by product\at satisfy the antecedent conditions 267  Derive cube CrossSales from SaleUnits based on the association conditions SaleUnits  product  p 1  0 and SaleUnits  product2  p 2 0 267  Derive cube Confidence and cube Support using cell-wise operations 214  Confidence = CrossSales  NumOfBuyers 214  Support  CrossSales  NumOfShoppers  Cubes Confidence  Support  CrossSales are dimensioned by product  product2 customer_group,merchant  time, area NumOfBuyers is dimensioned by product  customer_group, merchant time, area  NumOfShoppers is dimensioned by customer_group, merchant  time, area Rules with confidence and support that exceed specified thresholds  may be considered interesting 4.4. Rules with Conjoint Items Cubes with conjoint dimensions can be used to represent refined multidimensional association rules For example, using OLAP, we can derive association rules across time  Time-variant or temporal association rules such as 


x 316 Customers buy_product\(x,\222 A\222, \221 Jan98\222  336 buy _product\(x, \221B\222, \221 Feb98\222   275 area = \221Los Angeles\222 can be used to answer such questions as \223 How are  the sales of B in Feb98  associated with the sales of A in Jan98 224 The items in this rule are value pairs of dimensions product and time In order to specify this kind of association rule we introduce a conjoint dimension product, time and mirror it with dimension product2, time2 This allows a cell in the association cube to cross two time values. Accordingly, the cubes related to association rule mining are defined as follows Association cube  CrossSales.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.2  \(<product, time>, customer_group merchant, area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.2  \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube Confidence.2 \(<product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area Support  cube  Support.2  product, time>, <product2, time2 customer_group, merchant, area  The steps for generating these cubes are similar to the ones described before. The major differences are that a cell is dimensioned by, besides others product, time and product2, time2 and the template of the association condition is  SaleUnit s  product p 1 time t 1  0 and  SaleUnits  product2 p 2 time2 t 2  0 where, in any instance of this condition, the time expressed by the value of time2 is not contained in the time expressed by the value of time The template of the antecedent condition is SaleUnits   product p 1 time t 1  0 In general, other dimensions such as area may be added to the conjoint dimensions to specify more refined rules 4.5. Functional Association Rules A multidimensional association rule is functional if its predicates include variables, and the variables in the consequent are functions of those in the antecedent.  For example, functional association rules can be used to answer the following questions, where a_month and a_year are variables q  What is the percentage of people in California who buy a printer in the next month after they bought a PC x 316 Customer buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ month 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_month+1  275 area = \221California\222 q  What is the percentage of people who buy a printer within the year when they bought a PC  x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x, \221PC\222, a_ year 336 buy_product\(x, \221printer\222, a_year 275 area = \221California\222 To be distinct, we call the association rules that are not functional as instance association rules; e.g x 316 Customer: buy_product\(x,\222 PC\222, \221Jan98\222 336 buy_product\(x,\222 printer\222, \221Feb98\222  275 area =  \221California\222 Time variant, functional association rules can be derived from time variant, instance association rules through cube restructuring. Let us introduce a new dimension time_delta that has values one_day, two_day 205, at the day level, and values one_month, two_month, \205, at the month level, etc. Then, let us consider the following functional association rule related cubes Association cube  CrossSales.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta  Population cube  NumOfBuyers.3 \(product, customer_group, merchant area Base cube  NumOfShoppers.3 \( customer_group, merchant, area Confidence cube  Confidence.3 \(product, product2, customer_group merchant, area, time_delta Support cube  Support.3 \(product, product2, customer_group, merchant area, time_delta The association cube CrossSales.3  can be constructed from CrossSales.2   The cell values of CrossSales.2  in the selected time and time2 ranges are added to the corresponding cells of CrossSales.3 For example, the count value in cell  CrossSales.2\(<PC, Jan98>, <printer, Feb98>\205 is added to cell \(bin CrossSales.3\(PC, printer, one_month,\205 


It can also be added to cell CrossSales.3\(PC, printer one_year,\205 5  Distributed and Incremental Rule Mining There exist two ways to deal with association rules 267  Static that is, to extract a group of rules from a snapshot, or a history, of data and use "as is 267  Dynamic that is, to evolve rules from time to time using newly available data We mine association rules from an e-commerce data warehouse holding transaction data. The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
