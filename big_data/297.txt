Mining Fuzzy Association Rules in Incomplete Databases Dragos Arotaritei Department of Computer Science and Engineering Aalborg University Esbjerg Niels Bohrs Vej 8,6700 Esbjerg Denmark dragos@cs.aue.auc.dk Abstract  Mining quantitative association rules is a particular subject of interest in fuzzy set application theory However the theory generally applies to a transactional database with no missing values A predictive algorithm is proposed in this paper in order to extrapolate interpolate\the unknown values A fuzzy data mining algorithm is used 
to discover fuzzy association rules over the extended database with filled predictive values I INTRODUCTION Finding association rules in very large database systems is an important data mining task The usual model for developing algorithms to discover association rules is the basket market The algorithms developed for these transactional databases usually do not deal with missing values The major scope of discovering association rules in databases is to find some hidden, possibly useful information from the databases A common approach is to search for association rules in large amounts of data collected in a supermarket basket database. The problem of mining association rules was first introduced by Agrawal I support and confidence 
An association rule bread  bufter sup  IO and conf  20 means that 20 of transactions contain both bread and buffer and 10 percent of transactions that contains bread contains buffer also. The mining association rules problem can be defined as finding all the rules with a minimum support and a minimum confidence defined by the user Some approaches append additional evaluation measures weights for importance of the rule, taxonomies for hierarchical levels etc in order to improve the quality of the algorithms for searching rules according to enriched criteria The main assumption in these algorithms is that 
we have no missing value null values\Therefore we do not deal with it However in real databases it is common to have missing values, and in some situations this fact is oAen inevitable due to disjunctive information, partial knowledge, accidentally damage of some records or outer-join operations in relational databases \(extension ofjoin operation in order to deal with missing values Several solutions to deal with missing values has been proposed 3]-[5 IS]-191 23 The simplest solution is to eliminate the records that have unknown null\value or to Two measures are used in evaluation of a rule X+Y 
replace them with one value predicted fiom current knowledge extracted from the database The probability distribution of the unknown values are deduced from known values using Bayesian networks  1 I The closest value can be chosen or one possible value is chosen from division of the examples in fractions A probabilistic approach based on attribute distribution is described in 13 The results are compared with three other approaches to incompleteness: the missing values are ignored, only certain information available for missing values, and no missing values exist \(complete database queries over incomplete databases is proposed in 9 Many valued logic for improving the results is used 3-valued Solutions to 
the problem of generating decision tree Different kinds of answers representing sure information in logic decision rules using a training set with unknown values was proposed in 14 The value of an attribute is suggested to be predicted from the values of other attributed and the class information The solution to induce rules fiom available data and using them to fill the missing values is a good option taken into account by some papers. Based on this idea and using as start point the Apriori algorithm 8 an improve6 suhtion is proposed in 8 The algorithm uses fewer and more relevant 
rules according to the criteria of usefulness in prediction of missing values and not in actual prediction 8 This solution reduces the large of rules due to missing values considerable An approach where the missing values are estimated is presented in  121 A decision tree for filling missing attributes is build based on examples with known attributes The order that is followed in construction and filling the tree is based on the mutual information concept from information theory Experiments on tree repositories with missing attributes Soybean BreastCWand Mushrooms are presented 12 simplest methods used in machine learning algorithms 
is proposed in  The basic idea is to split the database in several databases that have only valid values \(without missing values New definition of support and confidence are given in order to deal with missing values. The algorithms used in 2 were modified in order to compute efficient association rules for incomplete databases In the author analyzes the properties of databases with missing values A pessimistic and optimistic estimation both of support and confidence rules are proposed Another treatment of the missing values, based on of the 0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02,2002 IEEE 261 


Definitions of expected values of support and confidence based on the records with no missing values is given. Some properties of itemsets and association rules are guaranteed by this approach Other approaches, using rough sets are proposed in  151  and 17 Two algorithms in the frame of rough sets IAprioriCertain and IAprioriPossible are proposed in  151 The algorithms use the specification given for pessimistic support and confidence threshold. By this approach the authors showed that hypothetical rules applied to an incomplete system can resolve or decrease the uncertainty grade of a rule deduced from the system In this paper we present an algorithm for mining association rules in the frame of fuzzy sets. Our work is close to the work presented in 15 and 16 However, our proposal is based on fuzzy set theory and not rough set theory. Both fuzzy sets and rough sets model different types of uncertainty IO The concept of approximation given by the equivalence relation R and the approximation space in rough set cannot be replaced by a similar membership function in the sense of fuzzy sets  This means that a simple translation of results from rough sets to fuzzy sets is difficult to do or maybe not realistic to do Therefore our work concentrates on the use of fuzzy sets in discovering the association rules from incomplete databases with quantitative attributes The rest of the paper is organized as follow In the next section, the problem of incomplete databases is introduced In the third section we present association rules from a fuzzy set perspective. The algorithm used to find association rules in databases with missing values is presented in the next section. Experimental results are described in section five followed by our conclusions 11 INCOMPLETE DATABASES There are many proposals to deal with incomplete information or incomplete databases In the data mining research area an important problem is the discovery of association rules Many papers treat this problem in binary quantitative ZO qualitative databases using crisp fuzzy or rough techniques Missing values in databases are sometimes inevitable and the discovering of association rules with missing attributes is a real necessity When the missing values are categorical e.g size of one product: small, medium, large, very large\and the solution to deal with missing attributes is predictive, a cnmmon approach is to consider all the possibilities equal or weighted probable in the association rule algorithm The decision table DT can be expanded in different ways but the main idea is to have for each record transaction\a number of transactions equal with the number of all possible combinations from domain of attributes for the missing values and the rest of attributes remaining unchanged When the attributes are quantitative and the domain of values for the missing value is known to be continuous a sub-domain of real numbers  the above approach is ineffective and cannot be applies due to non numerable property of an real interval numbers For example in Table 1 the above approach means that for the missing attribute ATRI in transaction 6 we will count all the four possible attributes as equal probable or weighted if some additional knowledge about distribution of attributes are available in the association rule algorithm TABLE 1 A DECISlON TABLE WITH MISSlNG ATTRIBUTE VALUES T ATRI ATRZ ATR3 ATR4 C 1 small yes 8.5 A 1 2 small no 3.5 A 1 3 large yes 3.9 A 0 4 medium no 6.5 B 1 5 large yes 7.2 A 1 6 no 2.2 2003 0 7 small no A 0 8 verylarge  3.4 C I However we cannot apply the same method if we take into account the attribute ATR3 in transaction 7 Due to the uncountable property of an interval of real numbers we cannot take into account a finite reasonable number of possible values without additional considerations A predictive metbcd seem to be a reasonable way to deal with continuous missing attribute values, but some additional restriction can restrict this approach We propose a predictive method in order to try to fill the missing values where it is possible using a predictive method based on neighborhoods The main idea is to use close transactional neighborhoods in order to predict probable values for missing values However, if the number of missing values is too great the method is ineffective because we cannot produce knowledge from nothing We will use a common notation in the remainder of the paper We denote the information table IT the subset of the table that have no missing values and we denote by If the full information table with missing values In order to find association rules we will deal with a sure support sSup and sure confidence Con based on IT and a possible predicted support pSup and confidence pConA based of an subset of IT possible full IT  The subset of IT is constructed by filling the missing values with predicted possible values in a step before the algorithm of finding rules The above measures are defined in a classic manner we denoted by A the extended values of attribute with predicted values sSup  sup A n B sConf A 0-7803-7280-8/02/s10.00 02002 IEEE 268

Due to hard predictable distribution of the continuous values in a real database, this method is not suitable In the following we will use the notation used in 6 7 and 22 and we will consider only convex membership function The fuzzy association rules found are typically illustrated in categorical measures prediction of missing values where this is possible an extended database is created using the old database and the predicted values discovery of fuzzy rules from extended database 223lfengine-size is High and horsepower is Medium then the price is High\224 The database is fuzzified using a manual partition of the triangular fuzzy membership function An automatic procedure to find out medoids and optimal number of membership functions as in 7 was used also in our experiments A trapezoidal membership function could also be used, but in this case it is possible to have the value 2231\224 of the membership function corresponding to more values of arguments The main steps of the finding association rules are the steps used in 7 The only change is that we used a normalized value of the a-cuts as follow 0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02,2002 IEEE 269

Some limitations of the proposed approach are evidently If a transaction has too many missing values for almost all the attributed the utility of the method decreases dramatically We cannot predict useful information if we have no minimal information attributes for all the transactions, the result of the method will he that some values are predicted but the rules discovered by this method are too few and not corresponding to reality because the knowledge was acquired by a very large ignorance Also if the missing values tend to cover a large number of Figure 1 Numberofmles We can see from the figure that the algorithm give at least the same number of rules as the original database The simple median predictor can give in some distribution of the attributes a lower numher of rules depending on how good an approximation can he considered for the mean value as representative for the vector attribute A problem could arise in cases where we use a predictor related to dimension of the attribute vector \(the rows in the database If the number of attributes are relatively small order of tens\the predictors like IBL our predictor neural networks etc can be considered as a satisfactory solution However if the number of attributes is relatively high hundreds of attributes\it is hard to build an interpolator vectors of 800 elements for example using a neural network A hierarchical solution was chosen as the simplest possible solution \(even though this is not optimal in order to deal with it even some experiment using PCA principal component analysis\are in progress A small improvement was taken into account in order to store the fuzzy set transformed In the Table 2 fiom 6 after the first intermediary step taking into account only 10 cases 5 attributes and a partition of 3 membership functions on each attributes we have a total of 150 values from where 83 values are zero 55,5 Therefore it will be useful to store these results in a tree where each node stores attribute index and each leaf has 3 values \(transaction id nonzero value scalar cardinality Even though it seem to be a sensible improvement \(based on percent of values reduced that we can combine practical implementation showed that the speed of the complete implementation increase only with 2.91 for a synthetic database with lOOk and 100 attributes uniform distributed over the entire database VI CONCLUSIONS A predictive method for dealing with missing continuous attribute values is proposed in this paper The results are encouraging but some results showed that the computational effort could be large in order to discover only a few additional rules in comparison by the solution of ignoring the missing values 0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 02002 IEEE 270 


Preliminary results on tests using a real database are presented The method is clearly depending on the distribution of missing values in the databases according to transactions and attributes structure A few possible directions of investigation can be suggested The improvement of predictive tool could be one If the number of input in the ARMA model is large \(like in a base with 500 attributes for example simpler methods are necessary A better solution to select the neighborhoods of pattern can be developed Some extension to multivariate times series could also be a possibility for future development ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to thank our colleague Uffe Kock Wiil for providing helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper References I R Agrawal T Imielinski, and A Swami, \223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 Proc.
