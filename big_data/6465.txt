to be interpreted by the clinic i an s  within a short peiod of time  To achieve this goal a  bioinformatics platform that can automat es  this process  is yet to be developed  To fu lfill this gap, w e develope d  O nline D iagnosis S ystem \(ODS which is implemented as a web server and support s  the commonly used ABI trace file format generated from Sanger sequencing   ODS seamlessly integrates useful functions covering base  calling, Small Nucleotide Variant \(SNV\dentification   and  comprehensive SNV annotation It also 
allow s  the clinic i an s  to manually inspect the quality of the identified SNVs  when generating the final report  ODS can therefore signifi cantly  reduce  the data analysis time   allow ing the completion of  the genetic testing in a timely manner  Keywords 227 Online Diagnosis System genetic testing   Sanger seq uen cing  small nucleotid e  variation  I   I NTRODUCTION  Molecular genetic test ing or gene testing  examine s  single genes or short lengths of DNA to identify small nucleotide 
variations SNVs or mutations that lead to a genetic disorder  The results of a genetic test ing  can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition Currently, at  least 2 000 genetic tests are in use, and more are being developed  detailed information  of which  can be found at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genetictesting.html   As the most widely used genetic testing method Sanger sequencing is a method of DNA sequencing  by selective ly  incorporati ng  of chain terminating   dideoxynuc leotides  by DNA polymerase  during in vitro  DNA replication   1 3   It requires the individual am plification and sequencing of each 
exon of a set of genes to identify the causative SNVs   The data analysis of Sanger sequencing based genetic test ing typically involv es  se ver al  steps i  processing of the raw sequencing data  for base calling and quality control  ii  identifying SNVs from the processed sequencing data; and iii  annotating the identif ied SNVs and evaluat ing  their pathogenic  effects on tested gene  T he steady increase of the demand s  for Sanger sequencing based genetic test ing  has raised the issue  of inefficiencies in data analysis that associat 
e  with manual inspection of sequencing raw data i.e electropherograms  SNV identification   and extracting annotations for each identified SNV from different annotation sources R edu cing the time needed to interpret the results of each amplimer  is critical to create  a practical genetic test Seamless  i ntegration and a utomation of  the Sanger sequencing data  analysis including raw data analysis quality control, file handling, variant identi fication, and variant annotation   will largely improve the turn around time for the genetic testing and ultimately reduce the costs of th e  test s  To this end we implemented Online Diagnosis System  ODS   
a web based tool for Sanger sequencing based gene tic test ing, which can speed up the data analysis and interpretation process  through a n automatic bioinformatics web server  We also demonstrated  the usage and performance of ODS using real clinical data T he results indicate that ODS can be used to streamline the analysis of clinical Sanger sequencing data with the ability to accurately interrogate electropherograms  for base  calling identify SNVs and provide comprehensive annotation s for those identified SNVs, therefore serves as  a novel  useful  tool to aid  the clinician  to 
complete  the genetic testing in a timely manner  II  D ESIGN AND IMPLEMENTA TION  A  Workflow of ODS  ODS is an integrated, easy to use bioinformatics platform for Sanger sequencing based genetic test ing It consists of the following major components \(Fig. 1   Fig.1.

 Applied Biosystems Gene tic Analysis Data File Format In order to run ODS, at least one sequencing file is required to be uploaded. There is no up limit for the file s to be uploaded   To detect SNVs, ODS first performs the base  calling for all sequencing raw data files uploa ded using Phred software  4  5   T he nucleotides on the 3\222 end of each sequence with poor qualities are automatic ally trimmed and the overall quality of each sequence is also evaluated  T he resulted sequences are then aligned to the reference genome \(NCBI 37/UCSC hg19 using BLAST  6  7   and the alig nment results are visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser  8   and  side by side comp arisons to the reference genome B ased on the alignment results, ODS employs in house algorithm s  to screen both homozygous including substitutions and microindels\and heterozygous SNVs \(substitutions F inally, SNVs in both categories are merged  into  the final list  of  identified SNV s  Fig. 1 A    ii SNV annotation module In this module SNVs in the final list are independent ly  annotat ed using different sources and approaches. First  the location of each SNV will be examined, i.e  i f it lie s in the exon regions of Ensemb l   9     RefSeq  10   genes or if it falls into any important regulatory Cp G island s  11  Seco nd, it will be annotated with the public available SNP or mutation databases such as dbSNP database   12   and Human Gene Mutation Database \(HGMD   13   Lastly, the potential pathogenic effect of the identified SNVs will be evaluated by SIFT \(Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant software  14   and the annotation obtained from th e O nline Mendelian Inheritance in Ma n \(OMIM  15   record s  Fig   1 B    iii  SNV val idation module  In this module the final results, and the sequencing data statistics will be summarized and presented as  tables and figures \(visualization In addition  ODS provides the functions for clinicians to validate and comment on ea ch SNV manually  in order to further assess  the quality of the identified SNVs Fig. 1 C   B  Implementation and availability   ODS is implemented as a web based system freely available  at http://sunlab.lihs cuhk.edu.hk/ODS   for academic users   A complete manual and example s  for several genetic diseases are also provided on th e  website   Fig. 2  W eb interface of ODS for uploading Sanger sequencing data files and job submission   To use  ODS, the user s  need to  provide Sanger sequencing files in ABI format \(i.e., files with extension of abi or  ab1  through a web interface Fig 2 where the user can set the Job identification, input the  test gene information \(such as  gene name R efSeq  gene identification or Ensembl gene identification\ if available and upload the  sequencing data file one by one  by using the \223Add another file\224 button U sers can upload as many sequencing files as they need  After clicking the \223 GO ODS 224 button the pa rameters and the uploaded sequencing data  files will be sen t  to ODS for further processing  III  R ESULTS AND EXMAPLES   To demonstrate the usage and performance of ODS, we applied ODS on Sanger sequencing data sequenced from two real clinical samples. More spec ifically, we tested ODS on patient samples with two different diseases i  McLeod syndrome, and ii  hypercalcemia  A  Sanger sequencing based g enetic testing for McLeod syndrome  McLeod syndrome \(or McLeod  phenomenon MLS is a genetic disorder  that may affect a patie nt 222 s  blood  brain  peripheral nerves  muscle  and heart   16  17  It is caused by a variety of recessively inherited i.e., both copies of the gen es are affected mutations in the XK gene  on the X chromosome  The gene is responsible for producing the Membrane Transport P rotein XK  also known as Kx anti gen a se condary supportive protein for the Kell  antigen  on the red blood cell  surface  To test and  identify causal SNVs responsible for this disease by Sanger sequencing  s everal pair s  of primers w ere  designed to target three exons of XK gene  As a result a total of 10 ampliers w as sequenced W hen ODS was applied on th e  d a t a  it  first made base call ing  for each nucleotide position in amplicons and generated the summary table s  for i  base calling  Fig 3 A 223Base  call ing  summary\224 table  which includes the sequence length of the raw sequenc e  after trimming as well as  the overall qua lity evaluation  for all  the trace files  provided   ii  alignment Fig   3 A 223Alignment summary\224 table\, where the actual aligned regions in the sequenced amplicons and the aligned positions on the reference genomes were reported  After generating the se two  summar y tables ODS visualized the amplicons on each tested exon  of the target XK gene in which the blue box represents the reverse  strand amplicons and the red box represents  the forward  strand amplicons \(Fig   3 B After the visualization for each exon  intron of the target gene the number of amplicons  designed to cover that region   the absolute and the proportion of the exons/intron s  sequenced and the SNV s  identified within each  exon intron  were reported  in a \223Gene report\224 table  Fig. 3C   For e ach identif ied  SNV its  associated information such as chromosome number   genomics location the total number amplicon file s  where the same SNV w as identified reference and observed nucleotide sequence pattern the SNV types e.g. deletion/substitution   and the cli nician\222s comment of the identified SNV were also reported  in \223SNV report\224 table Fig. 3C  In addition for each SNV a hyperlink under 223 Genomic locus 224  column was also implemented for users to further navigate the SNV annotation information  Lastly, t he OM IM \(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man   database  records of the target test gene were also listed in 223OMIM annotation\224 table Fig. 3C     48

This deletion is also predicted b y SIFT as \223damaging\224 since it causes a frame shift affecting around 36% amino acids of the translated peptide  Further more this 5 bp deletion has been independently validated by Man et al  as a novel causal mutation c.856_860delCTCTA\ in  the reference se quence NM_021083.2  for MLS   17  However in this example ODS also reported a false positive 5 bp deletion as chrX:3758723 4  TACTC deletion  d u e to the alignment ambiguity   for example, t he dinucleotides 223TA\224 can be ambiguously aligned on  both  the left and right boundary of th e deletion region as showed in Fig 5  This deletion is in deed  the same as the deletion reported as chrX:375823 4  when being carefully inspected manually, suggesting the importance of allowing clinicians to manually inspect the identified SNV             Fig. 5. Illustration of a  fals ely  identified SNV due to the ambiguous  alignment   B  Sanger sequencing based genetic testing for hypercalcemia  Hypercalcemia is a disease condition in which an elevated calcium \(Ca 2 level is detected  in the blood  18   In this example, customized Sanger sequencing based genetic testing was designed for a patient suffering from high calcium level in blood  which may be caused by SNVs in CASR gene   18    Sanger sequencing has been done b y design ing 20 pairs of primers targeting all  6 coding exons of the CASR gene  After applying ODS on this dataset  6  SNVs 2  heterozygous and 4  homozygous substitutions were  identified Fig   6 C   All of the identified SNVs were  confirmed as true SNV s  by clinician 222 s manual  inspection  Further inspection identified o ne homozygous substitution at chr3 122003832  reference G observed C Fig. 7 A  which can be detected in both sequencing files covering this site with high quality signal; it is located at  the 6 th  CDS \(or 7 th  exon\ of the CASR gene; it is annotated  in dbSNP as rs1801726  as well as recorded in HGMD as CM045983  and associated with \223Increased blood ionised calcium level\224 suggesting this SNV is correlated with the hypercalcemia phenotype It c auses a  substitution on the 1013 th  amino acid of the CASR protein from E \(Glutamic acid to Q \(Glutamine  based on SIFT prediction  Fig. 7B      49

ODS result s for the genetic testing of h ypercalcemia     Fig. 7  A\ Visualization and \(B\ annotation for SNV chr3:122003832  identified from the genetic testing of h ypercalcemia   Furthermore, n o other SNVs were  found for the CASR gene of this patient by manual  inspection   indicating for this sample, the sensitivity and specificity of ODS are both 100  IV  D ISCUSSION  The increasing large volume of data generated  from Sanger sequencing based genetic testing demands  the clinician s  to analyze and interpret the data with in  a very short period of time  However  without using an  automatic bioinformatics data analysis tool even for a trained clinician it can easily take at least one working day to analyze one genetic testing dataset  which contain s 10 sequencing files for  a  gene with 5 exons  both forwa rd chain and the reverse chain of each exon are sequenced  W ith the help of ODS it  can be shortened to less than half an hour, which significantly facilitate the application of large scale Sanger sequencing based genetic testing    Compared to the  current software  used in the testing there are certain advantages of ODS  i  t o our knowledge, O DS is the only software that integrates SNV detection and comprehensive SNV annotation for Sanger sequencing bas ed genetic testing data analysis Comparing to the commercially  available software, such as  Mutation Suveyor \(Softgenetics   which is designed only for SNV detection and Alamut Interactive Biosoftware   that is implemented only for SNV annotation   ODS seaml essly integrates those two functions into one system which makes it possible for automating such data analysis process   ii  a s a web based system, ODS doe s not   50 


require any installation procedure   therefore   it is platform independent T he users can even use ODS and view the analysis result on their mobile devices  iii  ODS is easy to use As illustrated above  raw sequencing data  can be upl oaded  without requirement of setting any parameters which is normally difficult  for clinic i a ns   vi the high cost of other commercia l software has limited their usage among academic users  ODS, in contrast is freely available    ODS is carefully configured and adjusted  to th e optimal  performance  to achieve the high sensitivity while maintaining a reasonable specificity  in detecting SNVs  Due to the limitations of the Sanger sequencing, during the SNV identification, most of the false positive SNVs identified  are associated with base calling errors, low sequencing quality, and alignment ambiguity which pose  great challenges for the identification of true SNVs. To overcome these difficulties ODS appl ies several strategies to control the false positive SNV calls. For instance, onl y the sequenced regions with good qualities are considered for SNV calling; candidate SNVs with very low quality scores are automatically filtered out  those SNVs with poor quality scores are marked with distinct  colors To facilitate clinician\222s decision  making for each called SNVs raw sequencing signals of all the files covering that site as well as a side by side alignment are  also plotted  to help them determine whether it is a true SNV site or a false positive   In the future, to further improve the performance of ODS we will  add  some useful  features to  support  heterozygous indel detection  and to integrat e  more  tools for SNV annotation and functional prediction \(e.g., PolyPhen   19  We believe that  ODS can  provide  an easy to use  and one step solution  for Sanger sequencing data analysis  thus will become a critical tool for helping clinicians and researchers in  the genetic testing   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors thank M s  Xianlu Peng for her critical reading of this manuscript This work is supported by G eneral Research Fund \(G RF   CUHK473 713  from the University Grants Committee, Hong Kong SAR  China   R EFERENCES    F.

 6  salinity patterns These currents are derived from satellite sea level and surface wind measurements via www.oscar.noaa.gov  Combining these data sets in this way allows scientists to study the direct link between salinity patterns and ocean currents  As noted above another important element of the Aquarius microwave sensor is the scatterometer This sensor measures the radar backscatter at L band 1.26 gigahertz frequency from the sea surface simultaneously with the radiometer emissivity measurements This backscatter signal is proportional to the strength of the surface wind and waves roughness\ The Aquarius scatterometer has had exceptionally stable performance with calibration changes less than 0.1 decibels over a year, allowing highly sensitive detection of sea surface roughness  Areas of higher wind speeds are evident such as the tropical trade wind zones and the storm belts in the sub polar latitudes and lower winds in the subtropics Tropical or extra t ropical storms can also be identified, such as Prapiroon in the western Pacific Without some proxy surface roughness accurate salinity retrievals would not be possible Numerical wind forecasts have limitations because of their lack of accuracy and coinc idence in time with the satellite measurements. Aquarius solves this problem with simultaneous measurements that significantly improve the accuracy of the salinity data  The most interesting findings came from the scientists at JPL   Tong Lee Gary Lagerloe f Michelle M Gierach Hsun Ying Kao Simon Yueh and Kathleen Dohan 322Aquarius reveals salinity structure of tropical instability waves\323 Geophysical Research Letters  VOL 39 L12610 doi:10.1029/2012GL052232, 2012  on the s alinity structure of Tropica l instability waves  TIW This was the f irst Aquarius Science Application Publication   The paper documented SSS  measurements from the Aquarius/SAC D satellite during September 320 December 2011 provide the first satellite observations of the salinity struct ure  of TIWs  in the Pacific The related SSS anomaly ha s a magnitude of approximately 0.5 PSU Differen t from SST  and sea surface height anomaly SSHA\where TIW related propagating signals are stronger a few degrees away from the equator, the SSS signature  of TIWs is largest near the equator in the eastern equatorial Pacific where salty South Pacific water meets the fresher Inter tropical Convergence Zone water. The dominant westward propagation speed of SSS near the equator is approximately 1 m/s. This is twice as fast as the 0.5 m/s TIW speed widely reported in the literature typically from SST and SSHA away from the equator. This difference is attributed to the more dominant 17 day TIWs near the equator that have a 1 m/s dominant phase speed and the stro nger 33 day TIWs away from the equator that have a 0.5 m/s dominant phase speed The results demonstrate the important value of Aquarius in studying TIWs   TIWs are westward prop agating planetary scale waves that exist on both sides of the equatorial cold  tongues in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans e.g Legeckis 1977 Legeckis and Reverdin 1987 Chelton et al 2000   T h e y  a r e  c a u s e d  b y  barotropic and baroclinic instability associated with the meridional and vertical shear of the equatorial current syst ems e.g Philander 1978 Masina et al 1999 Grodsky et al     T he  dom i na nt  c ha r a c t e r i s t i c s  of  T I W s  a r e  1000 320 2000 km wavelengths 20 320  40 day periods and 0.3 320 0.5 m/s phase speeds with faster speeds in the Pacific than in the Atlantic e.g., Qiao and Weisberg, 1995; Chelton et al., 2000; Polito et al 2001   T h e s t r o n g er  s h ear  o f  eq u at o r i al  cu r r en t s  i n  t h e Pacific results in more energetic TIWs, whereas TIWs are less energetic in the Atlantic due to weaker current shear. TIWs are stronger to the n orth of the equatorial cold tongues in the Pacific and Atlantic in association with stronger shear in the northern edge of the cold tongues In the Pacific TIWs are most active during boreal fall and winter when the equatorial current shear is largest. Du ring El Ni\226o when the cold tongue is weak or entirely disappears, TIWs are suppressed. During La Ni\226a when the cold tongue and the related current shear are intense, TIWs become unusually vigorous. TIWs are found to play important roles in ocean dynamics  e.g Baturin and Niiler 1997 Grodsky et al 2005 Jochum and Murtugudde 2006 Menkes et al 2006 Kim et al   oc e a n atmosphere coupling [Xie et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000; Chelton et al 2001 Yu and Liu 2003   an d  m ar i n e b i o g eo ch em i s t r y  e g Feely et al 1994 Gorgues et al 2005 Evans et al    TIWs have been detecte d in various satellite measure ments of the ocean, most nota bly in SST  e.g., Legeckis, 1977; Chelton  et al., 2000   T h e S S T  p at t er n  as s o ci at ed  w i t h  t h e T I W s  af f ect s  the atmospheric boundary layer and modulates ocean surface wind as observed by scatterometers [e.g., Xie et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000; Chelton et al., 2001; Polito et al., 2001; Hashizume e t al 2001 Yu and Liu 2003  T h e  T I W  p a tte r n  is  a ls o  identifiable  in SSHA  e.g., Polito et al., 2001 a n d  c h l o ro p h y l l a chl a e.g Yoder et al 1994 Strutton et al 2001 McClain et al 2002   W i t h  t h e  a d v e n t  o f  s a t e l l i t e  s a l i n i t y  measurements it is now possible to analyze the salinity signature associated with TIWs This provides a significant new capability to the scope of TIW observations that has important implications to ocean circulation and climate

Lee and his team used the Aquarius data to provide a space borne analysis of SSS structure associated with TIWs aided by a multi sensor characterization of TIWs using other satellite derived prod ucts of SST, ocean surface currents, SSHA, ocean surface wind, and chl a  Figure 3 is an example showing the comparison of satellite observations of SSS SST surface currents SSHA ocean surface wind and chl a in the central to eastern tropical Pacific  The maps for SSS, SST, SSHA, wind speed, and chl a are 7 day averages centered on December 18 whereas the surface currents are 10 day average \(the average of two 5 day records\centered on December 18. The TIW pattern is clearly seen in SSS color shading  in Figures 3a 320 3d The SSS signature of TIWs aligns with that of SST contour in Figure 3a with the northward protrusion of higher SSS coinciding with that of lower SST. The well observed cusp  shaped pattern in SST is also evident in SSS, though not as  sharp as the SST cusps given lower resolution and smoothing of the SSS data Between the cusps there are clockwise  rotating patterns of surface curr ents \(vectors in Figure 3 b\ that also have a strong signature in SSHA contours in Figure 3c indicating  a significant contribution by geo  strophic flow These are features consistent with the anticyclonic vortices associated with TIWs that are sometimes referred to as tropical instability vortices [e.g., Flament et al   A s an early application of Aq uarius data to study dynamic features of the ocean observations of SSS by Aquarius provide d  the first space borne observations of the salinity structure associated with TIWs in the tropical Pacific The observed salinity stru cture of the TIWs is complemen tary to other satellite data such as SST, SSHA, surface cur rent, ocean surface wind, and chl a. Different from SST and SSHA, where the largest signals of TIWs are found a few degrees north of the equator the SSS signature of TIWs is strongest near the equ ator in the eastern equatorial Pacific where saltier South Pacific water meets fresher Inter tropical Convergence Zone water. The magnitude of SSS anomaly associa ted with TIWs is approximately 0.5 PSU larger in he east and smaller in the west The domina nt westward propagation speed is 1 m/s which is twice as fast as the 0.5 m/s TIW phase speed widely reported in the literature mostly based on observations of SST and SSHA away from the equator This is attributed to the more dominant 17 day TIWs near the  equator that have a 1 m/s dominant phase speed and the stronger 33 day TIWs away from the equator that have a 0.5 m/s dominant phase speed The Aquarius data provide a clear view of the salinity structure of the 17 day TIWs for the first time from space  Previous studies suggest that TIWs affect meridional transports of water properties specifically with regards to temperature and biology The SSS signature of TIWs as revealed by Aquarius indicates that TIWs are likely to play an important role in hemisph eric exchange of salt and freshwater, which on the longer time scales may influence the ocean circulation and hydrological cycle The observed SSS signature of TIWs comp lements in situ salinity obser vations by Argo floats which have inadequate sampling to  resolve TIWs The Aquarius data also provide additional constraints to models and as similation products in simulat ing TIWs and their consequences  Another interesting finding is found from the data from SSS  measurements from  Aquarius/SAC D satellite and S MOS  mission.  Measurements were used to document the freshening associated with the record 2011 Mississippi River flooding event in the Gulf of Mexico \(GoM\.

Higher con centrations of nutrients, sedime nts, and dissolved organic mat ter accompany freshwater discharge providing a major source of material into the GoM Such nutrient input from the Mississippi River has been a ssociated with enhanced chlo rophyl l a chl a concentrations and primary productivity in the northern GoM Lohrenz et al 1997; Rabalais et al   S out he r l y s out he a s t e r l y w i nds  a r e  prevalent during spring and summer months when Mississippi River discharge is maximal driving an eastw ard along shelf current that trans  ports freshwater, nutrients, chl a, sediments and dissolved or  ganic matter over the narrow Mississippi Alabama Florida shelf Morey et al 2003a 2003b   A  narrower shelf and deeper waters near the shelf edge permit floodwaters to inter  act with the general circulation of the GoM  In the GoM the ocean circulation is dominated by the Loop Current LC and its associated warm core anticyclonic and cold core cyclonic eddies   The position of the LC fluctuates within  the GoM but its most northward position occurs prior to shedding a large warm core eddy, which happens every 3 to 17 months Zavala Hidalgo et al 2006   T h e  L C  a n d  i t s  associated eddies remain offshore of the continental shelf, but can force exchanges of fluid across the continental shelf break These interactions are observed as plumes of water that have dif ferent properties than the sur rounding environment. Several studies have shown plumes of low salinity chlorophyll rich waters in the open GoM alo ng the West Florida Shelf and even as far as the Florida Straits and Gulf Stream linked to river discharge in the GoM i.e Mississippi Mobile and Apalachicola Rivers Ortner et al 1995 Gilbes et al 1996 Del Castillo et al 2001   S u c h  r i v e r  d i scharge studies primarily use a combination of satellite and in situ data but mainly rely upon satellite derived estimates of chl a sediments, and dissolved organic matter, rather than freshwater estimates from limited in situ salinity observations to c haracterize river plumes and describe their spatial and temporal variability  The  advent  of  satellite  salinity  measurements  provides a unique opportunity to analyze river discharge ev ents using global SSS  distributions. Aquarius/SAC D has been pro viding gl obal SSS maps on a weekly basis since late August 2011. The  SMOS  has also been providing global maps of SSS at a  10 day interval since 2010 As indicated earlier r ecent research has demonstrated the value of Aquarius data in studying large scale dynamic o cean features such as TIW  in the Pacific Lagerloef et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012  t h e  u s e  o f  S M O S  d a t a  in capturing seasonal features of the freshwater pool in the eastern Pacific Alory et al 2012   an d  t h e ap p l i cat i o n  o f  Aquarius and SMOS data to st udy the large plume of the Amazon/Orinoco River in the western tropical Atlantic Grodsky et al 2012  H o w e v e r  i t  re m a i n s  u n c l e a r a s  t o  whether Aquarius and SMOS data can be used to study salinity variation in marginal seas, such as Mississippi River di scharge in the GoM. This is primarily because of the smaller scales of salinity features in marginal seas and t he potential contami nation of the SSS signal near land such as radio frequency interference RFI and land effects on antenna sidelobes Subrahm anyam et al 2013   T h e l en g t h  o f  t h e Aquarius and SMOS satellite records currently limit the number of flood events that can be investigated Of the years available, 2011 was a record breaking flood year in the central United States comparable to major flood events in 1927 and 1993 Widespread flooding was attributed to excessive precipitation from major storm systems in combinatio n with extensive snowmelt T hey  demonstrate the applicability of Aquarius and SMOS data to  observe SSS freshening associ ated with the extreme Mississippi River flooding event in 2011, and assess the transit time of the associated low SSS signal in the GoM aided by multisensor characterization using other satellite derived products such as ocean surface currents and chl a  Aquarius and SMOS SSS data were used along with satellite derived chl a and ocean surface current products to study the salinity freshening associated with the record 2011 Mississippi River flooding event in the GoM. A time series of USGS daily mean disch arge revealed maximum flooding of the Mississippi River in May 2011. In asso  ciation with this discharge event SSS freshening was observed from June to August 2011 \(1 320 3 months after peak discharge\ in the GoM that then receded and became unidentifiable f rom satellite observations by October 2011 5  months after peak discharge\. Seasonal wind patterns and the general circulation of the GoM dramatically impacted the observed salinity response Specifically prevalent southerly/southeasterly winds drove an e astward along shelf current from May to September 2011 that transported freshwater along the Mississippi Alabama  Florida shelf. From June to September 2011, freshwater interacted with the LC and its associated mesoscale eddy field specifically a warm cor e eddy that was shed in the July 320 September time frame Low SSS values were entrained and transported along the eastern periphery of the LC and warm core eddy and were transported out of the GoM by October 2011 The observed salinity response from Aquarius  was consistent with SMOS SSS observations and MODIS chl a concentrations in terms of the pathway and transit time of the river plume spreading A passive tracer simulation confirmed the pathway and transit time of freshwater spreading observed by Aquarius  and SMOS in the GoM. This study is the first successful demonstration of the utility of Aquarius and SMOS data to study the salinity

Its passage left a 1.5 psu high haline wake covering >10 5 km 2 in its impact on density the equivalent of a 3.5 o C cooling\ due to mixing of the shallow BL. Destruction of this BL apparently decreased SST cooli ng in the plume and thus preserved higher SST and  evaporation than outside Com bined with SST the new satellite SSS data provide a new and better tool to monitor the plume extent and quantify tropical cyclone upper ocean responses with important implicat ions for forecasting  Because of the importance of latent heat release as an energy source hurricane strength depends  on changes in the underlying ocean thermal stratification [e.g., Shay et al., 2000; Saunders and Lea, 2008   Intense hurricane induced mi xing and upwelling act to entrain cool thermocline water into the mixed layer, leaving behind a cool wake of SST depressed by a few degrees, which reduces hurricane growth potential [e.g., Price, 1981; Bender and Ginis 2000  Zhu and Zhang      Passage  over freshwater plumes generally causes strengthening of hurricanes due to high SST Ffield 2007 Vizy and Cook   a nd m i ni m i z a t i on of  t he  c ool  w a ke  due  t o t he  pr e s e nc e  of the BL [Sengupta et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Balaguru et al 2012   T h es e produce nearly 50 increase in intensification rate over BL regions and occur in 10 320 20 of tropical cyclone cases worldwide Balaguru et al 2012  b u t are more probable 68 for the most intense category 5 hurricanes Ffield   T hey  combine new ly available SSS from the Aquarius/SAC D and SMOS missions together with other in situ and remote sensing observations to explore the impact of the Amazon/Orinoco plume on spatial and temporal sig  natures of SSS and SST after the passage of hurricane Kati a in fall 2011 They  expect that new ability to map the plume more precisely with satellite SSS will benefit hurricane forecasting when it is evident that the trajectory will intersect the plume at some stage   Unlike SST widely available from remote sensing SSS is relatively sparse and its response to passing storms is often overlooked Recognition of the impact of hurricane on a BL goes back at least to sample profile observations of Price 1981 s h o w i n g  t h e  b reakdown of a BL in the Gulf of Mexico A similar Argo record was presented by McPhaden et al 2009 i n  t h e  B a y  o f  B e n g a l   B u t   c o m p a re d  t o  A R G O  o r moorings the satellite SSS now enables tracking the spatial variability of SSS induced by hurricanes in an  unprecedented manner  The  hurricane  season  in  the  Atlantic  extends  fromearly June through the end of November with a peak in late August  early September. The most intense hurricanes, according to the National Hurricane Center NHC form off the Cape V erde Islands in the eastern basin in fall growing as they progress westward across the warm SSTs. In 2011, the first of two Cape Verde hurricanes and the second hurricane of the season began as tropical storm Katia in late August Katia reached a Catego ry 1 on September 1 with minimum central pressure of P min  988 mb and the radius of sustained hurricane force winds R  55 km By the afternoon of September 4 Katia rea ched a Category 2 maximum sus tained winds 44 m/s P min 961mb, and R = 75 km\. By t he evening of September 5 after passing over the freshwater plume Katia had strengthened to a Category 4 \(winds >60 m/s, P min 942mb and R = 95 km\. Twenty  four hours later, Katia  weakened to a Category 1. T hey  examine the response of the upper ocean to the passage of Katia as it appears in the in situ and satellite records  About  68  of  hurricanes  that  finally  reached  category 5 have  crossed the Amazon/Orinoco plume Ffield 2007  w h er e t h e presence of BL can enhance their growth rate by 50  Balaguru  et al 2012   T h ey  present a case study of the passage of hurricane Katia over the plume for which an extensive array of remote sensed and in situ observations are available, in particular new SSS from SMOS and Aquarius. A similarly strong haline wake ev ent was detected with SMOS alone following hurricane Igor in Septem ber 2010  The availability of SSS from both SMOS and Aquarius reinforces these first observations and demonstrates spatial and temporal patterns of hurricane BL interactions in an unpreced ented manner They  find that both Igor and Katia forced SSS changes 1 psu over an area exceeding 10 5 km 2 These abrupt changes last and have implications for SSS climate since SSS is not damped like SST  These observations confirm that over the plume a u niform density mixed layer is shallower than uniform temperature layer because of stable halocline, acting to inhibit cooling and vertical mixing Under an intense hurri cane the halocline which is above the thermocline, is mixed first. This produces a SSS  wake that is by a few psu saltier than initial SSS in the plume From space time diagrams of SSS and SST along the hurricane track they  find that haline wake develops only within the plume and is associated with at least 0.5 o C weaker SST cooling than outs ide the plume. This difference in SST cooling is explained by additional work required to mix the BL. Thus BL leads to a reduction in hurricane induced surface cooling that favors hurricane development as the result ing elevated SST and high evap oration en hance the hurricane\325s maximum potential intensity  The geographic location and seasonality of the Amazon/Orinoco plume make hurricane overpasses a not  


 10  infrequent occurrence Indeed the expansion of the plume in August September coincides with the peak of  the production of Cape Verde hurricanes, a group that  includes many of the most intense Category 4 320 5 hurricanes Thus the results presented strongly suggest that the salinity stratification role in mixed layer dynamics should be taken into account when forecasting hurricane growth over the plume The availability of satellite SSS from Aquarius and SMOS along with in situ ARGO measurements is critical to making such model improvements practical  Another notable observation is t he Madden Julian Oscillation  MJO  that  impacts a wide range of weather and climate phenomena. Current global coupled ocean atmospheric general circulation models exhibit considerable shortcomings in representing and predicting the MJO, specifically its initiation due to a lack of i n si tu observations. F or the first time, the MJO propagation can be detect ed from the data from Aquarius. The magnitude and extent of SSS  variations during the MJO is established providing a useful tool for data assimilation into models to correctly repre sent both oceanic and atmospheric processes during intraseasonal variations Salinity observation allows for atmospheric conditions to be inferred from freshwater flux, on which surface salinity is highly dependent Increased observations of global SSS fro m the Aquarius mission will be particularly valuable in remote regions of the tropics and will increase the  dynamical understanding and advance prediction of the MJO through model improvement  On the intraseasonal scale the dominant mode of climate variab ility known as  the MJO  Madden and Julian 1971 affects the tropics through strong air sea coupling Wang and Xie 1998 Fu et al 2003  a n d  i n f l u e n c e s  m a n y  g l o b a l  meteorological phenomena Bond and Vecchi 2003 Matthews 2004 Maloney and Hartmann 200    T he  convective anomalies propagate eastward at an average speed of 5 ms _1 and typically cover 12,000 320 20,000km of the equatorial belt Rui and Wang 1990   T h e m ech an i s m s  t h at  produce the MJO breakdown into two hypotheses 1 The MJO is a response to a  pre existing forcing, and \(2\ the MJO is sustained by its own energy source through coupl ed circulation patterns there fore accurate initial conditions are vitally important for intraseasonal prediction Fu et al 2011  W ith  the increasing availability of satellite and in situ observations the dynamics of the MJO will be better und erstood and the dynamic predic tion will improve  SSS responds to freshwater flux precipitation minus evaporation and wind driven advection making it an ideal variable to ut ilize when understanding the response of the ocean to atmospheric processes during the MJO [Matthews et al 2010 Grunseich et al 2011   P o s i t i v e S S S  an o m al i es  ar e produced during periods of enhanced winds and clear skies positive Outgoing Longwave Rad iation OLR anom  alies which increase evaporation. Enhanced precipitation and cloud cover \(negative OLR anomalies\, combined with a reduction in winds, lead to a reduction in salinity anoma  lies. Additionally advection can produce salinity anomalies  especially in tropical regions of the Indian Ocean where the horizontal salinity gradients are strong  Besides being a variable that responds passively to at mospheric conditions, SSS significantly controls upper ocean density and therefore the Mixed Layer  Depth MLD The formation of a Barrier Layer the layer between the MLD and Isothermal Layer Depth can lead to possible feedbacks that impact the atmospheric component of the MJO as stated as one of the three major hypotheses of the Dynamics of the Mad den Julian Oscillation \(DYNAMO\ field campaign. This layer produces a stable stratification, reducing vertical mixing, which influences surface heat fluxes and thus could possibly impact atmospheric conditions during the MJO Establishing the magnitude and  extent of SSS variations during the MJO will be a useful tool for data a ssimilation into models to cor rectly represent both oceanic thermodynamic characteristics and atmospheric processes during intraseasonal variations  In this study they  show fo r the f irst time the SSS varia tions measured from the Aquarius salinity mission that occur during the MJO and identify the mechanisms that produce the fluctuations Accurate quantification of SSS  during the MJO will lead to the improvement of models data assimil ation dynamical prediction and most importantly MJO initialization  The atmospheric conditions associated with varying phases of the MJO propagation  are responsible for the devel opment of SSS anomalies  This study examines the magni tude and extent of s alinity variations at the surface during the MJO using satellite derived data. Previous studies such as Matthews et al 2010 u t i l i z e  A rg o  o b s e rv a t i o n s  t o  e x p l a i n  h o w  t h e  M J O  modulates salinity Unlike Aquarius which measures salinity directly at the sur face, Argo measurements are taken from 5 to 10 m depth \(10 dbar\. When compared with their  results, SSS anomalies during the development of the convective phase appear to be less pronounced in the Argo data. This is possibly du e to the weak atmospheric for c ing that exists during this phase having little impact on the depth where the observations are taken When the convection is strongest in the Eastern Ind ian Ocean their  results are con sistent in showing the produc tion of negative salinity anom alies but in the western Pacific Ocean Argo data show contrasting negative salinit y anomalies During the produc tion of positive OLR anomalies in the Indian Ocean both studies show positive salinity anomalies, but in the western Pacific Ocean, dissimilar results a ppear These comparisons indicate that salinity variability during the MJO in the Western Pacific Ocean requires additional study in the future  The ability of Aquarius to accurately detect the variations in SSS during different stages of the MJO propagati on shows that it will be a useful tool in understanding MJO dynamics The MJO related SSS  variations have only been shown in model simulations Grunseich et al 2011  a n d  sa t e l l i t e  st u d i e s utilizing additional oceanic parameters to understand the dynamics  are only beginning Grunseich and Subrahmanyam    A na l ys i s  of  S S S  s i m ul a t i ons  f r om  H ybr i d C oor di na t e  Ocean Model output revealed that high resolution ocean

It has now been shown that the measurements gathered from thi s mission will broaden the  understanding in various modes of climate variability even on intraseasonal scales  VI  FUTURE  WORK  This year is expected to yield significant scientific discoveries for satellite salinity measurements A landmark collection of research papers will address early scientific results of the mission and include many aspects of how rainfall, evaporation river outflows and melting ice are linked to salinity ocean current and climate variations  The satellite salinity data are now bei ng tested in numerical ocean mod els that are used for ocean forecasting will soon be used to enhance the skill of long term climate prediction models  The SPURS measurements will conclude in September, and the science teams will focus on data analysis stu dying the relationships between the in situ observations and the satellite salinity data  In the future a second SPURS may be carried out in an area that is dominated by intense annual rainfall in direct contrast to the arid region of the first survey i n order to fully understand ocean processes that regulate the reduced surface salinities and climatic changes in those regions as well  At the end of 2014 Aquarius will complete a baseline three year mission designed to measure the seasonal cycle and inte r annual climate variability Provided that the onboard systems continue to work as needed NASA and CONAE  plan to maintain the mission operations into the future and continue to gather this important new data set for studying ocean dynamics, climate chang e and the global water cycle  VII  SUMMARY  The global map generated from Aquarius data clearly shows the predomin ant and well known climatologi cal ocean salinity features such as higher salinity in the subtropics higher average salinity in the Atlantic Ocean compared to  the Pacific and Indian oceans and lower salinity in rainy belts near the equator in the northe rnmost Pacific Ocean and else where These features are related to large  scale patterns of rainfall and evaporation over the ocean  river outflow and ocean cir culation Th e values depicted in the South ern Ocean retain significant uncertainties associated with high winds and low surface temperatures that complicate the retrieval processing  Other important regional features are clearly evident, inclu ding a contrast between the arid, high salinity Arabian Sea west of the Indian subcontinent and the low salinity Bay of Bengal to the east, which is dominated by the Ganges River and southern Asia monsoon rains The data also reveal important smaller detai ls such as pro minent low salinity water asso ciated with outflow from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers Aquarius will monitor how these various larger  and smaller sc ale fea tures change over time and provide data to study their link to climate and weather var iations  Aquarius  also reveals considerable sur face salinity variation at much smaller scales than expected  In the global maps produced to date the  lower salinity region coincides with the zonal heavy precip itation band in the Intertropi cal Convergence Zone. The current vectors reveal meandering and eddy features associ ated with the salinity patterns. Such detail of surface dynamical structure is not resolved with the conventional salinity observations emphasizing the new capabilities now avail able for studying the ocean and new disco v eries that are in store  Algori thm updates and data reprocess ing will b e frequent and unscheduled dur ing the firs t year.
