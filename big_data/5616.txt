Comparisons with Spatial Autocorrelation and Spatial Association Rule Mining Jiangping Chen 1  Yanan Chen Jie Yu Zhaohui Yang School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering Wuhan University 129 Luoyu Road ,Wuhan ,China 430079 1 chenjp_lisa@163.com Abstract  Spatial autocorrelation is a very general statistical property of economic variables, it indicates correlation of a variable with itself through space. Spatial association rule mining discovery of interesting, meaningful rules in spatial databases ignores autocorrelation of the spatial data, or just generalizes the spatial data into attribute data currently. In order to compare the results between spatial autocorrelation and spatial association rule mining, in th 
is paper, the spatial association rules were mined by Apriori algorithm and itês development algorithm. Then spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial regression analysis were implemented on the same spatial data set. The experimental data is about the county-level revenue and population, education state, health state and social security state in China from 2000 to 2005. The results of the spatial association rules mining proves that economic level such as per capita revenue and social security  have stronger correlation. The result of spatial autocorrelation is that from 2000 to 2005, national county-level per capita revenue, education, health and social security present positive spatial correlation. There is little interannual change in the spatial distribution of per capita revenue, and low economic level applies to almost all counties all over the nation. Education, the situation that low value areas are surrounded by high value areas universally exists, which shows 
that little significant positive influence from high level areas is exerted on low level areas. At th e same time, th e interprovincial education gap is gradually increasing. Health, in the year 2000 to 2005, there is a growing aggregation trend in Chinaês countylevel health spatial pattern, and there a re more low value areas in health. Social security, in the research years, the aggregation trend is gradually decreasing.

 A s the f undam e n tal concept in geography it indicates that nearb y entities often share more similarities than entities far apart In spatial statistics this property is stretched into spatial autocorrelation which is quantified by measures such as Rip ley's K-function and Moran's I[3,4 Po sitiv e s p a tial au to correlatio n i n d icates the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighbouring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board The spatial relationship among locations in a spatial framework is often modelled via a contiguity matrix. A simple contiguity matrix may represent a neighbourhood relationship

Spatial data mining in particular is discovering the interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist im plicitly in spatial data Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatial data sets is more difficult than ex tracting corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types spatial relationships and spatial autocorrelation One major approach in spatial association rule mining is 
firstly generalizing detailed spatial and non-spatial data to a certain high level, and th en studying the general characteristics and data distributions at this level. An attributeoriented induction method has been propose Anot her way is to materialize the relationships into traditional data input columns and then apply classical data mining techniques 12,13,1 However c u rrently most methods just generalize the spatial data into attribute data ignore spatial autocorrelation of the spatial data, which leads poor presence of spatial data of know ledge discovery techniques Developing models or techniques to incorporate spatial information into the spatial data mining process is a new way of mining spatial association It focus on a specific 
Boolean spatial feature specifically the pattern of locations or distributions of the spatial feature s also not fully considers and makes use of the spatial autocorrelation Ignoring the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial data may introduce deviation to the mining results and may lead in loss of information and unreliable results Besides research on the relation between spatial auto correlation and spatial association rule mining may make full use of the inherent property of the spatial data and even provide priori knowledge to the mining procedure In this paper Apriori algo rithm and its developed algorithm are applied to mining the da taset including 
county-level revenue population education state health state and social security state in China from 2000 to 2005 with extracting the association rules After that spatial analysis methods specifically spatial autoco rrelation and spatial regression are employed to the same da taset and the results of spatial analysis are obtained The differences between the results of ___________________________________ 978-14244-83 51-8  1 1 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


Apriori algorithm and spatial auto correlation suggest that the existence of the spatial autocorrelation affects the mining results Finally conclusions are made by comparing of the results of Apriori algorithm a nd spatial analysis Meanwhile the computing time a nd results analysis are discussed II R ELATED DEFINITIONS A spatial association rule is a rule which describes the implication of one or a set of features by another set of features in spatial datab ases. For example, a rule is as follow a house that close to a b each is probably expensive A spatial association rule is a rule in the form 11      mn PPQQsc    Where at least one of the predicates 11    mn PPQQ is a spatial predicate  s is the support of the rule, and  c is the confidence of the rule In a dataset S, the support of a conjunction of predicates 1  m PPP  denoted as  PS  is the number of objects in S which satisfy P versus the total number of objects of S. The confidence of a rule PQ   denoted as  PQS   is the possibility th at Q is satisfied by a member of S when P is satisfied by the same member of S Following the above definitio n, a large number of spatial association rules can be deri ved from a large spatial database However most people will be only interested in the patterns which occur relatively frequently\(with large supports\ the rules which have strong imp lications\(with high confidence The rules with large supports and high confidence are strong rules[14 III T HOUGHTS OF EXPERIMENT Mostly researchers are using a popular data mining approach-Apriori in association rule mining Given a set of itemsets for instance, sets of retail transactions, each listing individual items purchased the Apriori algorithm attempts to mine the possibility of simultan eous occurrence of items, and then build relationships among them in databases. The algorithm can be divided in to two parts: find all frequent itemsets, and generate reliable association rules straightforward from all frequent itemsets As mentioned above conventional association rule mining like Apriori algorithm ignores autocorrelation of the spatial data or just generalizes the spatial data into attribute data in other words it works based on hypothesis that all data are independent and concern s mainly on the attribute data neglects the spatial information of the data. But in spatial association rule mining spatial autocorrelation of univariate can not be ignored a s a strong spatial autocorrelation indicates a strong spatial aggreg ation which means that the variableês high frequency in the spatial database Besides, study on the sp atial correlation between two variables may help to find out which variable has stronger relationship with the variable we interested in. In spatial association rule mining vari ables with stro nger relationship forms a rule which will be co nsidered as a single spatial association rule Furthermore as spatial regression can capture spatial dependency in regression an alysis, avoiding statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, as well as pr oviding information on spatial relationships among the va riables involved it is used to studying the spatial association between three or more variables to find sp atial association rules in this paper Relation between per capita revenue and other variables can be obtained by the Apriori algorithm which mainly focus on the non-spatial part of the data Followed by the spatial analysis methods on the same da ta set which not only takes the non-spatial part into consid eration but also thinks over the spatial part of the data using th e spatial tool measuring the adjacency known as spatial weight matrix By comparing with the results of Apriori algorithm the paper seeks to explore the relationship between spatial autocorrelation and spatial association rule mining on one hand to find how the spatial autocorrelation brings deviation to the mining result according to the difference of the results on the other hand to find how to guide the mining procedure using spatial autocorrelation acco rding to the similarity of the results The experiment co nsists of two parts Implement the spatial associati on rules in the data set with Apriori algorithm which also co nsists of two parts using the classic Apriori algorithm and using the improved Apriori algorithm for mining[17 lo re th e sa m e d a taset usin g spatial autocorrelation method and spatial regression method then make conclusions by comparing with the results of Apriori algorithm IV E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS A Experimental data The experimental data consists of statistical data of countylevel revenue, population education health and social security state in China fro m 2000 to 2005 T he data is showed in Fig. 1.

In other words the mining results of Apriori algorithm are basically consistent with the results of sp atial autocorrelation and spatial regression that is spa tial analysis However the advantage of the spatial analysis is efficiency as spatial data is already known to be large in size It can save time consumption significantly In addition spatial analysis method will find much more in teresting and useful rules and knowledge from the spatial d ata such as the distribution of the variables the cluster ce nters of the variables even the changing trend of the variables VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK A Conclusion In this paper two methods are applied to mining association rules including the Apriori algorithm and spatial analysis method\(spatial auto correlation and spatial regression to extract the co rrelation between the county-level revenue and population education state health state and social security state in China from 2 000 to 2005 Results of the two methods are compared in order to find which one is more appropriate under certain circumstance Log transformation is applied to the experiment data which is effective in normalising the data in addition to weakening the negative effect of outliers A strong correlation of the variables is observed, revealing that there are clear spatial patterns of the variables on the distribution map Mining spatial association rules present a great challenge to the developers of multi-relational data mining methods as the explosive growth of spatial data and widespread use of spatial databases emphasize the need for the automated discovery of spatial knowledge In this paper we explore the spatial association rule mining which take account of the spatial autocorrelation of the data. Illustrative examples taken from spatial data of county-level revenue and popu lation education state, health state and social security state in China show that our method enables us to use GeoDa to compute the spatial autocorrelation between the variables and locations. It will be very time consuming if there are a lot of counties to mine the spatial association rules with Ap riori algorithm Moreover implicit spatial patterns will be extracted from the analysis results of spatial auto correlation The most important thing is spatial analysis method will provides priori knowledge to the mining procedure as the results of both methods have so many rules in common However the differences between the two methods showed that the spatial autocorrelation will also brings deviation to the results which we must find ways to eliminate B Future work Besides the deviation that spatial autocorrelation brings to the mining results itês very difficult to set the rules to specify the candidate frequ ent itemsets from the spatial autocorrelation In this paper, we get the candidate frequent itemsets by the level of correlation between the variables and the goodness of fit of the models and donêt know how the spatial autocorrelation affect the mining procedure So how to maintain the impact on mining procedure that is when to make use of the spatial autocorrelati on and when to eliminate it should be impro ved in the future A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yout h Science Fund Project\(No 40801152 and Scho larship Research Fund Pr oject Ministry of Education\(No.213153249 R EFERENCES  Tobler W A com pute r m ovie si mulating urban growth in the Detroit  region Economic Geography  vol 46, pp. 234-240 Feb. 1970  Clark, Philip Evans, "Distance to nearest neighbor as a m easure of  spatial relationships in populations Ecology \(Ecological Society of America  vol. 35 pp. 445Ö453.

Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or Sensor Data Estiamtion In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique for post mining of non-redundant association rules for sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed based on non-redundant informative association rules which means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules contain the input itemset. There are some research works that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18 Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce the number of rules to the minimum In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all items in X2/Xinput. Index\(z z and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2 Support\(Xl=>X2 C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the current round of readings of stream data and their corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified confidence The algorithm is described as below. The input of the procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence 


In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected The confidence of the select association rules are calculated in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7 filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does not contain new estimated items. Each new item was processed in line 8 and 9 so that missing sensor values are V5-104 2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC modified and updated.

Figure 1. The post mining of non-redundant association rule for sensor data estimation IV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY The performance of our proposed approach is studied by means of simulation. Several different simulation experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed technique and compare it with the Average Window Size A WS linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running time and memory space usage when applying different methods to the application dataset The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data represents the current location, the time interval, and the number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor nodes report to a single server.

see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation accuracy From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique gives the best average estimation result of the above approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM approach. The linear interpolation, A WS, and linear trend approaches perform no better than WARM and the proposed approaches. From Figure 2, we can also see that the proposed technique gives the best estimation result on the maximum estimation accuracy, which is the root square error for the maximum difference between the estimated and accurate values 0.6 0.5 0.4 w n 0.3 cz 0.2  Average 0.1  Maximum 0 l' ?? 0" </.,oQ Figure 2.

Performance Study of Memory Usage Figure 4 illustrates the memory usage of A WS, linear interpolation, linear trend, WARM and proposed approaches in MB. The experimental results show that in terms of memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all the other four approaches. The results of the simulation experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory space using WARM is much higher than that using proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data structure uses less memory space than the cube data structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets information Figure 4. Performance study of memory usage for traffic monitoring application in MB V. CONCLUSTIONS Sensor stream applications are becoming very common with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant association rules, and used the result to produce missing data estimation in sensor network applications. The objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non redundant association rule mining based on the users request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study 


shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area worth to explore REFERENCES 1] Agrawal, R., & Imielinski, T., & Swami, A., "Mining association rules between sets of items in massive databases", International Conference on Management of Data, 1993 2] Austin, F.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
