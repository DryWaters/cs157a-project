Proceehgs of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 AN EFFICIENT MININGALGORITHM FOR FREQUENT PATTERN IN INTRUSION DETECTION QING-HUA LI JIA-JUN XTONG HUA-BING YANG College of Computer, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074,China Department of Computer AFRA Wuhan 4300 19,China E-MAIL jiajunxiong@yahoo.com.cn Abstract In data mining-based intrusion detection system we should make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion 
detection in order to efficiently extract relative rules from large amounts of audit records This paper first gives a summary of the basic association rule algorithm and episode rule algorithm then improves the basic algorithm considering the characteristic of audit records Key words Data mining Intrusion detection Frequent pattern Association rule Episode rule With the development of the computer security the security system progressed from static model to dynamic model Intrusion detection is an active protection technology which can defend insider attacks outsider attacks and the misuses of users in 
real time Intrusion detection can research into intrusion accidents intrusion measures and defects of the attack aim to construct an efficient system ,which can detect the intrusion and respond before the intrusion take effect After decades of development, intrusion detection system can make use of some efficient technology including nerve network data mining etc The data mining-based intrusion detection system analyses the data of network trafic and system log and extracts intrusion modes and normal modes to detect intrusion Nowadays the main mining algorithms for association rules implement a method named level-wise approximate mining that extracts frequent itemsets from the transactional database. However, the spending for scanning 
the transactional database twice is so lavish that the efficiency of the algorithm debases. This paper presents an extended algorithm that can make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion detection to lessen the amount of the candidate itemsets So the efficiency of algorithm improves greatly 1 The basic algorithm In order to construct an accurate classifier it is necessary to gather a sufficient amount of training data and identify a set of meaningful features Both of these tasks need to extract the feature of 
audit records Mining audit records is to extract frequent patterns namely association rules and frequent episodes from audit records 1.1 The basic algorithm for association rules In the database the association between data items means that we can infer that particular data item is in existence because of the appearance of some data items in a transaction The purpose of mining association rules is to dig out all the latent association rules between the data items The main object of mining association rules is the transactional database We provide the terms in relation to 
association rules with the standardization definition As follows Definition 1.1 Let A be a set of attributes and I be a set of values on A called items Any subset of I is called an itemset Definition 1.2 Let I be an itemset and i be an item on I Any set of ial is call a transaction\(T Every transaction 
has a unique sign namely TID Definition 1.3 Let D be a set of transaction\(T D is called a transactional database Definition 1.4 If TCI XCI TCX then we assume transaction\(T\supports itemset\(X In other words T can meet X Definition 1.5 Define support\(X as the percentage of transactions\(records in D that contains itemset X Definition 1.6 Here 
X C_ I Y I and X n Y   define implication formula X 3 Y as production rule based on the transactional database\(D Definition 1.7 Given supp\(X U Y we assume the support of rule X 3 Y in D\(transactiona1 database is S Here is the expression supp\(X 3 Y 0-7803-7865-2/031$17.00 02003 IEEE 138 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 Definition 1.8 If C of D\(transactiona1 database can support both X and Y we assume the confidence of rule X j Y is C in D Here is the expression conf\(X Y Definition 1.9 Let X 3 Y be the rule in D and supp\(X U Y conf\(X Y Here is the expression of an association rule X 3 y s c In order to identify meaningful association rules we introduce minimum support and minimum confidence The first limen is the minimum support that meets users\222 request And the second is the minimum confidence that meets users\222 request Definition 1.10 The number of items in itemset X is k Define k as the length of X Definitionl.11 We call itemset L a frequent itemset if support 2 minimum-support The purpose of mining association rules is to dig out the frequent association rules whose confidence and support is not less than the scheduled limen from transactional database D We can solve the mining problem in two steps 1 Dig out all the frequent itemsets from transactional database D 2 Compute the requisite frequent association rules from frequent itemsets We must discover all the subsets of frequency itemset A Note that subset a 4  If supp\(A a 2 minimum-confidence then we find association rule a 2 A-a Here supp\(A a is the confidence of rule a3 A-a In fact the first step is the most difficult in the mining process After discovering all the frequent itemsets it is easy to compute the relative association rules Many mining algorithm are advanced to solve the first step Algorithm Apriori is the most effective among these mining algorithms. The mining algorithms are based on the theory that any subset of a frequent itemsets also be a frequent itemset The algorithm starts with finding the frequent itemsets of length 1 then iteratively computes frequent itemsets of length k  1 from those of length k This process terminates when there are no new frequent itemsets generated It then proceeds to compute rules that satisfy the minimum confidence requirement The data structure for a frequent itemset has a row ail vector that records the transactions in which the itemset is contained When a length k candidate itemset Ck is generated by joining two length k 1 frequent itemsets E 1 2 k-I and lk-l  the row vector of ck is simply the bitwise AND product of the row vectors of I k-l and 1  Function apriori_gen\(Zk performs to compute ck  The support of Ck can be calculated easily by counting the IS in I its row vector, instead of scanning the database. There is also no need to perform the prune step in the candidate generation function. Since most @re-processed\audit data files are small enough this implementation works well in our application domain Function aprioriAen\(1 k  is composed connection part and prune part First it generates candidate itemset Ck the program code is shown below Insert into Ck select P.iteml P.item2;.....P.itemk.1 q.itemk.l 1 I 2 from 1 k-1 p 1k-I 4 of the where P.iteml q.itemk.l e P.itemk.z q.itemk.2 P.itemk I q.itemk I Then delete all the items that contains one of length k-1 frequent itemsets from the candidate itemset Ckon the basis of the theory that any subset of a frequent itemsets also be a frequent itemset 1.2 Mining episode rules Episode is a set of sequential transactions in a given period The support of frequent episode is not less than minimum-support The problem of finding frequent episodes based on minimal occurrences was introduced in Reference 6 Briefly given an event database D where each transaction is associated with a timestamp an interval tl t2 is the sequence of transactions that starts from timestamp tl and ends at t2 The width of the interval is defined as t2-tl Given an itemset A in D an interval is a minimal occur-rence of A if it contains A and none of its proper sub-intervals contains A Define support\(X as the ratio between the number of minimum occurrences that contain itemset X and the number of records in D A frequent episode rule is the expression X Y 3 Z confidence, support window Here X Y and Z are itemsets in D Support\(X U Y U Z is the support of the rule and support\(X U Y U Z XUY is the confidence, window is the internal The width of each of the occurrences must be less than window A serial episode rule has the additional constraint that X Y and Z must occur in transactions in partial time order  i.e 2 follows Y and Y follows X This rule expresses sequential patterns between audit records In an internal\(window after the occurrence of X and Y we assume that the probability of occurrence of Z is C and the probability of occurrence of this sequential patterns is S When minimum-confidence  minimum-support and window are known algorithm for episode rules can compute all frequent episode rules Our implementation of the frequent episode algorithm 139 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 service telnet ftp utilized the data structures and library functions of the association rule algorithm Here any subset of a frequent itemset must also be a frequent itemset since each interval that contains the itemset as well as contains all of its subsets We can therefore also start with finding the frequent episodes of length 2,then length 3 etc. Instead of finding correlations across attributes we are looking for correlations across records The row vector is now used as the intemal vector where each pair of adjacent is the pair of boundaries of an interval A temporal join function that considers minimal and non-overlapping occurrences is applied to create the interval vector of a candidate length k itemset from the two interval vectors of two length k 1 frequent itemsets src-host dst-host src-bytes dst-bytes flag A B 100 2000 SF C B 200 300 SF 2 Improvement on the basic algorithm smtp IB DHP\(direct hashing and pruning is an extended algorithm of Aprion It is the most efficient among all unparallel algorithms All the algorithms implement a method named level-wise approximate mining that extracts frequent items through scanning the transactional database repeatedly However the spending for scanning the database twice is so lavish that the efficiency of the algorithm debases. Therefore we take the interestingness into account and improve on the basic algorithm Using the minimum support and confidence values to output only the \223statistically significant\224 patterns, the basic D 250 300 SF I algorithms implicitly measure the interestingness i.e relevancy of patterns by their support and confidence values without regard to any available prior domain knowledge. That is assume Z is the interestingness measure of a pattem p then I f\(support confidence where f is some ranking function We propose here to incorporate schema-level information into the interestingness measures Assume ZA is a measure on whether a pattern p contains the specified important i.e 223interesting\224 attributes our extended interestingness measure is le  fe\(IA\(p f\(support\(p\confidence fe\(IA I where fe is a ranking function that first considers the attributes in the pattem then the support and confidence values For efficiency, we use interestingness lA as item constraints i.e conditions dying candidate itemset generation So we can generate rules in relation to intrusion detection telnet A 2.1 Using axis attributes D 200 12100 SF There is a partial 223order of importance\224 among the attributes of an audit record Some attributes are essential in describing the data while others only provide auxiliary information Consider the audit data of network connections shown in Table 1 smtp IB Table 1 C 200 300 SF timestamp http ID 1.1 A I 200 0 REJ 2.0 2.3 3.4 3.7 5.2 Here each record row describes a network connection A network connection can be uniquely identified by  timestamp,src host src port dst host sewice that is the combination of its start time, source host source port destination host and service destination port These are the essential attributes when describing network data We argue that the 223relevant\224 association rules should describe patternsrelated to the essential attributes Patterns that include only the unessential attributes are normally \223irrelevant\224. For example, the basic association rules algorithm may generate rules such as src bytes  200  Jug  SF 0.6 0.21 These rules are not useful and to some degree are misleading There is no intuition for the association between the number of bytes from the source src bytes and the normal status flag  SF of the connection We call the essential attribute axis attribute when they are used as a form of item constraint in the association rules algorithm. During candidate generation an item set must contain value\(s of the axis attribute We consider the correlations among non-axis attributes as not interesting In other words 1 if p contains axis attributes 0 Otherwise 140 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 In practice we need not designate all essential attributes as the axis attributes For example some network analysis tasks require statistics about various network services while others may require the patterns related to the hosts. We can use service as the axis attribute to compute the association rules that describe the patterns related to the services of the connections It is even more important to use the axis attribute to constrain the item generation for frequent episodes. The basic algorithm can generate serial episode rules that contain only the 223unimportant\224 attribute values For example src bytes  200 src bytes  200 3 dst bytes  300 src bytes  200 0.4 0.2 2s Note that here each attribute value  e.g src bytes  200 is from a different connection record. To make matter worse if the support of an association rule on non-axis attributes A 3 B is high then there will be a large number of 223useless\224 serial episode rules 2.2 Using reference attributes Another interesting characteristic of system audit data is that some attributes can be references of other attributes These reference attributes normally cany information about some 223subject\224 and other attributes describe the 223actions\224 that refer to the same 223subject\224 Consider the log of visits to a Web site as shown in Table 2 Table 2 Here action and request are the \223actions\224 taken by the 223subject\224 remote host We see that for a number of remote hosts each of them makes the same sequence of requests 223/images\224 223/images\224 and 223/shuttle/missions/sts-71\224 It is important to use the 223subject\224 as a reference when finding such frequent sequential 223action\224 patterns because the 223actions\224 from different 223subjects\224 are normally irrelevant This kind of sequential patterns can be represented as subject  X action  a subject  X action  b 3 subject  x action  c c s w Note that within each occurrence of the pattern the action values refer to the same subject yet the actual subject value may not be given in the rule since any particular subject value may not be frequent with regard to the entire dataset In other words subject is simply a reference or a variable To avoid having a huge amount of 221\221useless\222\222 episode rules, we extended the basic frequent episodes algorithm to compute frequent sequential patterns in two phases 1 It finds the frequent associations using the axis attribute 2 It generates the frequent serial patterns from these associations That is for the first phase find all unique attribute values in the database  for the second phase when forming an episode an additional condition is that within its minimal occurrences,\221 the records covered by its constituent itemsets have the same value\(s In other words 1 if the itemsets ofp refer to the same axis attribute 0 otherwise ZA  We get an episode rule as follows service=smtp,src-bytes=2OO,dst-bytes=30O,flag=SF service=telnet,flag=SF service=http,src~bytes=200  We in effect have combined the associations among attributes and the sequential patterns among the records into a single rule This rule formalism not only eliminates irrelevant patterns it also provides rich and useful information about the audit data 3 Analysis We adjust the basic algorithm on the basis of discussed above. The main part of the algorithm keeps changeless. Function apriorisen is modified  The program code is shown below 141

transform imposed by a divergent-convergent axon projection The selection of the basin of attraction is done by the stimulus given to the receptors feeding the primary receiving cortex The basins and their attractors are shaped by Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning as well as by reafferent barrages [Kay et al 1996 Kay and Freeman 19981 that bias and tilt the attractor landscape The trajectory manifested in the EEG is higher in dimension than the landscape so that every basin is immediately accessible from every point of the trajectory with minimal need for search Capture by one of the attractors reduces the dimension of activity below that of the landscape 6 Conclusions We are clearly still a long way from full understanding of intentionality in animals and even farther from constructing analog systems that will embody the principles of active perception by which brains achieve their ascendency The main inference that I wish to propose from these biological studies is that there is nothing mysterious or inaccessible about intentional behavior and that given the right insights into how simpler brains organize themselves in the necessary construction and pursuit of their own goals, there is no insuperable barrier to building devices that have those capacities There is already substantial progress in that direction through the development of embodied robots Clark 1996 Hendriks-Jansen 1996 Brooks 19991 It is not too soon to begin to consider the ethical issues that success in these projects will surely raise Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and from the Office of Naval Research References Aquinas St. Thomas \(1272\The Summa Theologica Volume 19 in the Great Books Series Chicago:Encyclopedia Britannica Inc 1952 Barrie JM Freeman WJ Lenhart M 1996 Modulation by discriminative training of spatial patterns of gamma EEG amplitude and phase in neocortex of rabbits Journal of Neurophysiology Brooks R.A 1999 Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI Cambridge MA MIT Press Clark A 1996\Being There.

dictive model for representing user behaviors and a useful mechanism for identifying and interpreting user behavior patterns for the Web data 7 Conclusions and Future Work We described a mixture model based approach to generating and visualizing individual behavior models for CiteSeer users We represented the Web data as a collection of ordered action sequences for each user We introduced a maximum entropy based approach for modeling the user behavior motivated by its ability to model long term dependencies in data sequences In addition to maxent model we also investigated the use of 336rst order Markov mixture models We demonstrated that both methods are able to generate strong predictive models with different strengths and weaknesses Markov model performed better for predicting the behavior of the known users whereas maximum entropy model was better at modeling the global behavior model and therefore the unknown users also We used a simple method to achieve personalization yet managed to avoid the insuf\336cient data problem of traditional personalization techniques By using mixture model based clustering we were able to identify and visualize speci\336c behavior patterns of CiteSeer users where it s demonstrated that maximum entropy model\325s computational cost pays off t recognizing complex dominant patterns of user behavior We plan to expand our work on identifying speci\336c user behavior patterns and provide customized services for instance customized recommendations for each of the behavior model groups We are also interested in naming these groups of users We intend to perform real-time experiments on CiteSeer with our maximum entropy based predictive model We are also planning to apply our personalization algorithm to mixtures of hidden Markov models and compare it with the maxent model proposed in this paper 8 Acknowledgements This work has been partially supported by a grant from Lockheed Martin We would like to thank Steve Lawrence for making

All requirements of this section apply in the vicinity of uninsulated but covered wires e.g weatherproof wires Requires employees to treat ungrounded metal parts of equipment transformer cases and breaker housing as energized unless known by test to be free from voltage Comments I APPA comments that it is impossible to enforce paragraph l\(3 which addresses the working position Situations arise where it is impossible to prevent contact APPA recommends that l\(3 be reworded to add where practicable and comments that work should generally be done from below rather than above energized parts APPA also recommends inclusion of reference to Tables 422-2 and 427-2 from the 1987 NESC which allows reduced clearances if switching surges are known The comparable tables in the current 1993 NESC are 441-3 and 441-4 EEI has expressed particular concern about the Clearance Section 1 with reference to maintenance of transmission facilities EEI has attached an extensive proposed revision to this section which includes clearance tables which are different than the ones included in the proposed Rules Their tables also include reduced clearances for situations where known transient overvoltage factors are present for transmission voltages 121 kV and greater Their attachment also includes calculations and backup material from which their proposed tables were derived This proposed attachment is in the form of a working agreement of EEI/lBEW Portions of the attachments which do not agree with IBEWs recommendations are indicated In a departure from the proposed Rules and the current 1993 NESC EEI proposes that facilities 300 volts and less not require the use of insulated equipment rubber gloves IBEW was not in concurrence with this proposal at the time it was submitted  1 Deenergizing Lines and Equipment for Emvlovee Protection m This section is analogous to section d which is included for power generation plants It applies to the deenergization of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees Included is a detailed procedure for deenergizing facilities if an employee must depend on others to operate switching to deenergize lines on which the employee is to work including transfer of responsibility, tagging and grounding Comments ml Both EEI and APPA recommend that this section be revised to cover only systems 600 volts and greater Additionally APPA and EEI comment that lockout procedures which are included in this section and the preceding section d should have a provision that the utility may use its own procedures if developed documented and implemented prior to the promulgation of these regulations EEI proposes a fairly extensive revision to Section m\which includes the following major changes from the OSHA version Places greater emphasis on the system operator in the lockout/tagout procedures Provides for record keeping of the operations by the system operator Places reduced emphasis on the original person requesting the clearance on the applicable lines Groriiidina for the Protection of Emvlovees n This section includes requirements for the protective grounding of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees For employees to work on lines which are treated as deenergized these lines must be deenergized A2-9 


according to section m and grounded Under certain unusual conditions the facilities need not to be grounded in accordance with these requirements There must be 1 no possibility of contact with another energized source and 2 no hazard of induced voltage This section Requires temporary protective grounds at each work location or on either side of the location if one location is not feasible Requires grounding equipment to have proper ampacity No 2 AWG copper minimum and low enough impedance to permit operation of protective devices in case of accidental energization Requires testing before grounding to determine absence of voltage Requires the ground end of the protective ground to be connected first, then the line end, using an insulated device Requires removal first from the line end using an insulated device Prohibits grounding cables at a remote location if a hazardous transfer of potential could occur under fault conditions Allows grounds to be temporarily removed for tests but requires previously grounded line to be considered energized during to test Comments n APPA comments that this section on grounding should apply to systems greater than 600 volts only Additionally both EEI and APPA submitted similar comments regarding flexibility which should be included to allow either single or dual point grounding or a combination of the two methods to allow employers to choose the method best for the particular situation APPA recommends that grounding should be allowed on lines where nominal voltage is not found In many cases facilities may be grounded when induced or static voltages are present APPA also comments that removal of grounds for cables being tested with low voltage should not require treatment of these cables as energized EEI believes that OSHA's requirement to require work location grounding where feasible is not workable, objecting to the word feasible as all encompassing Testing and Test Facilities 0 This section covers the proposed safe work practices for high-voltage and high-power testing performed in laboratories in shops and in substations under the exclusive control of an electric utility It does not cover routine functions for metering, relaying and normal line work Requirements addressed include the following Guarding of test areas  walls fences and barriers Grounding practices  similar to grounding requirements of other sections but requires isolated ground-return conductor system for high current testing Control and measuring circuits Safety check of test areas at beginning of each group of continuous tests Comments 0 APPA provided the following comments on this section Recommends clarification of the wording so that there is a clear distinction between this specialized testing and routine operations such as phasing and low voltage testing Recommends deletion of the requirement for an isolated ground return during high current testing citing that staged fault tests often involve large areas which would not allow this requirement to be met  asks that A2-10

is that this requirement is sufficiently performance oriented to meet the requirements for old installations according to the 1987 NEW Requires draw-out circuit breakers to be inserted and removed while in the open position and that if the design permits the control circuits be rendered inoperative while breakers are being inserted and removed stated in the Rules and requests that existing installations not be required to be modified to meet NESC APPA recommends that Section u 4 i which includes requirements for enclosing electric conductors and equipment to minimize unauthorized access to such equipment be modified to refer to only those areas which are accessible to the public Requires conductive fences around substations to be grounded Power Generation v Addresses guarding of energized parts  Fences screens, partitions or walls This section provides additional requirements and related work practices for power generating plants  Entrances locked or attended Special Conditions w  Warning signs posted  Live parts greater than 150 volts to be guarded or isolated by location or be insulated  Enclosures are to be according to the 1987 NESC Sections llOA and 124A1 and in 1993 NESC  Requires guarding of live parts except during an operation and maintenance function when guards are removed barriers must be installed to prevent employees in the area from contacting exposed live parts Requires employees who do not work regularly at the substation to report their presence Requires information to be communicated to employees during job briefings in accordance with Section \(c of the Rules Comments U APPA and EEI provide comments as follows Both believe that some older substations \(and power plants would not meet NESC as This paragraph proposes special conditions that are encountered during electric power generation, transmission and distribution work including the following Capacitors  Requires individual units in a rack to be short circuited and the rack grounded  Require lines with capacitors connected to be short circuited before being considered deenergized Current transformer secondaries may not be opened while energized and must be bridged if the CT circuit is opened Series street lighting circuits with open circuit voltages greater than 600 volts must be worked in accordance with Section q\or t and the series loop may be opened only after the source transformer is deenergized and isolated or after the loop is bridged to avoid open circuit condition Sufficient artificial light must be provided where insufficient naturals illumination is present to enable employee to work safely A2-17 


US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
