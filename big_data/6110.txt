There are different examples such as transport, health-care 
industry or education. This work covers just the field of education or university\264s environment. Purpose of this work is to identify Big Data sources from university\264s environment and also design of procedure how to work with them. Paper also shows possible using concept of Big Data but does not show what types of analyses should be performed to improve education process. It means that the main benefit of this work is design of architecture for this problem from the technical perspective. In addition, there are some specific software applications that can be deployed to solve this problem I  I 
NTRODUCTION   The area of data analysis is still evolving the last period The reason for this fact is very simple \226 the amount of data is growing incredibly fast and it is still necessary to find new technologies that could work with this situation Information obtained from this huge mass can be very important for concerned entities. On the other hand, there is still risk, that after complicated processes, information value will be still zero [1  T h e am o u n t  o f  d a t a is n o t th e only one problem in recent years. Currently, there is a lot of new data formats and what is worse, a lot of data is even in the unstructured forms \(images, audio, tweets, text messages, server logs, and so on\ Moreover, the 
processing time between the requirement to process this data and the processing itself is very important. This aspect is called \226 velocity Together with the volume and variety we have three basic aspects of concept called Big Data [2   This topic is currently absolutely dominant in the field of IT Technologies. Potential of these analyses can be huge, not only for business but also for areas such as health, transport and education or all together in the smart city projects [3  4    Th e a r ea  of  edu c ati o n is a k ey f act or  to the success of every society and therefore it is important to think about how to improve. Is it possible to use the concept of BIG DATA for the acquisition of new 
knowledge that will improve processes in education? Yes definitely. Currently, there are several case studies and works, confirming the fact that this idea is not quite crazy As an example could be the data analysis of 860,000 students in Colorado in 2000 high schools and 178 districts. The outcome of these analyses should be student\222s readiness for college or career  6   T h er e ar e also other studies about tracking student progre  8  and monitoring of behavioural patterns of students in learning [9 A ll the s e w o r k s a l r e a d y d e sc ribe r e sul t s fro m analysis of Big Data contrast to this paper. This is about technical architecture for solving this problem. Actually this is a guide what must be done before a start of analysis 
in environment of education system or university II  WHAT IS BIG DATA  A  Definition First, Big Data does not have only single definition Company SAS defines Big Data as follows 223Big data is a popular term used to describe the exponential growth availability and use of information, both structured and unstructured\224   In contrast, IBM defines Big Data as follows: \223 Data coming from everywhere; sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction record, and cell phone 
GPS signal to name a few\224   B  Dimensions of Big Data As mentioned, concept of Big Data has three basic dimensions 
200  Volume Data volumes are doubling every year. Reasons are simple. Significant percentage of organizations is storing historic data for many years. Social media provide a huge amount of text data \(Facebook has more than 901 million active users generating social interaction data\ RFID systems generate up to 1,000 times the data of conventional bar code systems 200  Variety Data today comes in all types of formats - from a standard productions 
systems or transaction databases to OLAP Online Analytical Processing\ cubes. There are emails, stock or financial data and huge percentage of non-numerical data 
200  Velocity It means how fast data is being produced and how fast the data must be processed to meet requirements or demands  11 12 13   200  Companies, working with Big Data also talk about several other dimensions SAMI 2014 Ä IEEE 12th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelli\gence and Informatics Ä January 23-25, 2014.

200  Complexity Big Data is from multiple sources. It is necessary to connect and find relations. Data should be controlled in order to achieve systematically integration structured and unstructured data 11 12   C  Technology Processing of Big Data by traditional methods is too complicated, time-consuming and not least financially unattractive. Therefore, there is a demand for new solutions. Currently, the focus is on parallel computing 226 a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously. Principle is that large problems should be divided into smaller pieces, which are then solved in parallel There are several important frameworks in Big Data area 200  MapReduce One of the most used frameworks using for processing parallelizable problems across big datasets working with a large number of computers \(nodes\.  A MapReduce can work raw data stored in disk files, in relation databases or both. The data can be in structured or unstructured forms \(weblog records, e-commerce click trails, binary or multi-line records\. This algorithm composes from two procedures Map  procedure performs filtering and sorting \(for example \226 sorting students by last name into queues \226 one queue for each surname Reduce  procedure performs a summary operation \(for example - counting the number of students in each queue, yielding surname frequencies MapReduce libraries have been written in many programming languages, but there are different levels of optimization. One of the most popular implementation is open-source Apache Hadoop 200  Hadoop It is an open source software project that enables distributed \(parallel\ processing of large amount of data sets across clusters of many computers. One server can scale up to thousands of machines, with a very high fault tolerance Hadoop derives from Google\264s MapReduce and Google File System papers. This framework is written in Java 200  HDFS The most common MapReduce usage pattern \226 Hadoop Distributed File System. HDFS is a distributed, scalable and portable file-system for the Hadoop framework written in Java too HDFS stores large files \(from gigabytes to terabytes\ across a large amount of servers 200  Apache Hive It is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. This warehouse provides summarization of data, query and analysis. Hive supports analysis of big datasets stored in HDFS, Amazon S3 file system etc. It provides an SQL \226like language called HiveQL, supporting indexes 200  NoSQL Database system providing a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data with less constrained than traditional SQL \(relational databases. Impact of these databases is still higher, especially in Big Data concept [14    Although an increase big data technology is huge, it doesn\264t mean the end of classical BI tools like Cognos QlikView, SPSS and so on. Trend is that BI tools should be work with new Big Data technologies side by side Here is a list of some applications, working with traditional data and Big Data 200  Apache Hadoop 200  IBM InfoSphere BigInsights 200  Cloudera 200  IBM Cognos 200  IBM SPSS 200  SAS 200  Quest  III  CONCEPT  DEFINITION  The concept definition consists of three main parts 1  Identification of Big Data at university 2  Design of algorithm for processing of Big Data 3  Design of technical architecture A  Identification of Big Data sources The starting point is the identification of Big Data and determine the sources from which the come. We assume that we are dealing with Technical University of Ko\232ice environment, but it can be very similar at any other universities. Bigger differences begin to emerge at the level of elementary and high schools. We divided this data to the groups based on its sources \(Figure 1 200  documents in non-electronic form 200  data from information systems 200  logs from university servers 200  opinions from social networks 200  data from public education portals  The first data source is a little bit specific and due to fact that these records are not in electronic form. It is questionable its usability in this form. If not, is it useful to transform it? We talk about historical writings, reports on exams, and records of students, whether actual written exams The second source of data is data from information systems available to universities. This is probably the least problematic source of data because of its format. This data is in structured form in tables. We mean primarily information about students, courses, exam\264s marks. All this information is available in Modular Academic Information System \(MAIS Very popular topic is currently analysis of server\264s log There are a lot of server\264s log at the university level Students are connected on web through university Wi-Fi P. Michalik et al. Ä Concept Definition for Big Data Architecture in the\ Education System 332 200  Veracity IBM Company argues, that 1 in 3 business leaders don\264t trust the information they use to make decision. How can we work with data that we do not believe 


 Figure 1. Big Data sources at university Figure 2. Algorithm of processing big data zones and networks. It is interesting to watch activity of every student in his free time. This information should be very helpful for creating a report about student\264s hobby. If you know student\264s hobby, you know which university course is interesting for him. If you have this report for 2 000 students, you know which university courses are not favourite Next one source is the most popular thing on the web at present. We talk about social networks \226 the big phenomenon of our times. Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have a big potential to bring still new data from students, lectors, politicians from education zone etc Can you imagine situation that you know everything about all student\264s opinion about his study? On the other hand extraction of knowledge from this source is the most problematic. There are several reasons such as privacy data is high unstructured, the amount of data is huge, too Last one, but not least is information from public portals, supporting education system. For example \226 portalvs.sk  in Slovakia, official websites of Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic \226 www. minedu.sk and other public portals and discussion forums   B  Design of algorithm After the identification of a data sources we can start work with them. There is an algorithm for data processing in the picture below \(Figure 2 First step is obtaining data. As mentioned, it is highly dependent from data source. In case of internal data source like academic information system, problem is very easy. On the other hand, access to the data from social network is not simple task Next step of algorithm divides data to 2 groups. Data which is in structured format are sent directly to relation database management systems \(RDBMS    This group includes data from MAIS in case of Technical University of Ko\232ice. Second group consists of server logs, tweets and other unstructured data. This group of data has to be sent to the Apache Hadoop for processing by MapReduce for example. Then, we can use Apache Hive to transform this data. Transformed data can be sent to RDBMS Now we have a RDBMS system with all data. It means, that we can create a data warehouse using by one of the classical way create it. As example should be star schema in data warehouse If you have a data warehouse, you can start to do OLAP operations and to create different types of reports and analysis. Of course, there is also option of data mining applications  C  Design of architecture Design of architecture is closely related to algorithm As you can see in the picture 3 below, the solution has a several layers The lowest layer covers data sources. These data can be stored in traditional SQL databases \(data from MAIS or NoSQL databases \(data from social network\. For the storage of classical relation data can be use Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle databases or some several other products. Data that we need to save in any structure should be stored in NoSQL databases. One of the possible ways is to deploy Mongo database system In next layer is an Apache Hadoop. This system processes the huge amount of data from the lowest layer Advantage of this tool is fact that it can work with SAMI 2014 Ä IEEE 12th International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelli\gence and Informatics Ä January 23-25, 2014.

 Figure 3. Technical architecture NoSQL data and relation data. At the same level is Apache Hive tool. It would be easy to work with NoSQL data and transform them to RDBMS Now, we have a data warehouse in the middle layer. It does not matter, how technology is used. For example \226 we can use Microsoft SQL Server technology or some product from Oracle, IBM and so on. Creating data cubes from this data is now easy. In addition this concept is used for many years If you have a data warehouse, you can start with data mining application a try to find suitable model for data There are a few good software applications for this job \226 IBM SPSS or products from SAS Company The highest layer is only for creating useful analysis from obtained data. These analyses are output of process of possible change in education system at universities. In this layer may be several types of users such as teachers politicians, administrators at university and so on Software application from IBM \226 Cognos could be one of the possible ways  IV  CONCLUSION  Today, there are many software application and technologies supporting work with Big Data. This paper describes an option of using these technologies for processing of Big Data from technical perspective. It means that technical architecture has been designed. This architecture should be a suitable model for processing of Big Data from university\264s environment. Further, very important asset of this work is an identification of data sources from education environment. These sources have been divided to 5 groups. After this identification algorithm for processing of this data was designed Area of Big Data analysis from education data is not as simple as it might seem. Technical problem is only one puzzle piece in the mosaic. A view on processes is also very important. It would be great to identify all processes of creating new knowledge from this education data. We talk about Business Process Management \(BPM\ view. It means that assignment of process owners, identification of resources \(manpower, technical\d other aspects of BPM could be very helpful for further research  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work presented in this paper was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic project KEGA 021TUKE-4/2012 \(50 %\ and the Slovak Grant Agency of Ministry of Education and Academy of Science of the Slovak Republic under grant No. 1/1147/1 50 R EFERENCES  1  J.

atmospheric behavior Spectrophotometric measurements o f the helium oxygen and hydrogen spectral lines were taken on the Black Brant II sounding rocket launch in 1988 13  i n order to characterize aspects of the thermosphere/exosphe re plasma environment Such spectral measurements could potentially be used to determine gas densities within targe ted volumes using the principle of chemical actinometry 14  Carrying out SPS power beam experiments with the modied HAARP array could be timed to coincide with a launch for experimental measurement of the plasma state and gas species densities within a targeted volume coincidental wi th the rocket ight trajectory Weather Balloons Low-cost atmospheric soundings utilizing weather balloons as experimental platforms are widely deployed Gas density and plasma state observations can be made using UV photometry mass spectroscopy and electrochemical sondes Weather balloon experiments customdesigned for sensitivity to specic atmospheric parameter s can be deployed around the HAARP facility site during a radiation campaign to collect additional data on atmospher ic interactions of HAARP power beams Earth Observation Satellites The HAARP Diagnostic Satellite Scintillation SATSIN system has been used previousl y to characterize the structure and dynamics of ionospheric irregularities created during HF heating utilizing the pe rturbation and modulation of UHF/VHF signals from satellite beacons as they pass through the power beam volumetric area and near vicinity This system offers additional diagnosti c capabilities for the upgrade proposed in this paper as well by measuring ionosphere behavior e.g Ohmic heating response N e and T e variations observation of nonlinear effects In related work a joint HAARP/NASA experiment to detect the effects of a high power radiowave transmission on the magnetosphere was carried out by the WIND satellite radio and plasma wave detectors WAVE 15  Wh i l e t h e t a r g e t was in the high altitude magnetospheric band such future experiments could be tailored to be analogous to an SPS power beam and such measurements could prove insightful especially for geostationary positioned SPS systems 5 S UMMARY Only limited amounts of data are available concerning the interaction of microwave power beams with Earth's atmosphere It is expected that in-depth knowledge of atmospher ic power beam interactions is required for the certication an d licensing process of SSP and for raising public acceptance of SSP Review publications of microwave interactions with atmospheric layers suggest that further studies need to be conducted and that these studies should be of experimental nature due to expected non-linear effects which are difcul t to simulate The data generated from these experimental studies would provide key metrics in terms of characterizin g atmospheric interactions of SPS power beams This paper presents a rst analysis of a possible usage of the existing infrastructure of the HAARP facility in Alaska  USA towards establishing a large-scale and comprehensive knowledge base of scientic rigor about the interactions of power beams with all relevant atmospheric layers The power beam emulation capabilities of different scales of extensi on scenarios are compared The above studies suggest that already the smallest considered upgrade allows the collection of representative data describing the interactions of a LEO demonstrator SPS power beam with the atmosphere for modest cost Additionally atmospheric power beam interactions of utility-scale SPS can potentially be emula ted in a representative way by the largest considered upgrade In-depth knowledge of the interactions of high-energydensity microwave power beams with Earth's atmosphere is expected to be of critical importance to enable SPS deployment and large-scale development supported by US national government agencies international entities as well as the general public Utilizing existing ground-based faciliti es could represent a cost-effective and efcient way of gather ing the required data for modest amounts of funding 6 D ISCLAIMER Lockheed Martin Corporation does not
