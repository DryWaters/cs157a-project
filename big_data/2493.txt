INTRODUCTION  \nCyber-Physical Systems \(CPS dynamic systems with complex communication, \nproviding real-time monitoring and actuation services. That is \na paradigm of enabling ubiquitous computing to everything \nincluding physical processes and objects at large-scale. \nPhysical information is detected by sensors in sensing layer, \nand then the information is sent to processing layer through \ntransport layer. At last, processing layer processes the \ninformation and then sends appropriate decisions to physical \nactuators. From  this perspective, many existing networks such \nas satellite network, mobile network, wireless sensor network, \nembedded systems, even the internet  all fall into the concept \nof CPS[3]. It is different than MANET and WSN in following \naspect: Network formation Communication pattern, Power \nManagement , Network coverage , Node mobility, Knowledge \nmining and QoS [6 11]. \nCyber Physical Cloud \(CPC geographically, widely \nspread. These ubiquitous systems pose all characteristics of \ncloud environment mainly scalability and elasticity.  Sensor \nvirtualization   allows availability of sensor instance to various napplications from various tenants. Tight integration of   cyber \nand physical world poses    critically secure environment on \nCPC. Environment context in computation is main \ncharacteristics of these systems Building up cyber physical \ncloud itself faces following challenges: \n1. Virtualization layer for mobile sensors. \n2. Handling large amount of   real time   geographically \ndistributed data \(Bigdata intelligence in computation for   \ncontrolling and maintaining tight integration between \nphysical world and computation world. \nII. RELATED WORK \nMany papers are there to explain open source VM \nmanagers and cloud architectures. There are few sensor \nvirtualization frameworks like IoT open source cloud. In cyber \nphysical systems we require tight integration with the physical \nworld hence, what we require is sensor infrastructure ncollecting real time data, i.e. sensor cloud. According to \nIntelliSys, Sensor-Cloud can be defined as follows: An \ninfrastructure that allows truly pervasive computation using \nsensors as an interface between physical and cyber worlds, \nthe data-compute clusters as the cyber backbone and the \ninternet as the communication medium [8] . \nSensor cloud has following advantages:   data analysis, \nscalability collaboration,   visualization, free provisioning of \nincreased data, and dynamic provisioning of the services, \nmultitenancy, automation, flexibility and resource \noptimization. Here are some applications where these sensor \nclouds are used, environment monitoring for \nemergency/disaster detection, telematics, google health, \nMicrosoft health vault, aggregation and irrigation control, \nearth observation, transportation and vehicular traffic \nmanagement. \nThe key innovations in Cyber Physical Cloud Computing \n\(CPCC servers move in space and carry sensors \nand/or actuators. This means virtual vehicles have two kinds \nof mobility: a small-time-scale hop, we call cyber-mobility, \nand a larger-time-scale motion with the real vehicle called \nphysical mobility. In the paper [12] binding and migration \nproblem along with solution is discussed and also suggested \nthe cyber physical cloud architecture. Again at physical layer \nwe have sensors as well as actuators. Mainly these are \nembedded control system hence virtualization has two factors nprograms coded in mission languages as well as time of \nexecution on particular node. Also programs are with the \n2013 International Conference on Cloud & Ubiquitous Computing & Emerging Technologies\n978-0-4799-2235-2/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CUBE.2013.18\n4231\ncontrol states as per 


geographical locations as well as temporal \nparameters. \nIn paper [7] scheduling algorithm for assigning VV on nactuators is discussed .In the same paper a very interesting \nconcept of virtual vehicle network is introduced to handle the \ndata in the cloud. This concept is leading to formation of event \ntrigger overlaying networks. The main concern in the cyber \nphysical cloud is the data. We have ‘Big data’ handling which \nis real time data with large amount of volume, velocity and \nvariety. Data comes in stream. Data acquisition or information \nacquisition as a service is explained good in paper [7]which \nmay be useful for CPS research and design.   \nAs foundation of CPS, WSN observe physical systems by \nacquiring data and processing queries. Thus real time \npreemptive query and reply processing and communication as \nwell as energy conservation are fundamental issues in the \npaper.  In paper [9] work is done on the real time preemptive \nscheduling with a focus on QoD to analyze useful energy \nconsumption and interference energy consumption. They \nproposed  the novel method, called energy efficiency aware \nquality of data \(EAQD each query so that minimize the energy consumption \nin real time preemptive query scheduling.  With regard to CPS \nhow to support many applications with different quality \nrequirements and different   resources   in timeliness as well as \nhow to minimize the energy consumption are challenges today \nand even in the future nFrom above survey we can come to conclusion that there \nshould be one middleware which will act as the cloud manager \nin cooperation with Virtual manager or cloud controller for \nhandling all these data related and infrastructure related issues \n[2]. Service level agreements and quality of services \nacquisition are main objectives of the middleware. \nWhen we are talking about QoS   context-awareness is key \nfactor. Also the closed feedback loop in the CPC   forces us to \nhave Context- awareness or intelligence in the CPS. A survey nof context aware middleware [5] mainly describes types of the \ncontexts and main modules present in the middleware like \ncomposition, migration and adoption. \nLooking  at different application scenarios and the nmiddleware used we can consider middleware architecture \ndiscussed in following papers [13], Emergency medical \nservices access, reconfigurable  conveyor belt system [11], \nwhich extended RTCORBA for CPS. We have real time cloud \nmiddleware which are using publisher /subscriber model for \nthe implementation of the middleware. Service oriented \narchitecture for middleware is discussed in [11].  \n \nIII. ARCCHITECTURE FOR CAMCPC \n    This section describes CPC architecture Fig 1. and role of \ncontext-aware middleware. \n A.  Sensor Clusters\(SC1..SCn PL WSN are heterogeneous in nature. \nThey differ with respect to type of sensors, technologies, \ncommunication stack and protocol suits. Virtualization of these \nsensor carrying computers, devices and storage along with ncommunication devices, is there in CPC. The main purpose of \nthis sensor/actuator network is to have close interaction with \nphysical world/environment. These sensors are 24×7   sending \ndata for computation to cloud n \n    Fig1. Conceptual CPC \nB. Cloud controller/virtual machine manager\(CC sensor network, deployment of \nsensors is main concern. In CPC instead of sensors \ndeployment, sensors as service and it's provisioning is main \nconcern. Applications running on the CPC will get server \ninstances like normal cloud client, but these servers are \ncarrying sensors and actuators and moving in space. These nserver images are mobile. This mobility adds complexity in \nserver consolidation and resource provisioning Middleware is \nworking with any normal hypervisor like, XEN. It is supportive \nto VM for functionalities like domain handling, I/O handling \nand resource isolation. In resource isolation, along with spatial \nisolation temporal isolation is also important. Binding  and  \nmigration of these smart devices /sensors and  actuators is \nchallenging in CPC  .Construction of ad-hoc or overlaying \nnetwork will depend upon context  parameters related to \napplication, as well QoS  like security and latency will be \ncommon for all domain[10]. \n \nC Context- aware middleware\(CAM depending upon the environmental \nparameters and user profiles. Generally these services are \nsome control signals triggering actuators. This context-aware \ncomputation allows integration of external events into ncomputation.  \nConsider hospital information system. We have Electronic \nhealth records stored in information system. We have remotely \ndeployed body sensors at patient’s site and receiving real time \nbody parameters such as temperature, heart beats, blood \npressure etc. Depending upon theses readings and health \nrecord particular doctor can give instructions to nurse or \npatient himself to handle emergency conditions. Complete npatient history or record cannot be available to all \nstakeholders. Availability of records or sensor readings will \ndepend on category of stakeholder, environmental parameters \nand role of doctors and services demanded by application.   \nRR    …………………    \nPL  \nApplication Layer \nCC \nCAM \nSC1 SCn\n43\nAggregation of different events recognized by sensors will \ngive rise to complex event \(situation naction will be dependent. To get this context from sensor and \nglue it with user requirement and QoS context-aware \nmiddleware is necessary.  \nThe main characteristics of CPC middleware will be \ndecided on 


following: Environment, Data storage, Reflections \nand adaption. Context often implies a situation which affects a \nsystem which is external to the system \(external context internal context CPC is metamorphic \nform of sensor cloud. Sensor cloud uses MOM. It uses \npublish/subscribe design pattern which forms the distributed \nsystem. Publish/Subscribe systems allow many to many \ncommunication services hence it will give us high scalability. \nCommunication taking place is through 'events'. The \nmiddleware in CPC is event based middleware. Tight \nintegration of physical parameters in computation suggests ncontext-awareness for applications in CPC. It can be \ncharacterized as pervasive systems. Context awareness is main \nconcern for pervasive systems. Changes in the user's location \nand activity should be noted and tailored in application for \nservice provisioning. \nModeling any context aware system [7] includes following nactivities: 1 Context \nrepresentation. \nFig 2 shows   interaction of context-aware middleware \nwith cloud based application n \n \n \nFig2. CAM interaction with application \n     Cloud portal enables user to invoke the cloud service nCloud computing service interface\(CCSI back-end mobile \nWSN. The service may require any no. of resources and can \nchange during life time of service. Context broker and context \nmanager are main middleware components which are aware of \nsituation in physical and virtual and user environment, and do \nthe service adoptions and generation of control messages naccordingly. This context is collected from actual physical \nsensor clusters from environment and user application  context \nand with the help of rules, present at context repository, \nmapping of service ID takes place. New learned rules and \nontology will be updated with the help of context manager to \ncontext repository. \n Context-aware layer in the middleware have following \ncomponents: 1. Pre-processing 2.Context analyzer 3.Context \nprovider 4.Repository 5.Machine learning algorithms[13]. \nFig 3 Explains context-aware layer in CPC. \n       Context pre-processing is conversion of stream data in to \nthe standard format. Context analyzer will classify the data \nand assign to corresponding module. Context analyser will \nalso get rules and models to analyze/correlate real time data. It \nwill have inference engine to understand situation. Context \nprovider will get correct ID and mapping to particular service \nand directing that to broker. Context repository has following \nmodules: 1 Context-aware layer \nWith above architecture CAM has following functionalities \n1 n      Here we will have two modules Data conditioning and \nfiltering.  Data coming from the sensor is Bigdata with \nterabyte volume, velocity and variety.  It will be pre-processed   \nthrough data conditioning models for quality such as \nreliability, noise free. Basically measured data from various \nsensors is transferred from context convertor to context \nanalyser. Context repository stores context rules, information \nand resources As context analyzer has complex event \nprocessing with inference engine, depending upon rules \npresent in the repository context ID will be created and \nanalysis is done on the sensor data. \n2 and resource allocation:  \n       The virtualization layer performs three layer scheduling \nand allocation Real world access layer, virtualized overlay \nnetwork, and service virtualization layer. Semantic overlay nwill provide semantic network formation by maintaining \nontology and will be dependent on the environment context \nContext \nPre-\nprocessing \nContext \nAnalyzer \nContext \nProvider Broker \nLearning Model \nRepository nWSN Virtual \nSensors \nCCSI Cloud \nPortal \nContext Broker \nContext manager \n44\nand rules present in the context repository. We are targeting \nmainly security at various layers.  The main innovation here is \nrole based access control. Sensor network security is very \nimportant parameter and concern in the cyber physical cloud. \nDepending upon user profile and environment parameters \nsensors are forming overlay network. Now again depending \nupon user profile access to data will be given from virtual \nsensor network. \n3 Role based security maintenance, Load balancing, \nresponse time these are various QoS parameters we are \nworking with, in cloud based applications.  Cloud security is \nhandled on two levels at data base level as well at resource \nlevels Identity management and access control is important \nsolution towards this. In sensor cloud, access to sensors is \ngenerally main cause for fraud data. Hence Identity based \naccess to virtual sensors is one of the important advantage in \ncontext aware CPC. \nD. Application layer \(AL real time, embedded, \ncontrol systems. Data as a service or information as a service \nare the main cloud delivery model for these type of systems. \nMany controlling applications can be there at application \nlayer Disaster management, intelligent traffic control, \nEmergency health services, Robotic control networks are few nexamples. Mainly all these applications relay for information \ncollection from remote sites on cloud. Web services running at \napplication layer will be collecting data from various \ngeographically separated sites 


and performing operations on \nthis data to do control actions. \n           \nIV.   CONTEXT- AWARE ACCESS CONTROL IN \nCYBER PHYSICAL CLOUD \n \n‘Bigdata’ security and access control is main concern in the \ncloud environment. Context-aware role based access control is \nnovel approach which will take end to end security Security is \nhandled in two levels, at virtualization and at data base level. \nGeneralized role based access control define environmental \nrole to access private data and resource or sensor in CPC. \nEnvironmental parameters such as location, time influence to \nrole activation.. \nA. Context -aware access control schema: \n In dental healthcare, application must support hundreds of \nuser roles and access controls and permissions Following \nsection will define our implementation and context-aware \naccess control schema[1][8]. \nData Object:  Smallest unit accessed in application& can be \ntables, images, records, videos, access list etc.[11 nData Type: Prescriptions, X rays, Pathology reports, History, \nroles. It is group of objects with same attribute. \nData Set: Set of all objects in an application, here we have \ndental patient records, X rays Location, roles etc.  \nUser Set :Admin, Dental Hospital Doctor, Dental Hospital \nStaff,  Patient,  Managing Body, General Hospital Doctor, X-\nray Technician, Pathology Technician.  \n \nDefinition 1\(Context Type \(CT The defined properties such as  time, location, \ntemperature, O2 level, liquid level etc.,. Every application will \nhave their own context set such as: \nCS={CT1,CT2,CT3,……..CTn},1? i?n \nDepending upon application’s security requirement different \ncontext types are defined for access control. Now there will be ncomplex scenario which will be aggregation of this different \ncontext and trigger the ‘roles ‘in role based access control. \nContext Implementation \(CI types and return an object of \ntype CT. \nCI: CT1×CT2×……..×CTn?CT, n?0. \n \nDefination2 \(Context constraint It is a regular expression based on which security \nrequirement will be satisfied.   \nContext constraint clause1?clause2?……clause\(n n where \nCT=Context Type, OP=logical operator, Value = specific \ncontext value. \n     Take a scenario where we want to have a particular sensor \nreading, for example sugar level from particular ward’s \npatient. According to sensor reading insulin dose will get \nadjusted. Access to insulin pump will be restricted by \nparticular physician only, hence authentication is done for \nphysician, as dosage adjustment decision she will take. I will \nbe dependent on particular time slot and on the location of \nphysician.

EXPERIMENTATION DETAILS \nWe have tried to implement this concept on EC2 cloud with n.NET and C#. We have dental patient records and depending \nupon user profile we are getting access to part of record. Audit \nlogs are maintained.  Secondly we   put the hard coded context \nfile and then retrieve records Though the number of users, \nrecords, lab results, X-rays increased, the response time of the \nsystem is good.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nWe have put up two important concepts with this paper, hence \nconclusion can be twofold: \ni 


nof services for this type of systems can be improved by adding \nenvironmental context- awareness at the distributed \nmiddleware. \nii modifying traditional RBAC. \nWith this, Cyber physical cloud will get following benefits: \nA. Fine control of data and resource access:   \n     By integrating role based algorithms in the context-aware \nmiddleware we can achieve two level securities at the Data \nlevel as well at the resource level, as formation of the \noverlaying network depend on the context, which is part of \nmiddleware. Hence   filter design or classification schemes it \nmay depend upon this RBAC algorithm. And as data coming \nis Big data part of the data can be accessed via this algorithm. \nB. Active auditing scheme:   \n    This is most advantageous part of the total architecture nHere middleware can act as proxy with two interfaces. These \ninterfaces will act between access layer and resource \nmanagement layer. One of the interfaces will be receiving \nresponse context, SQL request and middleware function to \ntrigger report generation for illegal operations. Logs will be \ncreated and stored This will be used for future analysis and \nagain and can be used in learn model. \n \n Role base policy  \n nCreate Users  \nCreate Permissions  \n \nCreate roles &  Operations  \nRole Mapping to users  \n \nStop  \n46\nC Prevention of security:  \n    Some important attacks like  Denial of service ,Man in the \nmiddle attack Intrusions can be avoided with the help of this  \ncontext- aware role based and Active auditing scheme .Also nprediction algorithms can be build up and Intelligent intrusion \ndetection system can be build up with this CAM. \nD. Data confidentiality and integrity:   \n    With certain cryptographic algorithms and techniques like nthreshold cryptography can be used to get one step ahead \nsecurity for sensitive resources and data. \nE Performance analysis of proposed scheme and algorithm:   \n    From prototype implemented we have calculated the time \ncomplexity Algorithm required following steps: \nAccess request generation, policy matching verification \nsubject to policy, calculating verification   token and access \ngeneration response. Policy matching algorithms has \ncomplexity O \(N Other operations complexity is O \(1 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH \n \n     Cyber physical Cloud, IoT these architectures are directly \ninteracting with physical world. Decision making system is \nimportant part in this ubiquitous system. Heterogeneity nscalability, auto provisioning these important characteristics of \ncloud environment is accompanied with security, energy \nconsumptions and memory usage in CPC. Sensor network at \nbackend   and interaction with physical world put some extra \nconcerns in CPC. Environmental context- awareness in \ncomputation   will help us to improve total QoS in the system.  \n    In this paper first we discussed Context-aware middleware narchitecture in Cyber physical cloud .Secondly we have \nintroduced Novel access control scheme \(Context-aware Role \nbased Access complexity .   \n    We proposed the basic architecture. Enhancement on \nvarious parameters like Load balancing Migration and \ncloning decisions, Cryptographic algorithms like threshold \ncryptography for enhanced security can be used and possible. \nUse of social network and relationship based access control \ncan give better results. Our next research will be in Big data \nanalysis for CPC. Context- aware ‘Big data’ analysis can nimprove reliability and fault tolerance of Cyber Physical \nCloud.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \nI gratefully acknowledge to my research student Mrs. Gauri Bhange  \nfor helping me in carrying the experimentation.

whether the design \nand staffing of polling places would allow everyone to exercise their right to vote with tolerable waiting. \nHistorical voting patterns including numbers of voters by precinct, actual voter turnout and the percent-\nage of the vote cast by time of day were available, as well as ballot-dependent models of the time to cast a \nvote. Simulations were constructed to assess poll performance for any given staffing level equipment ca-\npacity or registration policies.  \n Here are some reasons why reporting the results of stochastic simulation experiments is not easy: \n Simulations generate a lot of data: Even this simple example generates delay data for each of hun-\ndreds to thousands of voters; congestion data for the polling place, the registration desk and the voting \ndevices; and utilization data for poll workers and voting devices. A complex manufacturing or supply \nchain simulation could easily increase the amount of data by one to two orders of magnitude. The im-\nmense volume of data is one reason that simulation software invariably provides summary reports, typi-\ncally averaging everything in sight; but averaging introduces its own problems. \n Averaging through time masks time-dependent effects: A critical feature of voting is time-varying \nload. In some precincts voting primarily takes place before or after working hours; but a precinct serving \na retirement community will experience a very different distribution of load. The delay experienced by \nvoters, averaged throughout the voting day, will hide the long delays experienced by some voters during \npeak load periods by averaging them with brief delays for voters off-peak. While averaging across repli-\ncations is always statistically helpful, averaging within replications may be bad. \n The performance that interests us is often related to time: Recall our generic output da-\nta nyyy ,,, 21 … . These might be voter waiting times during the simulated day. To be very specific, in a \ntypical simulation these could be the waiting times of n  voters in the order that they completed waiting. \nNotice first that the index is not the order of arrival to the polling place, nor the order of departure from it. \nBut even if the output data were sorted in one of these two ways, it is unlikely that we are interested in, \nsay 32y , the waiting time of the 32\nnd voter of the day to arrive. Instead, the anticipated waiting time as a \nfunction of the time of arrival is what is relevant For instance, what delay might a voter expect who ar-\nrives at noon as opposed to 5 PM?  I am willing to argue that for nearly all systems with time-varying \nload, measures of delay should be indexed by time. But this a more subtle measure to define and estimate. \n A related problem is reporting results for continuous-time outputs, like queue length tQ . These out-\nputs are naturally indexed by time, so it is easy to generate a within-replication time plot of tQ  vs. t  as \nnearly all simulation languages do. Averaging such data across replications to get a better estimate of \nmean queue length as a function of time is certainly meaningful, but how do you do it? The most straight-\nforward way requires saving lots of data from each replication \(the values of itQ and it  at each point in \ntime it  when it changed amount of post-run computation. If a measure of varia-\nbility around this mean queue length is reported, as it should be, then there is even more work. Yet this is \nexactly the sort of information that would be meaningful in the voting model. \n Simulations are conducted in a sequential, exploratory manner: In classical design of experi-\nments, important factors are identified, levels of the factors are chosen, and all of these predefined exper-\niments are executed and the results analyzed. However, since simulations are not physical experiments ndata \(“runs to conduct some simulation studies in a more exploratory fashion. In the voting simulation we might \npick a particular layout and staff, make a few runs, look for problems, and adjust the staffing and capacity \nwhere we see congestion or idleness. How do we summarize a user-guided sequence of experiments on \ndifferent scenarios so as to insure that they did not miss something or get mislead? \n We focus on reporting error instead of risk: We have a historical focus on measures of error while \ndecisions should usually be based on measures of risk; even worse, users often confuse error with risk. A \nconfidence interval \(CI error; measures of error answer the question “have we done \n1278\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nenough simulation to estimate whatever?” The answer should be related to the specific context like “I am \ncomfortable being off by ±$1000, but not ±$50,000.” The width of a CI says nothing about the natural \nsystem variability; that is, it says nothing about risk, although many people think that it does. A prediction \ninterval \(PI see when \nwe implement?” Measures of risk should be standard, but they are not. And when reporting either type of \nmeasure we should avoid statistically meaningless precision. See Nelson \(2008 2009 and Wieland and Nelson \(2009 and competing scenarios: It is a rare simulation that pro-\nduces only a single output measure, and for each output there may be more than one property we care \nabout. Trade-offs between costs, quality of service physical space, etc. are common. For some perfor-\nmance measures, the mean \(long-run average 


stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
