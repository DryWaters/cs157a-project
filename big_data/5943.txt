It is well known that the radio frequency identification \(RFID\ technology can enhance information visibility and traceability in supply chain 2  I n re ce nt y e ar s, a s t h e  a ppl i c at i o n o f RF I D t e c hno l o gy ha s  become economically feasible in labor-intensive manufacturing industry, some RFID-based information systems have been developed to collect accurate production data and track production progress real-timely, and their effectiveness has been proved by various industrial applications and practices However, the existing data capture and tracking systems are designed for a separate plant. Nowadays, Chinaês laborintensive companies in global manufacturing usually produce 
production orders in multiple subordinate and collaborative plants located in different regions. To track production in all plants effectively, some companies develop additional systems to integrate production data from different plants and save these data into a central database located at the headquarters However, it is technologically complicated to synchronize the database located in different regions real-timely, and it also needs extra costs for secondary development and maintenance It is thus necessary to develop an effective system to track and monitor the production progress in a distributed production manufacturing involving multiple production plants located in different regions. In recent years, cloud-based systems and 
applications have emerged as an important trend in information technology, which have been applied successfully in various organizations from government [3 m a nufa c t ur i ng [4  healthca n d ed uca t i o n 6 s e ct or s  H o w e ve r, c l o u d b a sed application in production tracking, and production decisionmaking has not been reported in labor-intensive manufacturing industries so far Existing data capture systems installed in each plant can collect a huge number of real-time production data from production frontlines in labor-intensive manufacturing However, these abundant data collected are mainly utilized for payroll recording and simple production reporting. There exists 
difficulty for production management to use these collected data to make effective production scheduling decisions Todayês labor-intensive manufacturing is characterized by short lead-time, short life-cycle, volatile customer demands and distributed multi-plant production environment.

production plants for production.  Each order consists of a maximum of production processes which need to be performed in production departments 1 to  respectively. That is, production process can only be produced in production department  Each production process of an order is assigned to only one plant for processing, which indicates that it is possible that different production processes of an order need to be performed in different plants. In real-world production practice, scheduling tasks are performed by production management at different management levels, respectively, so as to assign production tasks to appropriate production units. Some important realworld problem features in production scheduling of laborintensive manufacturing need to be considered, including multiple scheduling objectives and various uncertainties The problem addressed aims at tracking and monitoring each orderês production progress accurately from material production to packing process in a real-time manner and determining where and when each production process of each order needs to be produced based on real-time data III C LOUD BASED INTELLIGENT TRACKING AND SCHEDULING SYSTEM  Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the CITSS. RFID technology is used to collected production data from distributed manufacturing environments on a real-time basis while intelligent optimization techniques are used to make scheduling decisions. This architecture involves an RFIDbased production data capture \(RPDC\odel, a data capture middleware, a real-time production database, a data analysis and processing \(DAP\model, a production decision-making database, a cloud-based real-time production tracking \(CRPT model and a remote intelligent production scheduling \(RIPS model. Except for the RPDC model running in distributed plants, other models are all run remotely in the servers located at the companyês headquarters. This architecture is thus a cloud-based system architecture. Further speaking, this architecture fits in the concept of community cloud The RPDC model is in charge of collecting real-time production records, from each workstation in all plants based on RFID technology. These production records collected are transferred to the remote data capture middleware, which is in charge of receiving the data from the RPDC model, entering the production data into the real-time production database and providing access to the data. The real-time production database stores production data by using MySQL, MS SQL Server, or Oracle according to specific data processing requirements Based on the data collected, the DAP model analyzes and preprocesses these data, extracts necessary summary data and then save them into the production decision-making database Based on the data collected, the CRPT model is developed to track and monitor the production progress of each production order in plants. The RISD model is developed to generate effective scheduling decisions based on intelligent optimization techniques. These models provide user-friendly interfaces to remotely interact with users from different production units 
Flowchart of production task allocation after receiving orders  The manufacturing company receives various production orders from different customers. Each group of production orders with the same due date from a same customer are called as an order group. After customer orders of an order group are confirmed, the manufacturer needs to purchase raw materials from material suppliers according to the materials requirement of customer orders. Labor-intensive manufacturing industries such as apparel and footwear are usually characterized by quick response manufacturing. It is very important to obtain raw materials in a timely manner. It is thus crucial to track the materialsê production so as to effectively monitor and control their production progress in suppliersê plants. Moreover, to enhance production visibility, all production processes of customer orders need to be tracked and monitored effectively Especially, manual operations have large effects on production performance in labor-intensive manufacturing, which are prone to being production bottleneck. Thus, production in workstations with key manual operations need to be tracked Production management at different management levels have different tracking requirements according to their responsibilities. For example, production management at the head company need to track and oversee all orders while shop managers only need to track the orders in their shop floors In a distributed labor-intensive environment with multiple plants, the purpose of production scheduling is to assign various production orders to appropriate shop floors or assembly lines of

 production departments. The departments of ordinary category are fully contained in all plants but it is possible that those of special category are only partly included \(or not included\ in some plants. Each department consists of multiple shop floors while each shop floor consists of multiple workstations or multiple assembly lines consisting of workstations. Each workstation is usually a physical location that accommodates an operator, a machine and a buffer. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the manufacturing company and the flowchart of production task allocation after receiving customer orders.

 based on web technologies. The following subsections describe four key models of the CITSS  Fig. 2. CITSS architecture for production tracking and scheduling  
The RPDC model is composed of submodels installed in each plant. Fig. 3 shows the structure of an RPDC submodel installed in a shop floor or an assembly line. Each shop floor or assembly line uses the same way to collect production records In each workstation, an RFID terminal is installed, which reads the RFID tag attached to each workpiece to capture the starting time and the end time of each workpiece being processed on this workstation. The RFID terminals in each submodel are integrated into an intranet by the switch. The switch is a device that channels incoming data from any of the multiple input ports to the specified output port that takes the data toward its intended destination, which is connected with a data capture middleware. The data communication between the switch and the middleware uses the TCP/IP protocol The RFID tags used in this model are passive RFID tags with the low frequency of 125 KHZ, which are low cost and technically mature for industrial use. Only the tag ID is stored in the memory of the tag. Other information related to the RFID tags is stored in the remote real-time production database. Each tag ID is mapped with the additional information of the tag through the real-time production database Except for the data collected by the RFID terminals, some information, including the given data of production orders shop floors, assembly lines, workstations and operators, are also input directly by computer operators from each shop floor through a web-based program imbedded into the RPDC model The program provides the computer operator an user-friendly interface to input related production information    Fig. 3. Structure of RPDC submodel installed in a shop floor or assembly line  The amount of real-time production data collected from production frontline is huge. Although a huge number of realtime production records are collected, only these raw data are insufficient to implement production tracking and making production decisions. The DAP model is thus developed to extract necessary parameters from the real-time production database and placed them into the production decision-making database according to specific tracking and scheduling requirements. The necessary parameters are used in CRPT and RISD models, which include: \(1\e operator and machine configuration of each production unit; \(2\he information of each order, including operations involved in this order and each operationês standard allowed minute \(SAM\ \(3\ daily working records of each operator Production management at different management levels including company, plant and shop levels, need to track and monitor the production progress of customer orders timely and accurately according to their job responsibilities. The CRPT model is thus designed and developed by integrating production tracking functions at 3 different levels, namely company level, plant level and shop floor level Fig. 4 shows the structure of the CRPT model. This model is actually a web-based production monitoring program, which connects with the remote production decision-making database and provides a user friendly web portal to help production management  to track and monitor each orderês production progress. The web portal gives production management at different levels easy access to the information consistent with their job requirements. The users at each management level can browse information related to his/her job responsibility by web browsers in microcomputers and mobile phones with Internet connections according to their access rights

E Remote intelligent production scheduling model 
  Fig. 4. Structure of the CRPT model  
An intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is presented to handle production scheduling tasks at different management levels from a holistic perspective. Production management at different levels need to determine how to assign orders to appropriate production units and the processing sequences of these orders in these production units Fig. 5 shows the flowchart of the RIPS model for a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment involving multiple plants. The scheduling mechanism in this model implements production scheduling task in the distributed environment by decomposing the scheduling task into 3 order scheduling problems at the following 3 management levels   Fig. 5. Flowchart of the RIPS model 1\ompany level: After new production orders from a customer is confirmed,  the order scheduling submodel at company level determines how to assign each production order from customers to an appropriate plant 2\ Plant level: After production order assigned by the head company are confirmed, the order scheduling submodel at the plant level decides how to assign each order from the head company to one or more appropriate shop floors in this plant 3\ level: The scheduling submodel at this level decides how to schedule the production of orders in a shop floor. In some production environments such as sewing, each shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines. In this case, it is necessary to decide how to assign orders to each assembly line Production orders are assigned for production according to the scheduling solutions generated. After a group of orders from a customer is produced, the finished products are finally delivered to the destinations specified by the customer. In addition, users at different management levels can access these scheduling submodels through Internet connections Scheduling solutions at each management level are saved into the production decision-making database on a real-time basis and used as input parameters of scheduling and decisionmaking processes at lower management level so that more transparent and timely information sharing can be achieved In real-world production practice, the three scheduling problems at different levels need to consider various laborintensive production features, such as multiple plants, multiple shop floors, multiple orders, multiple production objectives and production uncertainties. These features make these problems become complex uncertain multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, for which traditional optimization techniques cannot provide optimal or near-optimal solutions The first author has proposed a hybrid intelligent decisionmaking model to solve an order allocation problem with the consideration of multiple objectives production uncertainties 9   In th is m o d e l v a r i o u s p r o d u c ti o n u n c e r ta in ties su ch as  uncertain order arrival time and uncertain processing time, are described by random variables, multi-objective intelligent optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are integrated to generate Pareto optimal solutions.  The optimumseeking process of the hybrid intelligent model can be utilized to handle production scheduling problems at different levels The main procedures involved in this optimum-seeking process can be described briefly as follows 1\ multi-objective intelligent optimization submodel is adopted firstly to generate the initial Pareto optimal solutions to the deterministic production scheduling problem. The deterministic problem does not consider production uncertainty by assuming that all uncertain orders need to be produced and the processing time of an order in a production department equals the mean of its processing time in this department 2\ To tackle the stochastic production scheduling problem the Monte Carlo simulation submodel is then employed to evaluate performance \(fitness\ of each initial Pareto optimal solution under various uncertainties in production scheduling

S YSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION  To evaluate the effectiveness of the CITSS architecture proposed in section III, a pilot system was developed and a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants was selected as the pilot company to evaluate this system. The  pilot manufacturing company has 4 production plants located in 4 different cities, which receives production orders from its global customers and produces these order in its 4 plants according to customersê requirements.  These plants include 5 types of production departments, including cutting silk-screen, sewing, finishing and packaging. Each production department includes one or more shop floors. Each sewing shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines while other shop floor consists of multiple workstations. In each plant, different production departments are included The pilot system contains the functions of remote production tracking and production scheduling at company level. In the pilot manufacturing company,  one shop floor in each production department of each plant was selected out to implement and test the pilot system In apparel manufacturing, sewing production has the largest effects on production performance of each plant. An RFID terminal is thus installed in each sewing workstation in sewing assembly lines to capture the production records of each sewing operations. In cutting department, RFID terminals are installed in each cutting workstation to capture the output of cutting pieces from each cutting bed. In silk-screen department each bundle of garments is collected while the production record of each piece of garment is collected in finishing department. In packing department, RFID terminals collect the records of each carton of garments. In addition, three RFID terminals are installed in a fabric supplierês shop floors to track the production progress of main fabric materials The pilot system was developed on the basis of Java/J2EE SQL Server 2005 and web technologies. The production management at different levels can track the production progress of each order by some summarized reports, and also assign each order to an appropriate plant. Some examples of interfaces of the pilot system are shown in Fig.s 6-8 Fig. 6 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production efficiency and progress for different operationsê in a production unit. By this interface, one can compare the average efficiency and progress of different operations of a production order being processed in a plant, a production department, a shop floor or an assembly line. It can be clearly found if the production flow of an order is smooth in a production unit. One can also compare the actual operating time of each operation with its SAM value by this interface. For example, the average operating time of operation è001ê and its SAM value is 20 and 22 seconds respectively. This interface can be used by production management at different levels to track each orderês production detail   Fig. 6. Interface 1 Ö Production detail of operations in an order  Fig. 7. Interface 2 Ö Production detail of orders in an order group   Fig. 7 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production progress of all orders in an order group, which is designed for production management at plant and company levels to track each order and each order groupês production progress. As shown in this figure, the order group çNKESP01B1é consists of 21 orders. On the whole, 55% total workload of this order group has been completed. 89 workload of order 2 has been completed while only 18 workload of order 9 was completed. By this interface, one can compare the production progress and average operating time for each product of different orders in an order group Fig. 8 shows the interface of showing the solution of assigning production orders to different plants, which is the result of production scheduling at company level. As shown in this figure, the orders of order group èNIT-WI12-2Bê are assigned to plant 2 while the orders of order group èOKYSP13-1Sê are assigned to plant 1 for processing. Each production order can only be assigned to one plant for

B Evaluation 
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated by examining the benefits brought by the pilot system. Before the pilot system was developed and implemented in the pilot manufacturing company, production data were collected by manual recordings and the production management could not track the production progress of each order in a real-time and accurate manner. The production schedulers at the headquarters made production scheduling decisions by assigning each order to an appropriate plant based on their experience and subjective judgments, which generated lowly efficient solutions After the pilot system was run in the pilot company for more than 6 months, the system performance was analyzed and evaluated by comparing the production performance of latest 3 months and the performance of the same 3 months of last year before the system was implemented. On the basis of the comparison in the two selected periods, the pilot company reported that the following tangible benefits have been achieved 1\ 8% reduction in labor and system costs: No computer operator is required to input job tickets records now. The pilot system needs less computer servers, less installation and maintenance costs, less IT-related and IE-related manpower 2\5% increase in production efficiency: The real-time and accurate production data collected and effective production scheduling decisions generated by the pilot system can definitely improve production efficiencies 3\ 12% reduction in production waste: Effective order tracking and monitoring leads to more transparent production process, which has direct effects on reducing overproduction defects, and in-process inventories. Effective order scheduling decreases the possibility of rush production, which is also helpful to reduce defects V C ONCLUSIONS  A production tracking and scheduling system was developed to make effective production tracking and scheduling in a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment based on a cloud-based system architecture and 3 different management levels. Due to its cloud-based and easily accessible feature, except for the subordinate plants, real-time production data can also be collected conveniently from supplying and outsourcing plants. These data collected are transferred to remote real-time production database via TCP/IP protocol, and are then analyzed and extracted to be used in production scheduling decision-makings. The intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is able to handle production scheduling tasks in distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environments from a holistic perspective The effectiveness of the CITSS was validated by the application of a pilot system in a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants. By implementing this system, better supply chain coordination and better production scheduling decisions can be achieved so as to provide its customers with better services A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors acknowledge the financial  supports from the Sichuan University \(Grant No. SKYB201301\ and the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No 000\021 71302134 R EFERENCES  1 K  B u t n er, "Th e s m a r t e r sup p ly ch ai n of t h e f u tu re

limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a similar effectiveness R EFERENCES  D DeW itt and J Gray   P arallel Database Systems the Future of Highperformance Database Systems Commun  vol 35 no 6 pp 85Ö98 1992  J Dean and S Ghema w at MapReduce

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
