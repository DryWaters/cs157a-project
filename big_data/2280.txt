Energy\n“Big Data” analytics can lead to a plethora of new innovative\napplications and enhance decision making processes However,\nto do so, we need new enterprise tools and approaches that can\ntake into consideration the specifics of the energy domain and\noffer high performance analytics on its raw data. In this work,\nexperiments are conducted to measure the performance of the\ndifferent levels of energy data aggregation. Thousands of smart\nmeters are aggregated, by usage of the collected energy readings\nfrom a real-world trial. Using a selected dataset, the traditional\ndatabase system \(row-based column-based approach in order to assess the suitability\nfor real-time analytics in such scenarios.\nI INTRODUCTION\nThe emergence of the Smart Grid [1] brings into foreground\na modern information-centric infrastructure [2] where a new\ngeneration of innovative applications and services can be re-\nalized. Due to the prevalence of networked embedded devices\n[3], fine grained energy related data is expected to be collected,\nresulting to huge amounts of information in minutes, or even\nseconds, that can provide new insights. The acquisition of\nthis “Big Data” as well as its assessment within a business\nspecific context and extraction of information, preferably in\nreal-time, poses a grand challenge. As the real value creation\nin big data is analytics [4], their high quality, effectiveness and\ntimely delivery may lead to significant competitive business\nadvantage.\nAlthough there are several application domains, complex\ninfrastructure such as the emerging smart cities can benefit\nfrom real-time analytics. There, monitoring of energy related\naspects is seen as an integral aspect of several key performance\nindicators that are considered in decision making processes.\nFor instance analytics on the vast amount of energy data [5]\ncan lead to better prediction of energy customers [6] and\noffer new energy-related services [7] both in residential as\nwell as in industrial 8] environments. Timely assessment and\nunderstanding may lead to qualitative better decisions and\nassist for instance city administrators to better run them. As\nan example a smart city energy cockpit providing city-wide\ninformation on energy usage and comparative analysis may\nenhance empower city officials to take decisions towards better\nenergy management, CO2 reduction, dynamic RES integration,\nEV charging, public infrastructure energy cost reduction, city\ninvestment planning, simulation of “what-if” scenarios, etc.\nTo do so however, integration of multiple sources of data is\nneeded, and subsequently highly complex processing should\nbe applied e.g., at city, neighborhood, or even smart house or\nbuilding level.\nMany of the enterprise systems are relying on the Online\nTransaction Processing \(OLTP high-performance analytics has given rise to\nseparate specialized systems delivering Online Analytical Pro-\ncessing \(OLAP the drastic\nperformance improvements of in-memory systems, using an\nin-memory column database has some profound implications\n[9]. Independent of the row vs. column comparisons [10],\nthe performance of the in-memory well as transactional workload environments [11].\nToday there are several open source e.g. MonetDB www.\nmonetdb.org   metering data as-\nsessment and do an assessment by using a traditional DB \(i.e.\nMySQL variant, and an in-memory\ncolumn-based DB \(i.e. MonetDB energy measurement aggregations by\nusing out-of-the box existing DBs without really diving deep\nto their tuning which could yell some additional performance\nbenefits.\nII. DATA PROCESSING\nSeveral experiments were carried out measuring the aggre-\ngation performance of smart metering data. For all of them,\nwe have used a real-world dataset acquired during the trials\nof the NOBEL \(www.ict-nobel.eu been collected by an enterprise Integration and Energy\nManagement system \(IEM  cumulative\ntime series of smart meter energy readings. The meters have\nan energy resolution of 1 kWh that is sampled in resolution\nfrom 15 minutes to one hour \(depending on the meter samples were constant and\ntherefore were removed from the raw data set to reduce the\noverall amount. This has resulted in having measurements with\ndifferent time distances and are not available for every hour As\naggregation of time series data needs regular time resolutions,\nthis implies that we need to use interpolation in order to\nprovide data that fulfills this requirement. Their removal not\n978-1-4799-0752-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 434\nonly reduced the size of the set, but as such the precision is\nimproved after an interpolation step.\nTwo different approaches for executing the data aggregation\nstep are considered for this work i.e.,\ni 


aggregating it: here the advantage\nis flexibility on the required sampling resolution, since\nthe interpolation is done during runtime. Although, this\napproach leads to reduced usage of storage, the disad-\nvantage is that the individual smart meter interpolation is\ndone during runtime \(for a selected group to lower performance.\nii advantage may lie in skipping\nthe individual interpolation within a group, but this ap-\nproach requires much higher storage. Additionally, the\nflexibility is constrained by fixing the time resolution of\nthe interpolation. However, the aggregation simplicity in\nruntime of the fixed resolution is expected to result in\nbetter performance.\nTo clearly depict the difference between traditional and\nemerging tools, we have used two open source DBs i.e.\nMySQL which represents the traditional row-based domain\nand the MonetDB representing the emerging column-based\nworld. MySQL can store smart metering data on the hard drive\nand in memory, while the MonetDB by default stores all data\nin memory. To show the benefits of the in memory storage over\nthe traditional solution InnoDB \(hard drive both are part of MySQL of the\nInnoDB engine was due its caching algorithm of the frequently\naccessed data. As cached data is kept in memory, time to\naccess the data can be reduced, but it still may require to\naccess some data located on the hard disk. The in-memory\nstorage engine by contrast, stores all the data completely in\nmemory and no access on the hard disk is required.\nBased on the need for interpolating the raw data set and\nthe investigation of the smart meter grouping behavior, a\nstored procedure for group interpolation is implemented for\nthe traditional solution. This procedure is invoked by a thin\nclient for a specified group \(of numerous smart meters the\ntime frame and the resolution of the interpolated series. The\nboundary points, before the first and after the last data point,\nare also required in order to calculate the entire interpolation\ntime frame. For simplicity reasons the algorithm is imple-\nmented as the linear interpolation method. As such, within\nthe group interpolation procedure, every single device of the\ngroup is interpolated individually and subsequently all the\nsmart meters are aggregated to a single time series. The\nexperiments conducted in section IV will help us understand\nwhy the interpolation stored procedure was required, and how\nit differs from a distinctive feature of column stores that can\napply aggressive data compression.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT\nOur original dataset consists of 5032 different smart meter\ndevices and more than 3 million unique meter readings For\nthe experiments, two subsets were created from the original\ndataset; the first subset contains the data for only one month,\nwhereas the second subset is complete with about six months\nof smart metering data. A detailed overview of the created\ndatasets is provided in Table I.\nTable I\nOVERVIEW OF THE TWO DATA SETS USED IN EXPERIMENTS\nSet A \(reduced complete 1 month 6 months device 2 880 16 332\nInterpolated count 11 581 620 71 571 206\nAs one can note in the table, the 15 minute interpolation will\nsignificantly increase the total number of points. The original\nsets will be referred to as A and B, while pre-interpolated sets\nwill be noted as A? and B?. Furthermore, the set distributions\nof the meter readings play a significant role in understanding\nthe experimental results. As duplicates and constant values of\nenergy readings were removed from the set beforehand, the\nfinal set description was calculated based on percentage of\nmeter readings present in the set. More real meter readings\navailable in the set will result in less interpolated points \(as\nseen in section II presented in Figure 1.\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n0.\n00\n0.\n05\n0.\n10\n0.\n15\ndensity.default\(x = m62[, 3 per device reducted complete in the complete set\nThe described datasets \(see Table I DBMS. In MySQL, the B-\nTree index for the device and timestamp columns was assigned\nto the database table. The B-Tree index is appropriate for\nthe aggregation queries because they make use of bigger-than\nand lower-than comparisons. The MonetDB creates indices\nmanaged internally by the DBMS itself with the different\ncompression techniques executed automatically at many levels.\nSince the selected DBMSs for comparison were running on\ntwo different machines, certain impact of different hardware\ncomposition can be expected to influence the presented results.\nHowever, both machines featured the standard configuration\n435\nof the DBMSs, thus further optimizations can be realized \(but\nare beyond this work machine configurations are depicted in Table II.\nTable II\nOVERVIEW OF THE TWO EXPERIMENT MACHINES\nMachine 1 Machine 2\nDBMS MySQL MonetDB\nStorage type row store column store\nStorage engine InnoDB/in-\nmemory\nin-memory\nIO latency local, < 1 ms local, < 1 ms\nCPU 2 x Core2Duo\nE8400 \(3 GHz 2.8 GHz GB\nAlthough the presented machines in the table should not\nmake significant impact to process the defined datasets, possi-\nble overheads still need to be considered. These overheads are\nexpected to be eliminated \(to certain extent 


of devices, that significantly increases, the\nexecution time per device will be mostly impacted by small\ngroup sizes. If the number of smart meters within a group is\nsmall, the division with overall execution time will show low\nperformance results. This \(constant overhead is shared among\nall devices in the group composition.\nIV. AGGREGATION PERFORMANCE\nAggregation of the energy reading may be performed with\nmultiple approaches as mentioned in section II. The first ap-\nproach executes aggregation on the original measurements that\ncontain no constant readings of energy. As already explained,\nthis approach requires individual interpolation of the smart\nmeters in order to be aggregated. The aggregation in the\nsecond approach is done on the pre-interpolated data, which\nactually requires more storage space, but the aggregation\noperation approximates to the weight of the regular GROUP\nBY statement of SQL. In this section, performance of both\napproaches is evaluated by the aforementioned DBMSs on\ndata sets of different sizes. The results of the experiments are\nalways referring to the time frame of one month \(i.e Sept.\n2012 readings of smart meters is not made\non equal frequency, or if samples are lost, the sampling fre-\nquency needs to be adjusted. The original datasets, presented\nin section III, have the distorted samples of energy readings\ncollected from the smart meters. As such, the aggregation step\nwill require data \(of interest interpolated at runtime.\nOnce raw data is collected \(by submitting an SQL query to\na DBMS interpolation is executed and the\naggregation step is performed. The performance results of\nthose complete operations is presented as the execution time\nin relation to the group size for the two different MySQL\nengines. However, the relevance of the overhead as explained\nin section III should be noted as can be witnessed in all\nexperiments, and resulted in higher execution times for all\nsmall groups e.g. of less than 50 devices.\nFor the InnoDB case, the experiences are conducted on\nthe reduced and complete set, respectively set A and B. A\nperformance comparison is made by the count of rows in the\ntable, thus the storage size required to be processed by the\nMySQL DBMS instance. Their comparison will offer a better\nunderstanding of how the execution time differs, when data\nsets of significant different sizes are stored on a hard disk.\nThe interpolation algorithms presented in section II are used\nfor both sets and the results are shown in Figure 2.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nExecution time per device for interpolation and aggregation MySQL InnoDB\nGroup size\nEx\ne\ncu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne \npe\nr d\nev\nic\ne \n[m\ns]\nInnoDb \(A B for interpolation and aggregation with the MySQL\nInnoDB engine\nThe execution time per device decreases with a higher\ngroup size for both datasets. However, one can also witness\nthat the performance of the InnoDB engine suffers from the\nincrease in the dataset size. This execution difference does\nnot scale linearly with the size of the set, since the size of the\nset B is more than 6-fold. Still, because hard disk access is\ntoo expensive one can immediately notice how performance\nsuffers from the overhead for smaller group sizes. Finally, one\ncan conclude that both scenarios continuously converge to the\nconstant execution times per device as the group size increases.\nThe same experiment is also conducted with the MySQL\nin-memory engine. In contrast to the InnoDB engine, where\nperformance of hard disk I/O operations must be considered,\nthe in-memory engine stores the complete data set in memory.\nAs for InnoDB, experiments here also use the stored proce-\ndure interpolation algorithm \(as explained in section II can see the slight performance drop of the algorithm\nrunning on the complete set B. A significant convergence rate\ncan be also noticed, in comparison to InnoDB, even for very\nsmall group sizes. However, it is interesting to see that the\nInnoDB engine for set B. performed almost equally to the in-\nmemory engine on the reduced set A. Since these results show\nthat the runtime is not significantly affected by the dataset size,\nfurther analysis is conducted.\nAlthough comparable results with in-memory and InnoDB\n436\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n50\n55\n60\n65\nExecution time per device for interpolation and aggregation MySQL ?

The interpolation procedure of the\nInnoDB engine dropped for approximately 20 ms, while in-\nmemory engine suffered only a drop of approximately 2 ms\n\(between set A and B thousands of devices within a group.\nAs depicted on Figure 4, the distance is expected to further\nincrease if a lager dataset is used.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n60\n70\n80\n90\nComparison for interpolation and aggregation MySQL\nGroup size\nEx\ne\ncu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne \npe\nr d\nev\nic\ne \n[m\ns]\nInnoDb \(B B comparison of the interpolation and aggregation\nOne can conclude that the in-memory engine performed\nbetter for all group sizes, while the InnoDB suffered ap-\nproximately 10-fold more than the in-memory engine by the\nincrease of the set size. Although the execution times in\nInnoDB keep decreasing for the bigger groups 


the focus on\nvery large groups \(e.g. beyond 4000 devices conclude that even for\nthe better performing engine, the aggregation will still take\napprox. 60 seconds for a group of 1000 devices. In real\nworld applications, such analysis may require much higher\nperformance especially in near real-time systems. In seek for\na solution with better performance, and more efficient usage of\nthe available resources [14], further experiments are conducted\nas these are demonstrated in subsection IV-B.\nB. Aggregation on pre-interpolated data\nIn contrast to the experiment depicted in subsection IV-A,\nthe aggregation here is made over pre-interpolated data. The\ndistorted samples of energy readings within the original data\nsets \(A and B A? and B the smart meters have the\nsame sampling frequency \(as this is stored within the DBMS some disadvantages such as fixing the\nsampling resolution and increasing the storage requirements,\nhowever it is expected to improve performance by reducing\nthe aggregation time needed.\nFor the experiments carried out here, the sampling reso-\nlution was fixed to 15 minutes and contains a much higher\ncount of sampling points as shown in Table I. Via this\npreprocessing step, the interpolated data can be aggregated\ndirectly by executing a simple SQL query i.e. a GROUP\nBY statement. The performance of the complete operation is\npresented in form of the execution time with respect to the\ngroup size \(for both MySQL and MonetDB the\nprevious experiment, the relevance of the overhead explained\nin section III is included in all the experiments.\nFirst the MySQL case is considered for both DBMS engines\n\(InnoDB and in-memory the reduced set A\nand complete set B. However, for the in-memory experiments\nthe complete set of pre-interpolated meter readings could not\nfit the available physical memory of the machine. Still an\nassumption can be made, from the previous results of the in-\nmemory experiments, that the execution time will not differ\nsignificantly in case of bigger data sets. Figure 5 depicts results\nof these experiments.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n50\n10\n0\n15\n0\n20\n0\n25\n0\nExecution time per device for pre?interpolated data MySQL\nGroup size\nEx\ne\ncu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne \npe\nr d\nev\nic\ne \n[m\ns]\nInnoDb \(A B A time for the pre-interpolated data with the MySQL\nAlthough the InnoDB shows an exponential performance\nimprovement for higher group sizes for both sets, if compared\nto the results from subsection IV-A we conclude that it faced a\ndrastic drop in the performance. Obviously, these results show\nonce more that the performance of the InnoDB engine is highly\npenalized by the size of the dataset. The in-memory engine\n437\nshows exactly the opposite behavior, at least for the reduced\npre-interpolated set A Interestingly the engine performed\nvery good for all group sizes, especially if compared to the\nresults of previous experiments \(depicted on Figure 4 engine\nperformed a lot faster, because the high-cost access time to the\nhard disk do not incur. As an indicative example, the execution\ntime for group sizes of 1000 with the InnoDB is approximately\n60 ms, while for the in-memory engine resulted in only 1.5\nms.\nDue to the superior performance of the in-memory engine,\nit was decided to experiment with an in-memory column based\nDBMS i.e. the MonetDB, and conduct the same experiments.\nIn contrast to the in-memory case of the MySQL experiments,\nthe MonetDB solution has no problem storing reduced and\ncomplete datasets in memory. A distinctive feature of column\nstores is the application of aggressive data compression. In this\nway, one can use compression and some extra CPU cycles\nin order to fit the entire data set into the physical memory\n\(what was not possible with the MySQL in-memory engine results of these experiments are depicted in Figure 6 for\nexecution time per device.\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nExecution time per device for different sets in MonetDB\nGroup size\nEx\ne\ncu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne npe\nr d\nev\nic\ne \n[m\ns]\nMonetDB \(A B MonetDB\nThe performance of the MonetDB was much better when\ncompared to the in-memory performance of the row-based\nMySQL.

For both sets a\nfast convergence rate can be seen for group sizes greater than\n1000 while the performance for the group sizes less then\n1000 had a certain drop in performance. It is expected that\nthe performance improvement rate is actually the software\noverhead, also being affected by the decompression time \(as\ndiscussed in section III best ones. Obviously, the in-memory engine performed\nfar better than InnoDB, thus it was selected for the overall\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n1.\n0\n1.\n5\n2.\n0\n2.\n5\nExecution time per device for pre?interpolated data MySQL vs MonetDB\nGroup size\nEx\ne\ncu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne \npe\nr d\nev\nic\ne \n[m\ns]\nMySQL InMemory \(A A B is depicted in Figure 7. It is evident that the\nMySQL execution time decreases up to a group size of 200\nand 


then starts growing, while the MonetDB execution time\ncontinuously decreases and converges to the execution time\nof less then 1ms per device. We witness that the MySQL in-\nmemory engine exceeds the MonetDB performance for smaller\ngroup sizes, but limited only to the reduced pre-interpolated set\nA?. However, even though the MonetDB resulted in expensive\nexecution times for smaller groups, it performs significantly\nfaster for bigger group. For future industrial and business\napplications exactly these large groups are the main point of\ninterest, and hence constitute our main focus.\nC. Overall Comparison\nThe experiments conducted for both defined scenarios de-\npict how the aggregation performance is affected by the vari-\nous storage technologies as well as the potential pre-processing\nof data such as the pre-interpolation. The analysis of the\nexperiments revealed that pre-interpolation of data has sig-\nnificant impact on the performance boost. The column based\nDBMS \(MonetDB traditional\nDBMS \(MySQL engine over per-\nformed MonetDB for smaller groups, while MonetDB showed\ncontinuous improve even after over performing MySQL.\nTo get a better understanding of the performance benefit of\nboth solutions, the total execution time needs to be compared\nfrom the best of breed DBMS cases.

Depending on the performance requirements\nand data, one can select configurations that fit the business\nobjectives. Hence for a highly limited environment, one needs\nto consider the performance limitations if the interpolation\nis executed at runtime. However, if high performance is\nrequired, one should focus on the pre-interpolated data sets as\nthese assist towards removing the performance penalty \(time for the interpolation step. Pre-interpolation of data\nsets can be scheduled more flexibly for historical data e.g.\nwhenever server capacity allows it Additionally even in real-\ntime, one could consider other aspects such as parallelization\nof pre-interpolation as well as processing of the data which\ncould yell higher performance.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have demonstrated the performance aspects of time se-\nries aggregation by using a traditional row-based DB \(MySQL in-memory-column based approach \(MonetDB superiority\nof the in-memory column based approach. We also propose to\npre-interpolate data \(if possible high performance, since\nthe execution times may be better e.g. 60-fold as indicatively\nshown in the experiments depicted in this work.\nThe vision of integrating real-time analytics into modern\napplications such as a smart city energy cockpit, clearly\npoints out to the need of being able to do high-performance\nprocessing of energy related data. Similar cases could be made\nfor more industrial scenarios such as energy analytics within a\nfactory [8]. Apart from the steps on grouping and interpolation\nthat we have described here, other aspects need also to be\nconsidered such as the guarantee of a high quality dataset.\nThe latter implies checks for data consistency, validation\nagainst domain-specific rules, potential transformations etc.\nall of which may need to be made on-the-fly as data gets\nstreamed into the enterprise systems. To this end, we will\nexpect to further work in the future towards integrating real-\ntime analytics in smart city applications and evaluating them\nunder real conditions. The latter due to increasing privacy,\nsecurity and business concerns may imply to also experiment\nwith encrypted queries [15] and assess their usage in massive-\ndata real-time analytics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank for their support the\nEuropean Commission, and the partners of the EU FP7\nprojects SmartKYE \(www.SmartKYE.eu www.\nict-nobel.eu discussions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] X.

Before we continue with the\nevaluation of UNI-ALIGN, we present in Table III the runtime\nand accuracy of all the variants of BIG-ALIGN for aligning\nmovie-genre graphs with varying sizes and permutations with\nnoise level 10%. The parameters used in this experiment\nare  = 10?5, and ? = 0.1. For BIG-ALIGN-Basic, ? is\nconstant and equal to 10?4, while the correspondence matrices\nare initialized uniformly. This is not the best setting for all\nthe pairs of graphs that we are aligning, and it results in\nvery low accuracy. On the other hand, BIG-ALIGN-Skip is\nnot only 350× faster than BIG-ALIGN-Points, but also\nmore accurate. Moreover, it is ? 2× faster than BIG-ALIGN-\nExact with higher or equal accuracy. The speedup can be\nfurther increased by skipping more updates of the gradient\ndescent steps. Overall, the results show that a naive solution\nof the optimization problem, such as BIG-ALIGN-Basic, is not\nsuf?cient, and the optimizations we propose in Section III are\ncrucial and render our algorithm ef?cient.\nC. Evaluation of UNI-ALIGN\nTo evaluate our proposed method, UNI-ALIGN, for aligning\nunipartite graphs, we use the Facebook who-links-to-whom\ngraph [25], which consists of approximately 64K nodes. In this\ncase, the baseline approaches are readily employed, while our\nmethod requires the conversion of the given unipartite graph\nto bipartite. We do so by extracting some unweighted egonet4\nfeatures for each node \(degree of node, degree of egonet5,\nedges of egonet, mean degree of the node’s neighbors As\nbefore, from the initial graph we extract subgraphs of size\n4As a reminder, egonet of a node is the induced subgraph of its neighbors.\n5The degree of an egonet is de?ned as the number of incoming and outgoing\nedges of the subgraph, when viewed as a super-node.\n\(a Higher and left is better runtime\n\(in seconds / logscale small markers medium markers big markers b Lower is better in seconds scale.\nFig. 6: Accuracy and runtime of alignment of unipartite graphs. \(a red points accurate and faster than all the\nbaselines for all graph sizes. \(c red squares the baseline approaches, followed closely by Umeyama’s\napproach \(green circles or equivalently, 264-6K edges per noise level accuracy vs. runtime plot in Fig. 6\(a

Among the suggested approaches\nare genetic, spectral, clustering algorithms [20 decision trees,\nexpecation-maximization [16], graph edit distance [21], sim-\nplex [2], non-linear optimization 12], iterative HITS-inspired\n[5][28]. Notice that all these works are designed for unipartite\ngraphs, while we focus on bipartite graphs.\nOne of the well-known approaches is Umeyama’s near-\noptimum solution for nearly-isomorphic graphs [24]. The\nmethod solves the optimization problem minP||PAPT ?B||\n\(where P is permutation matrix weighted\ngraphs with the same number of nodes. The Hungarian al-\ngorithm [19] is employed at the end to ?nd the node corre-\nspondences. The constraint that P is doubly stochastic matrix\nis imposed in [26] and [29 where the proposed formulation,\nPATH, is based on convex and concave relaxations. Ding et al\n[10] recently proposed a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization\n\(NMF applies an iterative algorithm to ?nd the orthogonal matrix\nP with the node correspondences.\nBradde et al. [7 propose distributed, heuristic, message-\npassing algorithms, based on Belief Propagation [27], for\nprotein alignment and prediction of interacting proteins. In-\ndependently, Bayati et al [3] formulate graph matching as an\ninteger quadratic problem, and also propose message pass-\ning algorithms for aligning sparse networks. A sparse and\nweighted bipartite graph, whose edges represent the possible\nnode matchings between the two graphs is required by these\nalgorihms. The use of the full bipartite graph was proposed\nearlier by Singh et al 22].\nIn all these works, the graphs that are studied are unipartite,\nwhile we focus on bipartite graphs, and also propose an\nextension of our method to handle unipartite graphs.\nVII. DISCUSSION\nThe experiments show that BIG-ALIGN solves ef?ciently a\nproblem that has been neglected in the literature: the alignment\nof bipartite graphs.\nGiven that all the efforts have been targeted at aligning uni-\npartite graphs, why matching bipartite graphs deserves being\nstudied separately? Firstly, bipartite networks are omnipresent:\npeople like webpages belong to online communities, access\nshared ?les in companies, post in blogs, co-author papers,\nattend conferences etc. All these settings can be modeled\nas bipartite graphs. Secondly, although it is possible to turn\nthem to unipartite and apply an off-the-shelf algorithm, as\nshown in the experiments, knowledge of the speci?c structural\ncharacteristics can prove useful in achieving better quality\nalignments. Lastly, this problem enables emerging applica-\ntions. For instance, one may be able to link the clustering\nresults from different networks by applying soft clustering on\nthe input graphs, and subsequently our method on the obtained\nnode-cluster membership graphs.\nAlthough the main focus of our paper is bipartite graph\nalignment the latter inspires an alternative way of matching\nunipartite graphs, by turning them to bipartite. Therefore we\nshow how our framework can handle any type of input graphs,\nwithout any restrictions on its structure.\nFinally, is our approach simply gradient descent? The\nanswer is negative; gradient descend is the core of our algo-\nrithm, but the projection technique, appropriate initialization\nand choice of the gradient step, as well as careful handling\nof known graph properties are the critical design choices that\nmake our algorithm successful \(as shown in Sec. V, where we\ncompare our method to simple gradient descend BIG-ALIGN-\nBasic class of real graphs, bipartite graphs. Our\ncontributions can be summarized as follows:\n1 introduce a powerful primitive with\nnew constraints for the graph matching problem.\n2 an effective and ef?cient algo-\nrithm, BIG-ALIGN, based on gradient descent \(APGD optimization problem with careful\nhandling of many subtleties. We also give a generalization\nof our approach to align unipartite graphs \(UNI-ALIGN 


UNI-ALIGN are superior to state-of-the-art\ngraph matching algorithms in terms of both accuracy and\nef?ciency for bipartite as well as unipartite graphs.\nFuture work includes extending our problem formulation\nto subgraph matching by revisiting the initialization of the\ncorrespondence matrices.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis material is partially supported by the National Science Foundation\nunder Grant No. IIS1017415 and IIS-1217559, the Army Research Laboratory\nunder Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-09-2-0053, and Defense Ad-\nvanced Research Projects Agency \(DARPA information in this\ndocument does not necessarily re?ect the position or the policy of the Govern-\nment, and no of?cial endorsement should be inferred.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
