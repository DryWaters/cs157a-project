Abstract 
MapReduce has become quite popular to analyse very large datasets Nevertheless users typically have to run their MapReduce jobs over the whole dataset every time the dataset is appended by new records Some researchers have proposed to reuse the intermediate data produced by previous 
MapReduce jobs However existing works still have to read the whole dataset in order to identify which parts of the dataset changed Furthermore storing intermediate results is not suitable in some cases because it can lead to a very high storage overhead In this paper we propose Itchy a MapReduce-based system that employes a set of di

erent techniques to e ciently deal with growing datasets Itchy uses an optimizer to automatically choose the right technique to process a MapReduce job The beauty of Itchy is that it does not have to read the whole dataset again to deal with new records In more detail Itchy keeps track of the provenance of intermediate results in order to selectively recompute intermediate results as required But if intermediate results are small or the computational cost of map functions is high Itchy can automatically start storing intermediate results rather than the provenance information Additionally Itchy also supports the option of directly merging outputs from several jobs

ferent approaches for processing incremental-jobs Therefore in contrast to previous works Itchy provides an optimiser to automatically choose the best technique for performing each incoming MapReduce job For MapReduce jobs producing large-size intermediate results or having map functions that are not CPU intensive Itchy stores a mapping from intermediate keys to input records in the form of QMCs However in contrast to RAFT that stores QMCs at a map task level for failover purposes Itchy stores QMCs at a intermediate key level Hence Itchy can recompute a given individual record independently of the map task that originally processed the individual record Still the QMCs might be larger than intermediate results themselves Thus for MapReduce jobs producing very small-size intermediate results or having CPU intensive map functions Itchy stores intermediate results This is di erent from the memoization approaches presented in 16 in that we k eep track of intermediate results at the intermediate-key level rather than at the task level This allows Itchy to use these intermediate results even though the input to the task has changed Itchy can also decide to not store any additional information regarding intermediate results in cases that MapReduce jobs allow for merging nal outputs For example consider a MapReduce job computing the total revenue of selling a given product In this case Itchy can merge the nal outputs of the rst-job and an incremental-job As a result Itchy does not have to process again any record in the map phase or intermediate results in the reduce phase The idea behind Itchy triggers many interesting challenges when running a rst-job and an incremental-job Which di erent kinds of QMCs can be used for improving MapReduce jobs over growing datasets What is the tradeo between storing QMCs and intermediate results How can we e ciently store QMCs or intermediate results during the rst-job without any changes to users jobs How can we e ciently utilize QMCs or intermediate results to recompute only some records of the table How can we do so with only minimal changes to users How can we e ciently merge the outputs of the rst-job and the incremental-job We present Itchy a framework to e ciently deal with growing datasets The main goal of Itchy is to execute incrementaljobs by processing only relevant parts from the input of the rst-job e.g the table together with the input of incremental-jobs e.g the table In summary we make the following main contributions We propose three di erent techniques to e ciently process incremental-jobs namely Itchy QMC which stores provenance information Itchy MO which stores the Map Output hence intermediate data and Itchy Merge which combines the output of MapReduce jobs We show that deciding between Itchy QMC and Itchy MO is basically a tradeo between storage overhead and runtime overhead Thus we present a decision model that allows Itchy to automatically balance the usage of QMCs and intermediate data to improve query performance Thereby Itchy can decide the best option for each incoming MapReduce job considering both job runtime and storage overhead We present a framework that implements the Itchy ideas in an invisible way to users including many non-trivial performance optimizations to process incremental-jobs e ciently We present an extensive experimental evaluation of Itchy against Hadoop MapReduce framework and Incoop Our results demonstrate that Itchy signiìcantly outperforms both Hadoop MapReduce and Incoop when dealing with incremental-jobs We also show that Itchy incurs only negligible overhead when processing the rst-job II R W MapReduce was originally proposed by Google for building their inverted search index Ho we v er  Google f aced problems with the incremental nature of their web index and hence moved on to Percolator Percolator operates on top of BigTable and has departed from the idea of MapReduce Most other works such as Incoop and DryadInc 16 propose the idea of memoization Here the idea is to cache outputs of map and reduce tasks These cached intermediate results can be returned when the same task is later run over the same input However these two approaches has to read the entire dataset every time the dataset changes in order to identify the parts of the dataset that changed DryadINC additionally proposes the idea of similar to the idea of Itchy Merge However in contrast to DryadINC Itchy Merge works on output stored in standard HDFS Another approach is Restore which considers w orkîows of several MapReduce jobs as produced by highlevel languages e.g Pig Restore persists the outputs of individual jobs in such a workîow and can reuse these outputs for later jobs in cases where the physical plans match However a previous plan and therefore its stored output is only considered a match for a new plan if both input datasets are unchanged Hence it is not applicable to Aliceês problem of growing datasets Ramp considers the related problem of  Here the focus is on a particular output record In other words given some changed input data how can we update this single output tuple e ciently Itchy focuses on a di erent problem  Ikeda et al also e xplore the concepts of pro v enance in MapReduce similarly to Itchy and measure the overhead for capturing provenance However they do not apply the concept to the idea of incremental computation CBP implements incremental bulk processing on top of MapReduce by considering stateful grouping operators Nevertheless users has to decide and specify which state should be persisted and used

One can view the result of a MapReduce job as a materialized view on the input data Therefore we also consider the literature on relational incremental materialized view maintenance 3 Here the problem is slightly di erent usually the materialized views are speciìed by declarative SQL queries Hence the semantics of queries are known and used for view maintenance This is not the case for MapReduce where queries are usually speciìed by black box map and reduce functions Still some of the ideas of relational incremental materialized view maintenance could be applied when working with high-level query languages on top of MapReduce such as HiveQL or PigLatin 11 III H M R R Since Itchy is based on Hadoop MapReduce we discuss the Hadoop MapReduce workîow in more detail Let us look in detail at what happens when Alice executes her MapReduce job  Before starting her MapReduce job Alice uploads the SALES table i.e Table I a into HDFS Once her dataset is uploaded to HDFS Alice can execute JobAVG using Hadoop MapReduce In turn Hadoop MapReduce executes JobAVG in three main phases the  the  and the  During the Map Phase Hadoop MapReduce rst partitions the input dataset into smaller horizontal partitions called  Typically an input split correspond to an HDFS block Then the Hadoop MapReduce scheduler is responsible of allocating a map task for each input split to available computing nodes Once a map task is allocated the map task uses a to parse its input split into key-value pairs For Aliceês MapReduce job the RecordReader produces key-value pairs in the form for each line of input data The map task then executes a map-call for each of key-value pair independently The output of a map-call might be zero or more intermediate key-value pairs For Aliceês MapReduce job the map output is in the form  During the Shu e Phase Hadoop MapReduce partitions the intermediate keyvalue pairs by intermediate key and assigns each partition to a di erent reduce task This means that the intermediate results produced by all map tasks that have the same intermediate key will end up in the same reduce task Then during the Reduce Phase the reduce task executes a reduce-call for each group of intermediate key-value pairs The output of a reduce-call might be zero or more nal key-value pairs Finally Hadoop MapReduce stores the output of reduce tasks in HDFS IV I In this section we present the ideas for e cient incremental processing in Itchy Incremental TeCHniques for Yellow elephants In the following we rst discuss the two standard techniques Itchy uses for incremental-jobs and  Then we present how Itchy supports merging di erent outputs for incremental-jobs Since Itchy can use all these three techniques for processing incremental-jobs we thus discuss the tradeo s among them Based on these observations we present a model that allows Itchy to automatically decide which of the three techniques to use for a given incoming MapReduce job Aliceês problem is that using Hadoop she has to reprocess the entire terabyte-sized table each time she appends a few records To address this issue Itchy exploits the fact that relevant records in the table can be identiìed by the intermediate key they produce Indeed records in the table are only relevant to an incremental-job if they produce an intermediate key that is also produced by some appended record Therefore Itchy rst processes the appended records using the provided map function This allows Itchy to obtain the set of intermediate keys produced by the appended records Then Itchy uses a mapping from each intermediate key to o sets in the input to the rst-job i.e  o sets   in order to identify those records that are relevant to the newly appended records Let us rst see how Itchy collects the QMC mapping when running the rst-job First Itchy processes the table using the userdeìned map function as in standard Hadoop MapReduce At this point Itchy stores a QMC mapping for each intermediate key  which for JobAvg looks as follows   1  2  3  4  5   Then as in Hadoop MapReduce Itchy processes the intermediate results using the user-deìned reduce function Now let us detail how Itchy processes the appended records in the table incremental-job Figure 1 shows how Itchy processes an incoming incremental-job Notice that Itchy uses the QMC s for identifying the relevant records in  Thus as a rst step Itchy executes the userdeìned map function over the additional records in and computes the set of relevant intermediate keys IK 1 In our example the map output when processing only the records in Sales MO is   3   6  and IK is   Then Itchy retrieves the associated o sets from the QMC for each intermediate key in IK 2  Notice that the intermediate key IK is not part of QMC  because is not produced by any record in  In contrast the record 132  2 in the table produces the intermediate key  which is in IK  Therefore Itchy retrieves only the relevant o set  3  from QMC  This means that Itchy additionally has to process the record at position 3 in the table

Itchy processes this relevant record 132 2 using again the user-deìned map function and produces one map output from the original table MO  2 3 Notice that Itchy post-ìlters the MO output so as to consider only relevant intermediate keys in the reduce phase as the user-deìned map function might produce several intermediate keys for a single record At this point we already have all the intermediate results required for the correct result Thus Itchy just has to execute the user-deìned reduce function over MO MO  3  6  2 4  As a result the reduce phase yields the correct di erential output  3  4  As discussed in the previous section Itchy QMC recomputes some records from the table when processing incremental-jobs This is not suitable for jobs having expensive map functions An alternative solution for these cases is to store the intermediate values directly instead of the o sets The set of all mappings from intermediate keys to intermediate values is the map output MO itself i.e  In our running example the map output contains the following values for the table MO  4 6   2   9 9   Then when processing the appended records in  Itchy retrieves the required intermediate values from MO  Like Itchy QMC Itchy MO rst computes the output of the map phase for the records in  i.e  3  6 line 2 Next Itchy retrieves the relevant intermediate values from MO  previously computed by the rst-job Recall that the intermediate key was not produced by any record in  Thus Itchy MO only retrieves the intermediate value  2 from MO and add it to MO  After this operation MO is equal to  2  Then Itchy can execute the user-deìned reduce function over the MO MO  3  6  2  As a result Itchy again yields the correct di erential output  3  4  It is worth noticing that Itchy stores the intermediate results based on the intermediate keys In contrast other works such as Incoop perform map task memoization which means that they store the map task output and retrieve it based on the input split i.e input to the map task Memoization requires all tasks from incremental-jobs to have exactly the same input as previous tasks from the rst-job to be able to reuse previously computed results Itchy can selectively reuse parts of the previously computed results having the required intermediate keys Let us now focus on how Itchy deals with jobs where users specify a Merge function Note that is not suitable for merging as we cannot compute the average of independently computed averages without additional information Therefore we instead consider the following query   Here Itchy can merge the output from processing only the appended records with the output of the rst-job using a user-deìned For  this merge function simply adds for each intermediate key the results in the di erential output with the results in the base output One problem here is to identify the parts in the base output to merge with while processing the appended records Therefore Itchy stores some extra information  s to identify the relevant parts in the base output QMC is a mapping from intermediate keys to o sets in the base output i.e o sets  When running for the rst time i.e the rst-job Itchy rst computes the base output as normal Hadoop and persists the QMC information when writing the base output to HDFS Figure 2 shows Itchyês workîow when processing the appended records in incremental-job First Itchy again uses the user-deìned map 1 and reduce 2 functions to obtain the temporary output Next for each intermediate key in MO  Itchy retrieves the o set of the output record that was produced by the same intermediate key 3 For example consider the intermediate key in the incrementaljob As the intermediate key also occurred during the rstjob Itchy retrieves the entry  2 from QMC  Next Itchy directly retrieves the record  2 at the relevant o sets  2 in the base output 4  Itchy then uses the user-deìned merge function to merge the retrieved records from the base output and the temporary output 5  In our example the merge function receives the record  2 from the base output and the records  3 and  6 from the temporary output as input The merge function then computes the sum outputs the merged output records  3 and  8 in a di erential le At this point the reader might have one natural question in mind As Itchy Merge requires a user-deìned merge function let us rst look at the main di erences between Itchy QMC and Itchy MO On the one hand Itchy QMC implies that we have to recompute values while Itchy MO allows us to simply retrieve those values On the other hand the intermediate results stored by Itchy MO can become quite large while Itchy QMC only requires storing the intermediate key and an o set of 12 bytes size Thus Itchy has to trade storage overhead with recomputation time One advantage of Itchy QMC is that the storage

 Itchyês Decision Model size overhead remains constant despite the number of attributes in the reduce phase i.e the size of intermediate results Itchy MO stores the actual intermediate data and hence the storage size overhead scales with the number of included attributes The second factor impacting Itchyês tradeo is the time for recomputing relevant records which mainly depends on the average map runtime The longer it takes the map function to process one record the higher is the runtime overhead for recomputing relevant records in Itchy QMC In contrast Itchy MO avoids such recomputation costs by directly retrieving the respective values In contrast to both Itchy QMC and Itchy MO Itchy Merge requires neither to recompute relevant records nor to store intermediate results Thus Itchy Merge seems to be the best option for processing incremental-jobs in cases where the user speciìes a merge function However it is not always possible to provide a merge function e.g for a join query This is the reason why Itchy uses all three techniques and includes a decision model to choose among them Algorithm 1 outlines the decision model used by Itchy Overall Itchy decides to use Itchy Merge whenever users specify a merge function Otherwise Itchy decides between Itchy QMC and Itchy MO based on the measurements average value size average map selectivity and average map runtime Itchy measures these values when processing the rst wave of map tasks So far we discussed the applicability of Itchy to individual single relational queries Naturally the question that arises is In this respect Itchy can process MapReduce jobs having multiple relations without any alterations Itchy MO and Itchy Merge work with the intermediate results or the nal output respectively and hence are not a ected by having multiple input relations Also since Itchy QMC stores a le identiìer along with each o set it can handle multiple input relations Another question that the reader might have is Here Itchy faces the problem that usually in-between-job results are deleted after a job is nished Hence Itchy QMC can only access the input data for the rst job and Itchy Merge can access only the output of the last job In contrast Itchy MO persists the intermediate results for each job Therefore Itchy MO uses the di erential output of a stage as the incremental input to the next stage until it outputs the nal di erential output V I While processing the rst-job Itchy has to store the QMC mappings to HBase for each intermediate key Therefore Itchy QMC concatenates the o sets at the end of the intermediate values during the map phase and utilises the shu e phase to piggy back the o sets on top of the data sent from the map tasks to the reduce tasks When deserializing the intermediate values before calling the reduce function Itchy extracts the o sets from the intermediate values In this way Itchy has all o sets for a given intermediate key and can store them in a single HBase storage operation When processing incremental-jobs Itchy uses the QMC mappings to identify the records in the base input as discussed in Section IV To do so Itchy has to retrieve the relevant o sets from the QMC mappings and then process the appended records together with the relevant records in the base input Itchy processes the appended records and parts of the base input in a single MapReduce job This is challenging as Itchy only knows which parts of the original input it has to process after processing all appended records In the standard Hadoop MapReduce framework all map tasks are scheduled independently and there is no control for such scheduling conditions To deal with this requirement Itchy introduces the concept of  The idea is to assign each map task to a map unit which are then executed in strictly sequential order During the map phase Itchy only schedules those tasks that belong to the current map unit Only after all tasks of a map unit have nished Itchy moves to the next map unit In particular Itchy assigns all map tasks processing the appended records to map unit 1 and all map tasks processing relevant records from the base input to map unit 2 Notice that the concept of map units is independent of the scheduling policy such as the LATE scheduler used by Hadoop as map units are implemented on a per job basis i.e in the JobInProgress class Then when a map task processing the appended records in map unit 1 nishes Itchy looks up the o sets in HBase for the intermediate keys produced by this map task One problem here is that several map tasks can produce the same intermediate key ik  Thus looking up the o sets for all intermediate keys in every map task can lead to a large number of unnecessary HBase lookups To reduce the number of unnecessary HBase calls Itchy caches the set of already seen intermediate keys between several map tasks running in the same JVM Itchy then sorts the retrieved o sets and partitions them into HDFS les according to the blocks of the base input When Itchy starts the second map unit it should schedule only map tasks for those blocks containing at least one relevant o set the other map tasks point to blocks containing only irrelevant records However Hadoop MapReduce and

therefore Itchy as well creates map tasks when initialising a MapReduce job and Itchy does not know the relevant records till it nishes executing all map tasks in map unit 1 Therefore Itchy will unschedule all map tasks that are not required meaning directly marking a map task as nished without executing it For scheduled map tasks in map unit 2 Itchy reads merges and sorts all les containing relevant o sets With this sorted set of o sets the RecordReader of a map task can pass only relevant records to the map function Notice that as a map-call might emit several intermediate keys for one record the map function can emit intermediate keys that are not produced by the appended records These intermediate keys are not required by reduce tasks to produce the correct results In fact these intermediate keys can actually lead to incorrect results for the such intermediate keys Therefore Itchy applies post-ìltering of the not required intermediate keys at the end of each map task in map unit 2 In case of storing map outputs Itchy has to persist the intermediate results while processing the rst-job The intermediate results are grouped and partitioned during the shu e phase by default Thus the only di erence from the standard Hadoop workîow is that Itchy persists intermediate results to HBase before starting each reduce task When processing the incremental-job Itchy uses only the appended records as input Itchy retrieves the required intermediate values just before each reduce-call Notice that each reduce-call is responsible for a single intermediate key Therefore Itchy requires only one HBase query to retrieve the intermediate values per intermediate key Itchy appends the retrieved intermediate values to the intermediate values produced by the appended records The reduce function processes all these intermediate values as in the standard Hadoop MapReduce workîow In contrast to Itchy QMC and Itchy MO Itchy Merge requires users to specify a  Itchy Merge processes the rst-job almost as in the standard MapReduce framework Except at the point where reduce tasks emit the output Itchy additionally persists the QMC mappings to HBase Recall that QMC is a mapping from intermediate key to o set in the output When processing the incremental-job Itchy again behaves as the standard Hadoop MapReduce workîow up to the point where reducers emit the nal output Here Itchy retrieves the o sets in the base output using QMC for each intermediate key Then Itchy reads the corresponding parts from the base output at those o sets Next Itchy merges the retrieved parts of the base output with the just produced temporary output Finally Itchy writes the merged di erential output to HDFS VI E We use a local 10 node cluster where each node has one 2.66GHz Quad Core Xeon processor and 4x4GB of main memory The advantage of running our experiments on this local cluster rather than on the cloud is that the amount of runtime variance is limited We use two di erent datasets data as speciìed in the TPC-H benchmark and dumb les as described by W e generate 300GB of base input and 1GB of incremental input for both datasets We use Hadoop and Incoop 5 as baselines We evaluate Itchy in all its three modes to operate namely Itchy QMC Itchy MO and Itchy Merge where applicable We use two di erent jobs for  The rst job   is similar to Aliceês query while the second job   is based on the rst query of TPC-H Job1 in SQL For the dataset we use the job which is frequently used for benchmarking MapReduce systems  F or all e xperiments we run the jobs three times and report the average The rst thing users have to do to run their MapReduce jobs is to upload their datasets to HDFS In this respect Itchy works in the same way as Hadoop We observed that both Hadoop and Itchy are 1 6 times faster than Incoop when uploading 300GB of data Incoopês overhead is due to the content-wise splitting of input data which minimizes the number of changed input splits in case a small part of the dataset changes Therefore Incoop identiìes certain markers in the input data using Rabin ngerprints and then places the split boundaries at those markers In contrast Hadoop and Itchy generates xed length input splits In this section we measure Itchyês overhead when running the rst-job Figure 3\(a illustrates the execution times for and when processing 300GB of input data As expected we observe that both Itchy and Incoop incur some overhead over the execution time of Hadoop as they have to store additional information In particular we observe that Itchy QMC has an overhead of 29 for and overhead

15 for  We observe that Itchy QMC incurs a higher overhead than Incoop for  but it has a lower overhead for  Also Itchy MO has a lower overhead  10 than Itchy QMC for and a higher overhead  28 for  This is because the intermediate data size for is smaller than the QMC information while the intermediate data size for is bigger Next we observe that Itchy MO has roughly the same performance as Incoop for  but Itchy MO performs slightly slower than Incoop for  The reason is that Itchy MO stores intermediate data at the intermediate key level while Incoop does it at the task level Figure 3\(b shows the execution times for when processing 300GB of base input data On the one hand we observe that Itchy QMC incurs an overhead of 23 over Hadoop but Itchy QMC is slightly faster than Incoop On the other hand we observe that Itchy MO is 1 6 slower than Hadoop and 1 2 slower than Incoop This is because the job produces a large number of intermediate keysItchy Merge performs 1 22 faster than Incoop 1 13 faster than Itchy QMC and 1 5 faster than Itchy MO Still Itchy Merge is slightly slower than Hadoop because it has to store the mapping of intermediate keys to o sets in the output QMC  to HBase We now evaluate the performance of Itchy when performing incremental-jobs For this we append the and datasets with 1GB new data each Notice that for Itchy and Hadoop we only have to upload the 1GB of new records while for Incoop we have to upload a 301GB dataset including all input from the rst-job This is because Incoop can currently handle only a single le as input to a job while Itchy and Hadoop can use several les as input to a job Figure 3\(c shows the results for  We observe that Hadoop performs quite similar as when running the rst-job This is because Hadoop has to reprocess the entire 300GB base input in addition to the 1GB of appended records In contrast Itchy does not have to recompute the entire 300GB base input As a result we observe that Itchy is up to 20 times faster than Hadoop and 10 times faster than Incoop Also we observe that the performance gap between Itchy and both Hadoop and Incoop is higher for as produces larger intermediate data This is also why Itchy QMC also slightly outperforms Itchy MO for  Figure 3\(d illustrates the results for when processing 1GB of new data In these results we plot the results for Itchy Merge as is in the Merge class Again Hadoop reprocess the entire 300GB input to the rst-job in addition to the 1GB appended records As a result Hadoop has a similar performance as when performing the rst-job For Itchy we observe that Itchy QMC and Itchy MO are 4 6 times faster than Hadoop and 1 3 times faster than Incoop However recall that Incoop requires users to upload the entire 301GB of data while Itchy only requires users to upload the 1GB of new records Here the reader can observe that the relative performance di erence between Incoop and Itchy QMC and Itchy MO is not as large as in the benchmark This is because the incremental-job requires many intermediate values to be recomputed as frequent word often occur in a large number of documents In contrast Itchy Merge exploits the fact that performs a sum of frequencies per word to simply add the incremental output with the base output This results in an improvement factor of 41 over Hadoop and of 11 over Incoop Next we study the tradeo between Itchy QMC and Itchy MO Recall that Itchy QMC requires a higher cost for recomputing some records from the rst-job while Itchy MO might require a lot of space for storing the intermediate values For this we alter to include additional attributes in the intermediate values in order to vary the intermediate value size Figure 4\(a shows the results for the rst-job when varying the intermediate value size We observe that the job runtime for both Hadoop and Itchy QMC does not increase by much when

increasing the intermediate value size In contrast Itchy MO incurs a 25 increase in runtime from projecting 2 attributes to projecting 10 attributes This is because Itchy MO cost for storing the MO mappings strongly depends on the of intermediate values while Itchy QMC cost for storing the QMC mappings is independent of the intermediate value size Figure 4\(b shows the results for the incremental-job when varying the intermediate value size Here we observe that the job runtime for all three systems does not vary much This is because the number of intermediate values is far less than for the rst-job Next we consider the other part of the tradeo  i.e the storage overhead Recall that both systems have to store additional information while Itchy QMC stores QMC mappings Itchy MO stores the intermediate results Figure 4\(c illustrates the storage overhead incurred by both systems when varying again the size of intermediate values As expected we observe that the overhead incurred by Itchy QMC does not vary with respect to intermediate value size This is because Itchy QMC stores o sets and hence the QMC storage does only depend on the number of intermediate keys and not on the size of intermediate values In contrast Itchy MO stores the intermediate values directly and hence we can see the storage size for MO increase when including additional attributes in the intermediate values Notice that for 2 attributes the storage size for Itchy QMC is actually larger than for Itchy MO This is due the fact that Itchy QMC has to store the lename identiìer and o set which is larger than the size of the two attributes Itchy MO has to store as intermediate value However as soon as start to project more attributes the overhead incurred by Itchy MO starts getting larger than Itchy QMC Let us now consider how well the Itchyês decision model deals with the di erent benchmarks For we observe that the average intermediate value size is as large as the size for storing a QMC mapping Therefore the decision model decides to use Itchy MO as for the same storage requirements it expects a better performance for the incremental-job As we can see from Figure 3\(c this assumption holds true For  we see that the average intermediate value size is much larger as it contains more and larger attributes In such case the decision model considers the ratio  Again we observe in Figure 3\(c that this decision holds true Since this ratio is above the given threshold Itchy decides to use the Itchy QMC technique For the job Itchy decides to use Itchy Merge as the user has deìned a merge UDF From Figure 3\(d we observe that this decision allows Itchy Merge to signiìcantly outperform not only Hadoop and Incoop but also Itchy QMC and Itchy MO VII C Many current applications produce large amounts of data in a daily basis that has to be analysed as new data arrive In this paper we presented Itchy   for supporting MapReduce jobs over growing datasets As we identiìed that di erent MapReduce jobs require di erent approaches to deal with incremental datasets Itchy contains a suite of three di erent techniques Itchy QMC Itchy MO and Itchy Merge We presented a cost-based decision model that allows Itchy to automatically chooses the right technique between those three technique for each MapReduce Job We evaluated Itchy using two di erent benchmarks and compared it with Hadoop the most popular MapReduce framework and Incoop a state-of-the-art system to deal with incremental datasets The results show the superiority of Itchy for processing incremental jobs Itchy runs up to 20 times faster than Hadoop and up to 10 times faster than Incoop In cases where users can specify a merge function Itchy can improve the performance up to a factor of 41 compared to Hadoop up to a factor of 11 compared to Incoop A series of additional experiments also showed the high e ectiveness of the Itchy decision model We would like to thank the authors of Incoop for providing us access to their prototype R

insights and techniques of data-mining and visualization on a qualitative research tool that operates at multiple scales from the narrative analysis of a single interview to large datasets of thousands of hours of audio or video recorded interviews This visualization tool has the great potential to enhance the capacity of the researcher to make-sense of these wider patterns and connections Human rights researchers analyze the relevant data of various sorts format e.g textual audio and video and conduct both qualitative and quantitative content analysis With the increasingly available data sets about human rights violation and their growing sizes navigating and analyzing such large scale data collections is more and more challenging Our work presents a concept of proof of combining text mining and information visualization techniques to address this challenge We anticipate the growing importance of such visual analytic tools that help users conveniently navigate to their on-demanded information and manipulate data and that facilitate users to analyze the large scale data collection through multiple views and interactive features There is no similar tool in use within the eld of oral history With our speciìc CKM design we expect that it is applicable to different kinds of time-series sequential data stream A CKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Kim Moore and Eve-Lyne Cayouette Ashby who participated in the rst design presentation meeting as regular users and maintainers of Stories Matter database They provided valuable feedback on our design ideas This project is funded by SSHRC Digging into Data challenge grant R EFERENCES  D bo yd and K Cra wford Six pro v ocations for big data  i n A Decade in Internet Time Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society  2011  D Fisher  R  Deline M Czerwinski and S Druck er  Inter actions with big data analytics vol 19 no 3 pp 50Ö59 2012  D Rotman Y  He J Preece and A Druin Understanding large scale online environments with qualitative methods in 2013 iConference  2013  T  He y  S T ansle y  and K T olle The Fourth Paradigm DataIntensive Scientiìc Discovery  Microsoft Research 2009  J Heer and S Kandel Interacti v e analysis of big data  vol 19 no 1 pp 50Ö54 2012  S Kandel A P a epck e J Hellerstein and J Heer  Enterprise data analysis and visualization An interview study vol 18 no 12 pp 2917Ö2926 2012  S Knudsen M R Jak obsen and K HornbÊk  A n e xploratory study of how abundant display space may support data analysis in the 7th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction Making Sense Through Design  2012  J Li vnat and Y  Zhang Information interpretation or infor mation discovery Which role of analysts do investors value more vol 13 no 3 pp 612Ö641 2012  A Sri v asta v a and M Sahami Text Mining Classiìcation Clustering and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2009  I H W itten G W  P aynter  E  Frank C Gutwin and C G Nevill-Manning Kea Practical automatic keyphrase extraction in The 4th ACM Conference On Digital Libraries  1999  C Zhang  Automatic k e yw ord e xtraction from documents using conditional random elds vol 4 no 3 pp 1169 1180 2008  Y  nung Chen Y  Huang H yi Lee and L shan Lee Unsupervised two-stage keyword extraction from spoken documents by topic coherence and support vector machine in The 37th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing  2012  H.-L Ong A.-H T an J N Lee H P an and Q.-X Li Foci  Flexible organizer for competitive intelligence in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  2001  C Jacquemin H F olch and S Nugier  Ocean 2 1/2d interactive visual data mining of text documents in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization  2006  C H K u  J  H  Nguyen and G Lero y  T asc crime report visualization for investigative analysis A case study in The 10th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration  2012  W  Cui S Liu L T an C Shi Y  Song Z Gao X T ong and H Qu Textîow towards better understanding of evolving topics in text vol 17 no 21 2001  H Greenspan On Listening to Holocaust Survivors Recounting and Life History  Westport Praeger 2010  M Frisch Three dimensions and more Oral history be yond the paradoxes of method pp 221Ö222 2008  S High M Jessica and S Zembrzycki T elling our stories/animating our past A status report on oral history and new media vol 37 no 3 pp 1Ö22 2012  S High and D Sw orn  After the intervie w The interpreti v e challenges of oral history video indexing vol 1 no 2 2009  K Schaf fer and S Smith Human Rights and Narrated Lives:The Ethics of Recognition  New York and Basingstoke Palgrave Macmillan 2004  E Jessee S Zembrzycki and S High Stories matter Conceptual challenges in the development of oral history database building software vol 12 no 1 2010  L G Shapiro and G C Stockman Computer Vision  Prentice Hall 2001 112
