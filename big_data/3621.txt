This paper introduces the related studies of alarms association and sequential pattern mining describes the features of network management alarms presents a method of mining correlation rules of network management alarms by sequence clustering algorithm. The experiments show that many interesting correlation rules could be acquired efficiently Furthermore, these rules could be used to guide the intelligent network alarms filtering and fault location   1. Introduction  With the growing size of the communication networks, the rapid growth of the network bandwidth and speed, the network faults are inevitable. The network management software produces a lot of data about network performances, network alarms and so on every day. When a single fault or invalidation happens in the network, a large number of alarm information may be produced, although the alarm information can help the network managers quickly and accurately location the fault, a large number of alarm information will also affect the fault location judgment and managers’ reaction speed. In a sense, we do not lack the information at present, but are submerged by the information. Introducing data mining technology into the network management system is an important development direction of intelligence network management system Sequential pattern mining is an important subject of data mining, a further promotion of correlation rules mining, and it is also widely applied. This paper analyses some shortcomings of the traditional algorithm by the research of traditional sequential pattern mining algorithm's principle, presents the method of mining correlation rules by sequence clustering algorithm. On this basis, establishes network management alarms correlation mining model, we can mine a lot of meaningful alarms correlation rules by this model  2. Basic concepts  2.1. Alarms correlation 000\003  Definition 1 \(Alarms and alarms sequence An “alarm” is a notification of a specific event and like an abnormally or may not lead in defects, an alarm may or may not represent an error. The sequence are composed of a number of alarms is called alarms sequence, it have very strong relevance of the time Definition 2 \(Alarms correlation Alarms correlation is the analysis of alarms correlation, the process of alarms’ compression and conversion, substitutes a number of alarms for a more informative alarm. The main functions are as follows 1\larms compression [A,A,…,A 001 A: In compression phase, alarms are received in a time window and multiple occurrences of the same event substituting the corresponding alarms for a single alarm 2\larms filtering [A,B,C 001 A: Delete the alarms which fall short of the alarms correlation 3\larms count [n×A 001 B: The substitution of a specified number of occurrences of an alarm, with a new alarm

4\larms suppression [B,A, priority\(A priority\(B B: Suppression is a temporary inhibition of alarms referring to a given event, according to criteria \(continuously evaluated by the correlation system\he dynamic context of the network management process [1   5\larms time sequence relationship: The different alarms are reported according to a certain kind of time sequence  2.2. Sequential pattern mining  Definition 1 \(Sequence An itemset is a non-empty set of items. A sequence is an ordered list of itemsets [2 ith o u t lo ss o f  generality, we assume that the set of items is mapped to a set of contiguous integers. We denote an itemset i by {i1, i2, …, ij, …, im}, where i, is an item. We denote a sequence s by \(s1, s2 ..., sj, ..., sn\here s is an itemset. We denote a sequence by  1 2 j  m\, where j is an event. The length of a sequence is defined as the number of itemsets which are contained in the sequence, writing  j j l    Definition 2 \(Subsequence Let  be two sequences. If there is an isotonic mapping which can map the events of to the events of we say that is a subsequence of namely  contains writing   Definition 3 \(The support for the sequence Let be a sequence of database D, the support for the sequence is defined as the fraction of total sequences of database D who support this sequence Definition 4 \(Large sequence A sequence with minimum support is called a large sequence. Note that each sequence in a large sequence must have minimum support. Hence, any large sequence must be a list of itemsets Definition 5 \(Episode An episode is a pair V here V is a collection of alarm predicates, and is a partial order on V Given a sequence of alarms S, an episode V  occurs within S if there is a way of satisfying the alarm predicates in V using the alarms of S so that the partial order is respected Definition 6 \(Episode rules Let  be two episodes, the implication   denotes the relationship of them. We define confidence as strength of implication relationship, writing conf=fr S\fr S\o we define episode rules as the implication relationship of two large episodes which with minimum confidence \(minConf\writing   The knowledge we finally submit to the users is episode rules Definition 7 \(Window An alarms sequence in the alarms sequence S writing W\(w,ts,te\and the window W is composed of all of the alarms\(A,t\which meet the request\(ts t te\he width of the window W is defined as te-ts  3. WINEPI algorithm  There is a vast set of methods used to alarms correlation, Agrawal, etc. first present the issue of sequential pattern mining [2 o st seq u e n tial p a tter n  mining algorithms are based on Apriori, so we call them Aprior like algorithms, such as WINEPI, GSP  etc.; another kind of algorithm is the growing technology of sequential pattern which is based on database projection, like FP growing method. The research of algorithms in this paper is based on the former  Figure 1 Process of WINEPI  Because of the timing characteristics of alarms data the episode rules mining is generally based on sequential pattern mining algorithm. WINEPI algorithm is the basic method of episode rules mining Figure 2 illustrates its specific process, and the letters indicate the different types of alarms. The sliding time window with a length of w slides by unit step length from the initial moment of sequence S to the end, a set of windows W\(S, w\ is formed in this process. In order to enable the moment of alarm to be independent of the probability of that it is contained by windows, we stipulate that the first window Ws include and only include the first alarm of sequence, and the last window We include and only include the last alarm of sequence For any episode we define its support in sequence S fr S      W    WWSw fr S WSw      In the formula, |W\(S, w\| is the number of windows in W\(S, w\, according to referen e ca n eas i l y  know that 1 es TT w  is total time of sliding, let sliding step-length\(step\e unit time 1, then the number of windows in W\(S, w\is as follow  1 es WSw T T w   
983 


From the above analysis we can see that, the number of windows is total time of sliding, but, in fact after the actual analysis of alarms sequence data, we see that the alarms are not in a row, and the time of interval between the two neighboring alarms may be very long. Thus, when the window slides by unit step length, a lot of empty windows \(the window without alarm\ will inevitably be produced, especially when a large amount of data is needed to process, the number of these windows must be very large. These windows are called noneffective windows in the analysis, and they will occupy a lot of resources  4. Sequence clustering algorithm  4.1. Sequence clustering algorithm principles  Sequence clustering works by merging two technologies, clustering and sequence analysis. It is designed to analyze a population of cases that contains sequence data and group those cases into more or less homogeneous segments based on the similarity of those sequences. While the clustering is similar to the others, the sequence analysis is something new—a Markov Chain model \(Figure 2  Figure 2 Markov Chain model  Based on the Markov chain, for any given length L sequence x{x1, x2, x3, ..., xL}, we can calculate the probability of a sequence as follows 11 11 1          LL LL Px Px x x P xx x Px      The Sequence Clustering algorithm learns a mixture of Markov chains, where each mixture component corresponds to a particular cluster. A single case is generated from a mixture model as follows. First, a particular component \(cluster\ randomly selected using a probability distribution over the clusters Second, depending on which cluster is selected, a sequence is generated from the Markov chain corresponding to that cluster \(each cluster or component corresponds to a different Markov chain  4.2. Sequence clustering algorithm process  Sequence Clustering algorithm depends on expectation maximization EM\.The EM algorithm uses a probabilistic measure, rather than a strict distance measure, to determine which objects belong to which clusters. Instead of choosing a point for each dimension and computing a distance, the EM algorithm considers a bell curve for each dimension, with a mean and standard deviation. As a point falls within the bell curve, it is assigned to a cluster with a certain probability. EM is an iterative algorithm that finds parameters corresponding to local optima for a model—parameters that locally maximize the likelihood of the data The overall process of the sequence clustering algorithm is 1\itialize the model parameters somehow \(e.g., at random 2\en a current model parameters, each case is assigned to each of the K clusters with some probability. This is the E step 3\evaluate the model parameters based on the weighed assignment of each case. This is the M step 4\heck whether the model has converged. If not go to step 2 for a new iteration  Figure 3 The process of Sequence Clustering algorithm Sequence Clustering algorithm processes the data according to the sequence order, because the sequences are in different size, of sliding window automatically changes with the size of sequence, Figure 3 illustrates its process. This method can avoid the production of a large number of noneffective windows, slides by window step length, saves resources and improves the resources utilization greatly  5. Alarms correlation analysis model  Based on the above algorithm and combined with mature alarms correlation processing technology, I designed a new alarms correlation analysis model Figure 4 illustrates it 1\TL ETL \(Extract-Transform-Load\, namely packing refreshing data warehouse, and extract, transformation loading process of data.

Experiments and Analysis  In order to validate the performance and efficiency of alarms association analysis model based on Sequence Clustering algorithm, this paper estimates and analyses the model by experiments Table 1 Original alarms data TID ALARMTIME ADDRESS PPI_AIS 2007-12-04 10:13:07 1-10-8-1-0X04 PPI_LOS 2007-12-04 10:13:16 1-10-8-1-0X03 LP_RDI 2007-12-04 10:15:15 1-10-9-1-0X04   The procedures are programmed by SQL Server and Visual C++. The alarms data comes from the communication network management system of an electric power company, some simple samples \(some attributes are not shown\ of original alarms records are shown in Table 1 Figure 5 States conversion graph for TID  After experiments we can get correlation rules of network management alarms. Figure 5 illustrates states conversion graph for TID field. Similarly we can also take other fields as the forecast field. As long as we get relations \(correlation rules\of the fields which can determine an alarm, such as TID field, ALARMTIME field, and ADDRESS field, we can ensure the correlation rules of alarms Table 2 Correlation rules  Correlation Rules Probability LP_UNEQ -> LP_RDI 0.67 GFP_LOF -> LP_RDI 0.50 AU_LOP -> PPI_AIS 0.50  After the analysis for the states conversion graph we can get alarms correlation rules of relevant fields Table 2 illustrates some correlation rules for TID field

7. Conclusions  This paper combines with mature alarms correlation processing technology, designs a new alarms correlation analysis model. The experiments show that many interesting correlation rules could be acquired efficiently. Furthermore, these rules could be used to guide the intelligent network alarms filtering and fault location. But there are still some problems needing further research and solution, such as intelligent preprocessing of alarms data, multi-field correlation rules mining and so on  8.

5.2 Frequent Set Sampling In the naive Monte Carlo algorithm sketched in the beginning of Section 5.1 the necessary number of trials was prohibitive while the required uniform sampling from the power set did not pose a problem Now the situation is different The required number of trials is polynomially bounded but it is unclear how to sample uniformly from the frequent set families F k  D  f  for k  s  1      n as required for estimating the factors 026 k  We approach this problem by a repeated application of the following procedure Let F old be the current element of F k  Then 1 with probability 1  2 set F new to F old  otherwise 2 uniformly draw an i 2 f 1      k g 3 if e i 2 F old set F new to  F old n f e i g   otherwise 4 if  e i  F old  2 F then set F new to  F old  f e i g   This procedure simulates one step of a Markov chain M F k on F k with state transition probabilities P  F F 0   1  2 k for F F 0 2 F with j F 001 F 0 j  1 where 001 denotes symmetric difference All remaining probability is assigned to the self-loops i.e P  F F   1 000 jf F 0 2 F  j F 001 F 0 j  1 gj  2 k  So the transition probabilities and thus the corresponding state transition matrix P as well as the reachability relation of M F k are symmetric Together with the fact that F is closed under taking subsets this implies that M F k is irreducible because all states are reachable from   Moreover there are non-zero selfloop probabilities for every state This implies that M F k is also aperiodic and together with irreducibility this means that M F k is ergodic For an ergodic Markov chain we know that there is a unique distribution 031 that it converges to and that is stationary i.e P 031  031  Since P is symmetric 031 must be the uniform distribution Hence simulating M F k for suf\002ciently many steps can be used to sample a frequent set from F k uniformly at random as required The question is however for how many steps we have to simulate M F k until it is close enough to the uniform distribution Let M t F k  F  denote the random variable corresponding to simulating M F k for t steps starting in state F  The mixing time 034  017 0  is de\002ned as the smallest number such that the total variation distance between the distribution of M t 0 F k  F  is 017 0 close to the uniform distribution for all possible starting states F 2 F  Here we use the symbol 017 0 in order to set it apart from the accuracy parameter 017 of the algorithm Since we will switch to a heuristic for the number of steps below we will not explain what values of 017 0 would preserve the overall approximation guarantee Instead we refer to for the connection between counting and almost uniform sampling  The reason for using a heuristic is that in line with Theorem 3 a general polynomial bound in size  D  to the mixing time 034 should not be expected Indeed we can observe the following Proposition 4 For n 2 N the Markov chain M F n with frequency threshold f  1 and D  ff 1 g  f 2      n g  f n  2      2 n gg on items E  f 1      2 n g has mixing time 034  017 0  of at least 2 n 000 1 log\(1  2 017 0   Proof Let P  X  denote the power set of a set X  For n 2 N the 1 frequent sets of the dataset given in the claim are F  ff 1 gg  P  f 2      n g   P  f n  2      2 n g  with the cardinality jFj  2 n  The conductance of M F n is de\002ned as 010  min f 010 S  S 022 F  D  1  031  S  024 1  2 g with 010 S  1 031  S  P x 2 S;y 2F n S 031  x  P  x y   It is a well-known fact see for instance that the mixing time of a Markov chain is bounded from below by the conductance as follows 034  017  025 1 4\010 log 1 2 017  6 Now choose S  ff 1 gg  P  f 2      n g  n f;g  Then j S j  2 n 000 1 and consequently 031  S   1  2  010 024 010 S  P x 2 S;y 62 S 031  x  P  x y  031  S   2 X x 2ff 1 g  f n gg 031  x  P  x    2 n 1 2 n 1 2\(2 n   1 2 n 1 Plugging this bound into Equation 6 yields the claim Intuitively the reason for the slow mixing time on these instances is that the probability of crossing over from one of the two blocks P  f 2      n g  and P  f n 1      2 n 000 1 g  to the other is very low compared to their sizes This situation is obviously rather arti\002cial and it is a reasonable assumption that most real-world datasets do not possess such strictly separated blocks For that reason we use for the rest of this paper steps  k 017   017 000 1 k ln k as a heuristic for the required number of steps This is of the same order as the expected number of steps until each item has been drawn at least once coupon collector's theorem reasonable minimum requirement As we will see in the experimental section this heuristic works absolutely 002ne for different test datasets Clearly there are other possible choices for steps  k 017   in particular when there is prior knowledge of the input dataset

5.3 Hybrid Counting Plugging together the Monte Carlo framework with the Markov chains M F  001  we already have an approximation algorithm As indicated in Section 5.1 we have to count a starting factor 026 s exhaustively It remains to decide to what value s should be set—a decision that requires some analysis of the involved time complexities For that we regard one frequency check as unit step We will drop 017 from the parameter lists of trials  001  and steps  001  for ease of notation as it is constant throughout one call of the algorithm Estimating 026 i requires at most trials  s  steps  i  frequency checks On the other hand counting jF s j exhaustively can take up to 2 s frequency checks in case all subsets of E s are frequent This rough bound can be used to make an initial choice for s by choosing it such that it minimizes the estimated overall running time 2 s  T apx  s  with T apx  s   trials  s  n X i  s 1 steps  i  denoting the expected time for approximating all remaining factors Clearly more knowledge about the used implementations—in particular that of the exhaustive miner—is likely to lead to an improvement of this choice Additionally we can further improve our choice of the starting index s  Denote the index found by the considerations above as s 003  The loose a priori bound used there can be improved once we have counted F s 003  We know that jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j 024 jF s 003 j see Equation 3 Thus in case jF s 003 j  T apx  s 003  000 T apx  s 003  1 we can increase s to s 003  1 and add jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j counted exhaustively to jF s j  Clearly as long as the above condition remains true for the new s it amortizes to repeat this step The resulting algorithm counts F s for the 002nal s chunkwise as jF s j  jF s 003 j  jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j  001 001 001  jF s n F s 000 1 j  For the exhaustive counting tasks it is desirable to use one of the existing highly optimized frequent set listing algorithm Let Dj i denote the dataset in which all transactions have been restricted to the 002rst i items Observe that jF  D  f e s g  j s 000 1  j is equal to jF s  D  n F s 000 1  D  j  Thus one external call of the exhaustive miner with the dataset D  f e s g  j s 000 1 suf\002ces to compute the latter quantity This concludes the presentation of techniques used in our counting procedure A 002nal pseudocode incorporating all ideas is given with Algorithm 1 Using the heuristic steps  k   017 000 1 k ln k it performs O 000 017 000 3 n 2 ln n 001 frequency checks Algorithm 1 Hybrid Frequent Set Counting Input  dataset D on items E  f e 1      e n g  frequency threshold f 2 f 1      jDjg  accuracy 017 2 0   Require M F k mixes in steps  k  Output  q with P 1 000 017  jFj 024 q 024 1 017  jFj  025 3  4 1 exhaustive phase 2 s  argmin s 0 024 n 2 s 0  T apx  s 0  3 S  exhaustive  Dj s  f  4 while S  T apx  s  000 T apx  s  1 do 5 S  S  exhaustive  D  f e s 1 g  j s  f  6 s  s  1 7 approximative phase 8 for k  s  1      n do 9 026 k  0 10 for i  1      trials  s 017  do 11 F  M steps  k  F k    12 if e k 62 F then 026 k  026 k  1 13 026 k  026 k  trials  s 017  14 return S Q n i  s 026 000 1 i 6 Evaluation In this section we present experiments contrasting the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with counting via exhaustive enumeration The experiments are performed with respect to performance as well as accuracy  017  0  5 was used throughout all experiments As a representative exhaustive miner we used the modi\002ed FPgrowth algorithm by Grahne and Zhu whose C implementation is publicly available This implementation has shown to rank among the fastest exhaustive miners in the competitive workshop FIMI In the follo wing we will refer to this implementation as F P Z HU  The benchmark datasets are also taken from the FIMI repository supplemented by synthetic datasets generated according to the beginner's guide process Example 2 with different choices for the probabilities p a and p c  For Algorithm 1 we used a Java implementation that is available online together with the arti\002cial datasets  http://www-kd.iai.unibonn.de/index.php?page=people details&id=16 or corresponding main page The experiments were performed on an Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 with 3 GB of RAM running Windows XP All 002gures below use relative frequency thresholds 6.1 A Note on the Implementation The central part of Algorithm 1 is a large number of Markov chain simulations As a 002rst optimization it is possible to do better than just simulating M F k for k

s  1      n naively Instead we 002rst buffer the required number steps  k  of random item indices for a single random walk Since the result of each random walk F is only used to evaluate the Bernoulli experiment of whether item e k is an element of F  we can simply stop the Markov chain simulation after the last occurrence of k in the buffer Similar if e k was put into F due to the next to last occurrence of k we can also stop the chain simulation at that point Since in this case the last occurrence of k will surely cause the item e k to be removed from F again we can directly report that result The really dominant operation however is the test of whether a set I  F  f e g that is an augmentation of a frequent set F with a single item e remains frequent This corresponds to step 4 of the Markov chain see Section 5.2 Since this test has to be performed roughly every second step of each random walk it is crucial for the overall performance of our algorithm In order to decrease the cost of this operation our implementation makes use of FP-trees  Basically  an FP-t ree is a compact representation of the dataset where the transactions in the original dataset are represented as paths in a pre\002x-tree Since overlapping transactions share a branch-pre\002x this usually achieves a signi\002cant compression In addition there are node lists connecting all nodes representing the same item The frequency test for a set is done by selecting its least frequent item and following its node list in the FP-tree adding the counts of all nodes whose parent nodes include all items in the set I  As a minor optimization we have stored at each node a hash set containing the items in the parent nodes While this information is redundant it allows to ef\002ciently determine if a node contributes to the frequency of I  6.2 Accuracy We now report a series of accuracy experiments that are summarized in Figure 2 Our algorithm was applied 100 dataset median low quart max dev failed BMS-POS 0.004 0.004 0.05 0 BMW-Web 0.003 0.003 0.109 0 chess 0.106 0.159 0.56 0.0025 connect 0.092 0.169 0.49 0 mushroom 0.061 0.089 0.24 0 pumsb 0.139 0.297 1.05 0.07 pumsb-star 0.044 0.146 0.372 0 PC60PA13 0.029 0.043 0.139 0 Figure 2 deviation from exact solution times to each combination of one of eight test datasets with one of four frequency thresholds resulting in a total of 3200 runs per dataset A run fails if the reported result deviates from the true number of frequent sets by more than 50 as we used 017  0  5 as accuracy parameter If the overall approximation guarantee holds we expect the fraction of failed runs to be below 1  4 Equation 1 As desired this was the case on all of the eight test datasets In fact in our experiments the highest ratio of failed runs was 0  07 for the pumsb dataset Thus the observed success rate was consistent with the probabilistic approximation guarantee for all datasets and in fact we experienced much better error bounds The table also shows median median lower quartile low quart and maximum max dev of the experienced relative deviation Figure 3 accuracy on chess Figure 3 shows accuracy results on chess in more detail For different frequency thresholds it shows on a logarithmic scale the exact number of sets exact count computed exhaustively the upper and lower 50 deviation limits upper limit and lower limit as well as the result of the randomized algorithm in a series of 16 runs mcmc count The 002gure shows that in most randomized runs the approximated result lies in the desired deviation interval The 002gure does not contain the exact number of sets for the lowest thresholds because these could not be computed by the exhaustive miner We close this subsection by presenting an approximated frequency plot computed for a dataset generated by the example process from Section 2 We refer to this dataset as PC60PA10  because it is an instantiation of this general process with probabilities p c  0  6 and p a  0  1  The result is shown in Figure 4 together with the exact curve and illustrates that the randomized algorithm provides an adequate approximation of the exact plot 6.3 Runtime Next we compare the runtime of our randomized algorithm with that of F P Z HU on several datasets We start with

Figure 4 frequency plot for PC60PA10 counting is infeasible That said on sparse datasets it is hard to compete with the sophisticated and highly ef\002cient frequent set mining algorithm and implementations the data mining community has emerged during the last decade Future Work There are several possible optimizations for Algorithm 1 we did not investigate in this paper For instance in order to speed up frequency tests in subsequent Markov chain simulations it appears to be promising to store maximal frequent sets as well as minimal infrequent sets as they are visited Furthermore the method proposed in this work is not directly optimized towards drawing a frequency-plot i.e it does not bene\002t from the situation when there is more than one frequency threshold for which FREQUENT SETS has to be solved This setting has room for extensive performance improvements that should be explored in future research Some straightforward observations are Exhaustive miners clearly do bene\002t from this situation as they can build up the whole plot by just one run with the lowest involved frequency threshold Similar the Monte Carlo algorithm can acquire a lower bound for F i  f   F i 1  f  already while sampling from F i 1  f 000 1 during the run for threshold f 000 1  Improved lower bounds can then be used to reduce the number of trials for their corresponding factor 026 i  There is another possible speed-up along these lines that is applicable in the single threshold case as well Deriving empirical bounds on the variance of each factor would also allow to reduce the required number of trials On a more global scale an important next step is to investigate whether the randomized counting approach can be extended to other pattern classes like closed sets or graph mining This extension promises to be both challenging and bene\002cial as the cost of exhaustive mining generally increases with the pattern complexity Acknowledgment The authors wish to thank Thomas G  artner for the helpful insights he provided them into Markov chains References  R Bayardo B Goethals and M J Zaki editors Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2004  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  A Bernstein F  Pro v ost and S Hill T o w ard intelligent assistance for a data mining process An ontology-based approach for cost-sensitive classi\002cation IEEE Trans on Knowl and Data Eng  17\(4 2005  M Bole y  On approximating minimum infrequent and maximum frequent sets In Discovery Science  pages 68–77 2007  F  Geerts B Goethals and J V  D Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans Database Syst  30\(2 2005  G Grahne and J Zhu Ef 002ciently using pre\002x-trees in mining frequent itemsets In FIMI'03 Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  2003  D Gunopulos R Khardon H Mannila S Saluja H T oi v onen and R S Sharma Discovering all most speci\002c sentences ACM Trans Database Syst  28\(2 2003  J Han and M Kam ber  Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  Morgan Kaufmann 2000  M Jerrum and A Sinclair  The mark o v chain monte carlo method an approach to approximate counting and integration In Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems  pages 482–520 PWS Publishing Co Boston MA USA 1997  M R Jerrum  L G V aliant and V  V  V azirani Random generation of combinatorial structures from a uniform distribution Theor Comput Sci  43\(2-3 1986  R M Karp M Luby  and N Madras Monte-carlo approximation algorithms for enumeration problems J Algorithms  10\(3 1989  S Khot Ruling out ptas for graph min-bisecti on densest subgraph and bipartite clique In Foundations of Computer Science  pages 136–145 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  K Morik and M  Scholz The miningmart approach In GI Jahrestagung  pages 811–818 2002  J Pei and J Han Can we push more constraints into frequent pattern mining In KDD  pages 350–354 2000  D Randall Rapidly mixing mark o v chains with applications in computer science and physics Computing in Science and Engineering  8\(2 2006  L G V aliant The comple xity of computing the permanent Theor Comput Sci  8:189–201 1979  J W ang J Han Y  Lu and P  Tzv etk o v  TFP An ef 002cient algorithm for mining top-k frequent closed itemsets IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  17\(5 2005  D Zuck erman On unapproximable v ersi ons of np-complete problems SIAM J Comput  25\(6 1996
