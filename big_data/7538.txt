Large-scale data storage is becoming a necessity for healthcare, business segments, government departments scientific endeavors and individuals. Our research will focus on the privacy, security and how we can make sure that big data is secured. Managing security policy is a challenge that our 
framework will handle for big data. Privacy policy needs to be integrated, flexible, context-aware and customizable.  We will build a framework to receive data from customer and then analyze data received, extract privacy policy and then identify the sensitive data. In this paper we will present the techniques for privacy policy which will be created to be used in our framework  Keywords  privacy; big data; security; policy I  I NTRODUCTION  Big Data is a new direction of technology in science government, industry and business h e s i ze of th e dat a set s  for big data is beyond the capabilities of typical database 
software to handle and manage for capturing, storing, and analyzing data. The idea was limited to the current technology available during those times of processing and storage of huge volume of data. Data is always the most important resource in our society. For example, gove rnment agencies are collecting information that contains private data. Big data security has grown fast as a signi  cant concern for clients over the past few years. 88% of the clients were substantially worried on their data privacy T h e s ecu rit y is s u es are in creas ing an d it  is happening because of the increasing usage of big data through adaptation of this technology. There are many benefits of big data. Although, it is vulnerable to attacks  Attackers are consistently trying to find loopholes to attack the

Big Data is hu ge volume of data that is structured or unstructured and itis very difficult to handle by normal databases technologies and software tools   [4  Th e exponential growth in volume of data with the speed of data gathering and processing for data inputs coming from large implementation of massive connected devices such   as; cars smartphones, RFID readers, webcams, and sensor networks require huge resources to handle this size of data and ensuring the security of data. Data streams are generated by these devices continuously without human intervention. With these different sources of unstructured data, it results to have diverse 
types of data. The massive volume, velocity, and variety of data have a tremendous impact to existing security solutions Security solutions for big data were not developed and intended to handle huge volume of data such as Big Data. The past two years have generated 90% of the world's data The amount of data is doubled every two years that require having different storage strategies with different storage media  B i g data s ecu rit y an d priv ac y are big ch alle n g e s f o r customers and service providers Eig h t y percen t of larg e organization will endure suffering from major security issues with big data by 2016[7 M o s t of t h es e are n o t i n  s t an da rd  forms which make it more difficult to analyze with the available tools today 2013 Bi g Dat a h a s be en  
introduced as one of the new technology trends, but facing big challenges with security and priv acy issues which threatens to slow the momentum There are many challenges facing big data, security and privacy are just some of these challenges. It has been reported that big data advancement increases the threats to the existing security of the data. One issue with big data privacy is policy management and how to enforce it with this huge data and not affecting the performance Privacy policy needs to be integrated, flexible, contextaware and custom protect th e u s er s priv a c y  many privacy solutions have been proposed. One proposed solution is to use integration of privacy protection mechanism  m o s t of t h e s t u d ies  it c o n cen trates o n s i ng le m ech a n i s m  
while this study focuses on applying more than one mechanism to secure user privacy. eXtensible Access Control Markup Language  \(XACML\was developed to be used as uniform control policies and has  been used for privacy XACML is an XML-based language standardized by the organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards \(OASIS Due to its size and volume, especially as they attempt to maximize data efficiency and performance, protecting Big Data \(while it is in storage\ ha s been a challenge for the most of organizations. The optimal data protection is to ensure that when it falls into unauthorized hands, it is meaningless Big data security is categorized in different levels which 
includes; communications, processing, authentication, and storage level. Current technology was not built for big data security. Data is stored in plain text, wherein critical information can be easily stolen by hackers. Logging to critical data is not logged in which means any abused of data cannot be identified. This technology is used by most businesses to store and analyze their own data and their customer’s data which makes privacy and security very important in gaining the confidence of customers. Hence there is a need for investing, studying, and understanding the challenges and providing better solutions to secure big data 


Big data security is a major challenge in the field of research for   scientists. Our research will focus on big data storage and enforcing the privacy policy. First, we will focus on how to protect data in storage. The use of encryption fragmentation, authentication and secure communication within our framework will secure the big data storage which will be enforced based on the policy identified by client Today, business depends on customer’s data protection Data about health, shopping, purchasing and traveling is contained collected digital inform ation. The data are collected by businesses to aid in decision making and help to attain their goals. They analyze the data and use it to direct their customers in the way that achieve their goals. While this could be used legally, but sometimes it could be illegal. In 2014 92% internet users in the US were worried regarding their online privacy while 89% avoid dealing with companies on the cloud as they feel that their data is not secure West in i n e d pri v ac y as  P ri v a c y i s  t h e cl aim o f  individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others Big data security and privacy are big challenges for customers and service providers Eig h t y percen t of larg e organization will endure suffering from major security issues with big data by 2016[6 M o s t of t h es e are n o t i n  s t an da rd  forms which make it more difficult to analyze with the available tools of today   Beneficial information can be extracted and analyzed from digital information collected fr om different sources such as credit card companies, government agencies, banking, and health care. Regardless of the usage of the information and the benefit, privacy and security is the main challenge in big data The privacy problem is main concern these days that comes because of the huge amount of personal information available on internet [11 as d i gital in f o r m atio n  Managing security policy is a challenge that our framework will handle for big data.

[12 in tr o d u c e d P o lic y M a na ge m e nt a s a  Service \(PMaaS\ramework for cloud based policy management is designed, so the users can control their policies to access the resources of where they are stored. The framework consists of cloud user who manages the access policies on the policy management service provider. In addition, it also includes a policy management service provider which de  nes, edits and manages the access policies The cloud service provider which is the third component controls the access to the protected resources based on the policies identified by the cloud users. The last one is the requester which is an application which cooperates with a cloud service provider to be able to access the protected resource belonging to the speci  c cloud user Kudakwashe Zvarevashe et al ted s ecu rit y cas e s f o r  big data starts with securing computations which may also return wrong result and at the same time, it is difficult to discover whether  the data is faulty or not. The second one is the security for non-relational data stores where the security depends on the middleware. The next security case is securing data storage and how we can protect unauthorized access to data. Then they explain the impor tance of validating, the input devices.  Real time security monitoring is  a changes in the area of big data security. Privacy of clients during data mining is another important case for big data security. Securing the data from end to end is one of the big data security cases In this paper they recommend solutions to these challenges to big data security which uses Kerberos system for authenticating,  both   users an d services to ensure privacy between communicating protocol and users on the Internet the Transport Layer Security \(TLS\ is utilized. Data encryption is one way to secure data in storage with having a key encryption saved and available to reuse the data when needed. Secure and validate an y software needed to be deployed Kevin et al opos ed a f r a m e w or k  f o r enf o rci n g policy in managing cloud data which considers three important items: data type, computation and policy requirements A policy-compliant data processing framework with the following modules was proposed Policy-reasoning module which maps a policy to a speci  c set of tasks Data processing task rewriting module: enforces policies by considering different rewriting strategies Pre-processing module: executes the pre-processing tasks on the underlying data Post-processing module: to process the  nal results to enforce policies Most of security tools fail to work with big data environment, so these tools need to be able to scale with the data [14  T h e existi n g b i g d a ta secur i t y  so lut i o n s  w h ich ar e not developed and intended for huge volume, velocity, and variety cannot protect this amount of data g d a t a  security is adapting the traditional security tools. They recommend placing the security closer to the data storage instead of having the security at the data center level. It is not bound to the number of policy sets, policies and rules and they showed the enhancement of performance by applying their way. Meanwhile, it still needs more work for better XACML performance In f o r t h e con v e n i e n ce for t h e pr ov i d ers of cl ou d dat a  storage, a security agenda has been offered to implement the security strategies and policies with the help of policy management module.   This allows the system to assess the activities of users and analyze them for every system and finally categorized as fair” or “malicious”.  To make sure that system is going to work according to the   requirements and set policy definitions, a strategy has been enforced for security maintenance. Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications 


III  S OLUTION A RCHITECTURE  This section details the security policy management framework that efficiently enforces the sensitive data security policy. The policy enforcement framework must support different data processing requirements and must be highly flexible. To implement these modules efficiently, it needs to be specialized for different data types, computation types and policy requirements It is built on the concept of data distribution on mulita cloud service providers. Figure1 shows a high level view of the framework which includes the main components. The first component is the “Security Module” which receives data from client and then extracts the security rules and passes it to the policy management” which is the second component of our framework. Figure2 illustrates the framework and its components in more detail                 Client: A client uses different cloud service providers to store big data. The client is in charge of defining security policies which will be used by cloud service providers to identify sensitive data when a requester attempts to store data Security module: the security model is the core part of our solution which applies security polices to data to identify sensitive from non-sensitive and then execute the fragmentation algorithm to sensitive data Policy Management: A policy management enables the service provider to edit and manage the security policies At the beginning the ‘Extract Security Policy’ receives data with security constraints as part of the data, then analyzes the data and extracts the security rules. Security specification is passed to the Policy Translation Point \(PTP\ which translates the policy to unify format XACML.  Security policy can be written based on the data ty pe.  It identifies the rules to  be able to identify the sensitive and non-sensitive data. The client specifies the security rules, due to that; they know the data and the sensitivity of it. Th e sensitive association rules is a special group of association rules which represents the sensitive data. Once the ‘Extract Security Policy’ identifies the security policy, it will update the policy database These security rules are important for making decision and need to remain private \(i.e the rules are private to the company or organization owning the data\The Policy Decision Point \(PDP\es the request to lookup for the security policy for certain user. If it is found, it will be sent to the Policy Enforcement Point \(PEP\. The PEP will send the security constrains to the data analyzer which will identify sensitive and non-sensitive data based on the security constrains. It can specify their policies as part of their data which are translated by the policy management into XACML language. The policy management acts as a policy administration point \(PAP\ policy information point \(PIP and Policy Enforcement Point \(PEP\ Our framework does not inflict any restrictions on security policies specified by clients and our aim here is to allow clients to specify their policies without any restriction. Once the security policies are determined   in client form at, the PTP parses the policy identi  es policy elements, and transforms the policy into XACML. Access controls over the stored data are provided through a XACML_policy-based security. The policies are separated based on client, using the association between client and the security policy They do not need to deal with various policies beyond this system. The following algorithm is used to extract the security policy and identify the sensitive data Input   D: Data to be store C= {c1, c2,……ci}/* a set of security constraints Output   S ={s1,s2,…….sm} /*Security policy RS ={rs1,rs2,…..,rsk} /* association between data and Security policy Main   get data identify data type extract security constraints \( C associate Security policy to data  \(RC update meta data      Client  Security Module  Policy  Specification  Data  Policy Management  Security Policy  Fig.1.

increase threshold of 0.7 percent and a decrease threshold of 0.9 percent 67,728 and 41,367 points were detected respectively We computed all of the visual features listed in Table 1 for the detected points using the features to lter and aggregate points We then rejected the change points based on user-specied lters and visualized the aggregated result Analyzing the increase and decrease points revealed valuable knowledge such as which types of programs were of interest to people which program features resulted in high TV ratings and how people behaved following a certain type of event Figure 5 shows the system interface and ow In the following we exemplify system usage by analyzing what type of news captured users interests Filtering The user rst species the lters in accordance with the analysis target Table 2 summarizes the lters that can be used Here because we want to analyze the news we select the news category lter see the top left corner of Figure 5 Statistical analysis The points after ltering are aggregated and visualized which provides a clue to nd the meaningful pattern of TV rating increases/decreases That is the visualized results display information that should help identify which feature is related to the TV ratings For each visual feature the differences in the means of the feature values over the increased/decreased change points is shown in Figure 5 see the feature statistics This information indicates which features are correlated with TV ratings Features with a large difference seem to contribute to an increase in the TV rating and vice versa A breakdown in the form of pie charts of the change points by dominant color and emotion  Filters Add/change lters Apply Þlters Feature statistics of Þltered points Feature distribution Breakdown by object See details of selected feature Breakdown by dominant color and em otion Ratings graph List of change points Figure 5 The interface for the user behavior mining tools It shows how to use the tools and what each function indicates Table 2 Filters used in our framework Filter Argument input Exclude program boundary On or off Exclude CF On or off Limit to transition at time of CF On or off enabled or disabled Visual feature Category of feature threshold such as entropy—more than 0.5 Time period Start time end time such as 19:00–23:00 Term List of months such as Sept Oct Nov Category Category of TV program such as news Keywords List of keywords such as Kinugawa River April–June 2017 49 


is also displayed in Figure 5 Dominant color means the color with the highest value of the 11 basic colors The same is true of dominant emotion The user selects the feature that seems to be important from these charts in order to analyze it in detail In this example the user selects the feature blue Feature details The system then shows in the form of a graph details for the features selected by the user The graph shows the distribution of the selected features in terms of increase and decrease points It also shows a breakdown by dominant regenerated objects for the change points with the 200 highest values the bluest objects in this example Thumbnails of the points corresponding to each object are also shown These charts reveal that blue is the most signicant color because of the weather reports indicating that the viewers were highly interested in such reports In addition to these charts the system shows lists of points with thumbnails and related information sorted by the feature value see the list of changes points in Figure 5 The system also provides more detail for each point in the form of a ratings graph along with the program guide information Refiltering with interactive feedback We can interactively add or change lters to discover additional patterns In the example shown in Figure 5 the object corresponding to weather reports ID  85 can be ltered out by adding a lter for object features This lter lets us analyze popular new topics after removing the noise from the weather report In this way numerous patterns of audience behavior can be discovered by combining various types of ltering with interactive feedback Figures 6 and 7 show examples of questions that can be asked to obtain knowledge from TV ratings data using our framework The rst three questions Q1–Q3 shown in Figure 6 represent an analysis for nding a particular pattern of a ratings increase for a specic category—here the categories were news dramas and variety shows In addition to the program category lter we used the lters that extract transitions made during a CF to focus on people’s interest in the program content For the news program Figure 6a we found that weather reports and sports news were popular For dramas Figure 6b scores for black and dominance computed from the brightness and saturation were the highest The example thumbnails indicate that scenes where the screen is heavily dark tend to be serious scenes during which viewers usually stay on that channel For variety shows Figure 6c we found that high entropy and amusement tend to increase TV ratings The example thumbnails indicate that lively scenes match the needs of people watching variety shows The difference in user behavior for variety shows versus dramas becomes clear when comparing the visualizations produced by our system In contrast to Q1–Q3 for our fourth question Q4 focuses on the decrease points see Figure 7a Because the initial statistics suggest that there’s a correlation between the color brown and decrease points we selected brown and found that people tended to switch the channels during news commentary and live televised broadcasts of parliament ary proceedings On the basis of the results we ltered out objects corresponding to news commentary and parliamentary proceedings to analyze other factors After ltering black seemed the most signicant feature By selecting and further analyzing this color feature we found that live broadcasts in the dark are also correlated with a ratings decrease For Q5 we tested whether animals inuence ratings see Figure 7b We rst compared the distribution of the scores for an animal between the increase and decrease points for certain categories and found that a difference was observed especially for variety shows To discover more about how an animal can contribute to TV ratings we used an animal lter with a threshold score of 0.3 Analyzing decrease points revealed that animals do indeed seem to inuence ratings except for animals in water For Q6 we targeted a specic event the ooding of the Kinugawa River to learn how viewers behaved following that event We searched for the target event by combining the following lters month program category and keywords The increase and decrease points revealed that people tended to watch live broadcasts and turn to other channels when live event coverage ends News Event Detection and Analysis We developed an application to detect news stories of interest by analyzing the set of change points in news programs We use increase points observed in two categories—news and informational programs—which reect viewers interest in news stories In addition to nding popular IEEE MultiMedia 50 


news topics our analysis revealed other valuable knowledge For example by comparing broadcasting times and ratings increases we could analyze whether the intention of TV stations matched the interests of viewers In addition analyzing audience behaviors when watching news about a disaster can help broadcasters and others determine how best to disseminate information regarding disaster preparedness to maximize who sees retains and acts on such information We detect news stories by analyzing keywords that co-occur with increase points We rst construct a graph from change points with each node corresponding to an increase point We can nd clusters that consist of multiple change points by mining the graph The clusters that contain the most increase points correspond to the news stories of most interest The details of the detection algorithms are described elsewhere 5 To evaluate whether our method could detect important news stories we used the top 10 news stories in Japan for 2015 as reported by the Yomiuri newspaper as the ground truth Table 3 shows the correspondence between the ground truth and our top 10 detected results The CP column shows the rank based on the number of change points in each detected news story This result shows our method detected ve of the 10 ground truth stories The Yomiuri rankings shows the big news stories in general while our rankings shows the news that viewers were most interested in because many people switch channels to a specic news story at the change point Our results revealed that viewers tended to switch the channel to negative news stories such as those about a murder or disaster to proactively collect more information about the specic news stories However viewers didn’t actively switch the channels to positive news stories such as those covering a Nobel Prize aware or the Rugby World Cup the viewers instead passively watched the stories Table 3 also shows the accumulated airtime of each news story The murder cases that were ranked in our results but not ranked by the      Q1: In what type of news are people interested Q2: What makes audiences watch drama Q3: What is the key indicator to increase ratings for variety shows  A: People are interested in weather reports and sports news  A: People tend to stay on a channel in serious scenes when the screen becomes dark  A: People want lively scenes with high entropy in variety shows Blue Black Entropy Amusement Dominance Weather  report Green Sports news Filter  news Filter  drama Filter  variey Filter  news, remove object \(85 Remove weather report a b c Figure 6 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to detect an increase in ratings for a specific category These examples answer questions about a news b drama and c variety shows April–June 2017 51 


Yomiuri newspaper the Osaka Kawasaki and Wakayama murder cases were ranked highly in airtime while the important news stories that were not detected by our method such as the launch of Hokuriku Shinkansen also received much airtime This indicates that TV stations broadcast important news stories equally to some extent regardless of people’s level of interest while news stories of public interest receive more airtime We also analyzed how the information related to a disaster is broadcast and viewed We compared the three disasters the ooding of the Kinugawa River on 10 September 2015 Figure 8a the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 Figure 8b and the Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake on 10 January 1995 Figure 8c We extracted the broadcasting time for each disaster with appropriate keywords and compared the three disasters using airtime and ratings within the broadcasting time Figure 8 shows the accumulated airtime per day and the highest per-minute rating in a day within broadcasting time for each of the three disasters Airtime is indicative of the TV stations intent while we used the highest per-minute rating to show what percentage of people watched news about the disaster that day This result shows that the ooding of the Kinugawa received the most airtime Figure 8a and many people watched the broadcast 26 percent which is signicantly high in Japan On the other hand the Great Hanshin Earthquake which occurred 20 years earlier was not as widely broadcast and thus had lower ratings Figure 8c Although ratings for the Great East Japan Earthquake which happened four years before the Kinugawa ooding are not as significant as for the ooding on that particular day 11 March 2011 TV stations spent a lot of time broadcasting the disaster and nearly 20 percent of potential viewers were watching Moreover this event occurred between two holidays which also might have been a contributing factor in terms of the number of people watching This suggests the intention of   Q4: When do people switch the channel in news programs Q5: Do animals inßuence ratings Q6: How did the audience behave when the Kinugawa River ßooded  A: People tend to switch channels during news commentary, parliamentary proceedings, and live broadcasts in the dark  A: Animals inßuence ratings, especially for variety shows, except for animals in water  A: People tended to watch live broadcasts and switch the channel when the scene changed Brown Distribution of animal scores for each program category News Blue Gray Example of increase points Example of decrease Information Drama Variety Black Blue Filter  news Filter  news reject object \(18, 82, 67 Filter  animal>0.3 Filter  news+information keyword \(Kinugawa Remove some objects a b c Figure 7 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to a detect a rating decrease for news programs b determine whether animals contribute to ratings and c detect audience behavior related to an event IEEE MultiMedia 52
