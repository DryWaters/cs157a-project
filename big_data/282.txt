Mining Generalized Association Rules for Sequential and Path Data Wolfgang Gaul Lars Schmidt-Thieme Institut fur Entscheidungstheorie und Unternehmensforschung University of Karlsruhe D-76 128 Karlsruhe, Germany  WolfgangGaul LarsSchmidt-Thieme  wiwi.uni-karlsruhe.de Abstract While association rules for sei daia use and describe relations between parts of sei valued objecis completely association rules for sequential daia are restricted by specijic inierpreiations of the subsequence relation: coniiguous subsequences describe local feaiures of a sequence valued objeci noncontiguoussubsequences its 
global feaiures We model boih types of feaiures with general ized subsequences that describe local deviations by wildcards and present a new algorithm of Apriori type for mining all generul ized subsequences wiih prescribed minimum suppori from a given database of sequences Furthermore we show thui the given algo riihm automatically rakes into accouni an eventually underlying graph structure i.e is applicable to path data also 1 Introduction Classical association rules describe dependencies be tween subsets of a large sample of set valued objects e.g market baskets A typical association rule states 
that if a certain subset occurs in a set then another subset is likely to occur in the same set \(with estimated probabilities for the applicability and the strictness of the rule For set valued objects subsets are natural substructures to consider To sequential data association rules can be applied in dif ferent ways One can forget the sequence structure and map sequences on the sets of their elements but looses ordering information Or one looks for sequential association rules i.e pairs of subsequences that occur in order in a sequence Here two different notions of substructures can be found in 
the literature contiguous subsequences of elements that occur one after the other in a sequence, and non-contiguous subsequences where between two elements arbitrary noise may be interspersed While the former describes local fea tures of sequences the latter describes global features of se quences We combine both types of descriptions in general ized subsequences where possible noise is explicitly marked by a wildcard element The hard part of the computation of association rules is the computation of frequent sets or subsequences Frequent subsets of set valued objects can be mined by the standard Apriori algorithm \(see Agrawal and Srikant \(1994 Fre quent contiguous 
or non-contiguous subsequences can be mined by a well-known variant of the Apriori algorithm see Agrawal and Srikant \(1995 with modifications by Srikant and Agrawal 1996 Borges and Levene 1 999 have de veloped algorithms for sequence mining on aggregated data Several algorithms exist to mine frequent generalized sub sequences of a specij?ed Qpe called templates i.e subse quences with prescribed positions of wildcards see e.g Spiliopoulou \(1999 Other authors following a broader approach have constructed algorithms to find frequent sub sequences of objects with attached attributes and relations called generalized episodes 
see Mannila and Toivonen 1996 While those algorithms are perfectly suited for use in interactive analysis a general algorithm mining all fre quent generalized subsequences of a given minimum sup port as needed for association rule analysis is still missing In this paper we describe a new algorithm that fills this gap If sequence data describes paths on a graph an algorithm mining frequent subpaths should take advantage of the un derlying graph structure i.e only consider paths and no sequences of non-connected vertices We show that our al gorithm has this property automatically \(by using a 
suitable join operator and thus also solves the problem of mining frequent subpaths 2 Formal background Definition 1 Let R be an arbitrary finite set of non interpreted items and R  uiEN Ri the set of finite se quences of elements of R with 0 as the empty sequence For a sequence z E R the length 1x1 is the number of sym bols in the sequence 1x1  n for z E R 101  0 
For x y E R we say that x is a contiguous subsequence ofy z Sct y if there is an index i E 0   IyI  1x1 with zj  yi+j We say that x is a non-contiguous subsequence of y x Lnct y if there is a strictly increasing map Vj  1   121 0-7695-1 119-8101 17.00 0,2001 IEEE 593 


i   1    1x1   1   Iyl with xJ  tlj  We use the neutral symbol 5 to denote one of the two subsequence relations Sct or Lnct x is called a strict sub sequence of y x  y if it is a subsequence of y but not equal to y x 5 y A x  y Definition 2 A pair of sequences 2 y E 200i overlaps on k E N elements if the last k elements of x are equal to the first k elements of y l~l-k  yz Vi  1  k For such a pair of sequences x y E P overlapping on k elements we define the k-telescoped concatenation of x and y to be 1   121 k Y  21  72\(4-k,Y11  Ylyl  21  1 qzl Yk+l   I Ylyl Note that any two sequences 0-overlap and the 0 telescoped concatenation of two sequences is just their ar rangement one behind the other Definition 3 For a pair of sets of sequences X Y P we denominate the set of b-overlapping pairs x E X y E Y by S k Y and the set of k-telescoped sequences of all k overlapping pairs as the set of k-telescoped sequences of X and Y 1 k 1  k\(-Y k Y  E k y I x E X y E Y are over lapping on k elements With this terminology an elegant formulation of the Apriori algorithm for sequences can be given that is omit ted here for space restrictions see Gaul/Schmidt-Thieme 2001 3 Mining frequent generalized subsequences Definition 4 By a generalized sequence in R we mean a finite ordinary\sequence in the symbols R U  with an additional symbol  R called wildcard so that no two wildcards are adjacent Rgen  x E RU  I Bi E N  zi  xi+l   The wildcard symbol  is used to model partially inde terminate sequences, matching arbitrary subsequences. For a generalized sequence x E Rgen we define its length 1x1 as the length of the sequence in the symbols R U  i.e 1x1  n if x E R U  Definition 5 Now let x y E Rgen be two generalized sequences We say that x matches y or y generalizes x y 1 x if there exists a mapping m  1   1.1  1  1 IYl called matching with the following properties 1 m maps indices of elements of x to indices of elements of y that coincide or to a wildcard y,\(i  Z or 2 m covers all indices of y of non-wildcard elements Ym\(i   yi E R  m-l\(i  0 3 m is weakly increasing 4 m is even strictly increasing at places where its image does not belong to a wildcard m\(i  m\(i  1  Note that as the set of ordinary sequences R is a sub set of the set of generalized sequences Rgen this also de fines the notion of an ordinary sequence matching a gen eralized sequence Obviously matchings are not uniquely determined by two generalized sequences x and y A trivial example is A I AA with the two matchings ml  1 e 1,2 e 2 and m2  1 e 2,2 e 3 Finally we carry over the notions of subsequence and of k-telescoped concatenation from ordinary sequences to generalized sequences without any change Note the difference between A  C not being a subsequence of ABCD but generalizing a subsequence of it i.e. A C k ABC and ABC 5 ABCD For simplicity of notation we omit parentheses and commas in example sequences and just write ABC instead of A,B,C Definition 6 Let S be a finite mu1ti of ordinary se quences For an arbitrary generalized sequence x E Rgen we denominate the relative frequency of sequences contain ing a subsequence which matches x as support of x with respect to S Ym\(i   I{s E s I 3y 5 s  5 I y}I IS1 sup,\(z  Mining frequent generalized subsequences is the label for the task of finding all generalized sequences with at least a given minimum support As subsequences actu ally are what we are looking for we can narrow our view to closed generalized subsequences i.e generalized subse quences without leading or trailing wildcard x E Rgen with At present no general algorithm for finding all frequent generalized subsequences in a mu1ti of sequences is known We present a modification of the Apriori algorithm for sequences to generalized sequences The idea is rather straightforward As we restrict ourselves to closed gener alized sequences the support of any subsequence of such a closed generalized sequence again is greater than or equal to the support of the sequence itself Adjacent wildcards are not allowed, therefore we obtain every closed general ized sequence of length n  1 for n  3 as the junction of two overlapping closed generalized sequences of the kind described in table 1 11 qz1 E RI More formally we state 594

Closed generalized subsequences of length 3 containing a wildcard have the form 2  y with x y E R shorter closed gener alized subsequences cannot contain wildcards The following algorithm gives the exact formulation of the necessary comparisons Obviously the computation of the support values of the candidate generalized sequences also has to be modified The performance characteristics of the algorithm is the same as for the Apriori algorithm for  Apriori algorithm adapted for generalized sequences Require set of items R mu1ti S of \(finite sequences of elements of R minimum support value minsup E R Ensure set of frequent \(closed\generalized subsequences F  UnEW F of the sequences of S with support of at least minsup C   T I T E R set of initial candidates n  1 Fo  0 while C  0 or Fn-1  0 do compute sups\(c occurrences of each c in S one loop through S Fn  c E C I sups\(c 2 minsup C  F Sn-l F compute new candidate sequences with length n+l  if n  2 then introduce wildcards else if n  2 then additional joins considering wild cards Vc E C by counting the number of C:=CU{\(x,*,y I X,yEFn-1 c  c U{x n-2 Y I 2 y E Fn en-2 Fn-1~22   U{X tL--2 Y I 2 Y E Fn-1 an-2 Fn Ylyl-1   U{X n-3 y I x y E Fn-1 an-3 Fn-1 22  Ylyl-1   end if n:=n+l end while ordinary sequences to find sequences of length n n loops through the database have to be accomplished We state some additional results for the special case of sequences describing paths on a graph They apply to ordi nary contiguous or noncontiguous sequences as well as to generalized sequences Definition 7 Let G  E be a directed graph with vertices R and edges E E R x R A generalized sequence t E Ben of vertices is called a path fragment if there are replacements for the wildcards that yield a path on G i.e for all i  1    1x1  1 with xi   0 if xi+l  then xi zi+l E E 0 if ti+l  then there is a path pi E h connecting xi and x;+2 i.e pi  pi    p with pi  xi p  2i+2 and p;,p E E for all j  1   n  1 We denote as set of path fragments of G the set Rgen  E E Rgen 1 2 is a path fragment Lemma 2 Path Fragment Construction If z,y E RgenI are path fragments on a graph G of length 1x1 yI L 2 that k-overlap with k 2 1 then their k telescoped concatenation x k y again is a path fragment on G 595 


The proof is omitted due to space restrictions see Gaul/Schmidt-Thieme \(2001 The lemma guarantees that only path fragments are constructed during the candidate generation process 4 Generalized association rules As the retrieval of frequent \(generalized\subsequences is the hard part of the generation of association rules, we can easily apply our algorithm to find association rules for gen eralized sequences with prescribed minimum support and confidence Definition 8 In analogy to ordinary association rules be tween sets a contiguous generalized association rule is \(de scribed by a pair of l-overlapping \(generalized\sequences x y E Rgen written 2 t y One defines the support of an association rule x  y as the support of the concate nated sequence 2 1 y  21     x1,1  y1    ylyl and its conjdence as the fraction of the sequences containing 2 I y of the sequences containing x Speaking of association rules one has their interpretation as fuzzy rules in mind i.e. that if the body x of the rule has occurred in a sequence then the occurrence of x is contin ued by the head y of the rule, where occurrence is related to sequences from the underlying set S The support gives a measure for the applicability of the rule i.e the overall per centage of sequences where it holds, while the confidence gives a measure for the strictness with which the ruie holds i.e., in what percentage of sequences that it is applicable to it holds Finding all association rules with a given minimum sup port and confidence means nothing else but finding all fre quent sequences with at least the given minimum support and then trying the different splits of the found frequent se quences and checking the confidence of the resulting rules  Please note that it is crucial for this application that the algorithm which finds the frequent subsequences also finds all subsequences of every subsequence returned and accord ingly already has computed all support values needed The definition of an association rule can be extended to generalized sequences without any modification But using generalized sequences opens an additional possibility Definition 9 A non-contiguous generalized association rule is \(described by a pair of generalized sequences 2 y written 2 y y Its support and confidence are defined as follows 5 Outlook Generalized sequences can be interpreted as non contiguous subsequences of contiguous subsequences i.e as nested structures of second order This interpretation opens the application of Apriori type algorithms to a huge range of new data and pattern structures A unified frame work for mining adequate substructures of such data will be presented in a forthcoming paper References Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R 1 994 Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules In Bocca J.B Jarke M and Zaniolo C eds Proceedings of the 20th Interna tional Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB 94 September 12-15, 1994, Santiago de Chile 487499 Agrawal R and Srikant R 1995 Mining Sequential Patterns In Yu P.S and Chen A.L.P eds Proceed ings of the Eleventh International Conference on Data En gineering March 6-10 1995 Taipei Taiwan 3-14 Borges J and Levene M 1999 Data Mining of User Navigation Patterns In Proceedings of the Workshop on Web Usage Analysis and User Profiling WEBKDD'99 August 15 1999 San Diego CA 31-36 Gaul W and Schmidt-Thieme L 2001 Mining Generalized Association Rules for Sequential and Path Data Working paper Unversity of Karlsruhe 200 1 http://www.webmining-research.comlworking-paper Mannila H and Toivonen H 1996 Discovering gen eralized episodes using minimal occurrences In The Sec ond International Conference on Knowledge Discovey and Data Mining KDD 96 Portland, Oregon, August 2-4 1996 146-151 Spiliopoulou M 1999 The Laborious Way from Data Mining to Web Mining Int Journal of Conzp Sys., Sei  Eng 14 1999 Special Issue on Semantics of the Web 113 126 Srikant R and Agrawal R 1996 Mining Sequen tial Patterns Generalizations and Performance Improve ments In Apers P.M.G Bouzeghoub M and Gar darin G eds Advances in Database Technology  EDBT'96 5th International Conference on Extending Database Technology Avignon France March 25-29 1996, Proceedings LNCS 1057 596
