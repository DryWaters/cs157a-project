However, overseas oil imports exists such as piracy attacks, line accident and other risk during transportation, so a reasonable choice of transportation paths can control cost, reduce risk. A multi-objective transportation problem which considering distance and risk in the supply of oil import is presented. Then a mathematic model of this transportation problem is established. Based on a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola, and then solving the model by a distance-risk matrix for a optimal compromise solution, finally with the actual data about China's crude oil imports in 2006 for the model verification, in order to provide policy suggest for china to choosing reasonable transportation paths Keywords  Oil transportation; Fuzzy theory; multi-objective programming; distance-risk matrix  1  I NTRODUCTION   Oil resources as a major energy and chemical raw materials, is the basis energy of modern industrial China's oil resources supply and demand situation has a direct impact on the country's social stability and economic security, particularly since 2002 China become the world's second largest oil consumer. With economic development, China's dependency upon overseas oil will be higher. According to General Administration of Customs released the data, crude oil imports in 2008 amounted to 1.7889 million tons with the dependency has more than 50%, close to red lines, in addition to 2009 Blue Paper on China's energy forecast released China's oil import dependency will rise to 64.5% in 2020 In  the process of overseas oil imports, transportation is a vital link, which directly affects the success of the entire import process. According to customs statistics, China's oil imports by sea of about 95%, and in the whole process of transportation paths involved in the line accident, port risk, pirate attacks, and many other uncertain factors, It is estimated that China's oil imports nearly 85% is transported through the Malacca Strait, while the Malacca Strait has always been the focus of the region by pirate attacks. The other hand, the distance of the transportation paths is a direct impact on transportation cost, how to balancing the risk and distance cost is a worthy issue for studying. Some foreign scholars have already studied about the oil transportation from overseas, but most of them in pursuit of the lowest total cost, minimum total time and other single-target model However, this paper based on a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola using distance-risk matrix to solve the model for a optimal compromise solution, finally by a case study about China's crude oil imports in 2006  to verify the model , in order to provide policy suggestion for China to choose  reasonable transportation paths 2  L ITERATURE R EVIEW  With regard to overseas oil transportation and multiobjective problem has become the focus research for scholars at domestic and abroad, such as Carla Oliveira Carlos Henggeler.

imports were mainly dependent on sea transport, from the carrier risk, pirate attacks and other factors to analysis the risk of sea transport, but the article is mainly from a qualitative point of view on China's oil imports risk ,there is no practical case analysis  For China's overseas oil transportation not only to emphasize the lowest cost of oil transportation, the risk should get the same attention, therefore, In this paper using a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to carry out non-dimensional treatment target, and thus find the lowest distance and risk cost about oil transportation of  multi-objective optimization program  3  MODELING AND SOLVING 2.1 Description of  the problem  In the process of the imports for overseas oil resources assuming that each area's oil resources is only one port and m ports of resources imported into China by sea to n ports. The i resources port be able to supply oil resources is i a  i 1,2, ... ... m\, the j ports need oil is i b  j 1,2 ... ... n\, and 11 mn ij ij ij ab    d the risk about the i resources ports to the j ports is ij p the distance is ij l   For the import of overseas oil resources in multiobjective transportation problems, we intend to pursue the smallest distance cost and the lowest risk cost of multi-objective optimization model. The objective function which pursuit the smallest distance cost is as follows  1 11 min mn ij ij ij z lx     The lowest cost of risk in the pursuit of the objective function is as follows 2 11 min mn ij ij ij z cx     But for these two goals do not have the cumulative nature, we can carry out a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to dimensionless processing for determining the indicatorês grade of membership, and then using fuzzy linear programming method to transforming a multi-objective into a single-objective transportation problem, getting a distance-risk matrix   for   solving the model In addition, we can calculate the distance-risk matrix of the basic feasible solution of the maximum distance and the greatest risk of fuzzy sets to take control of key line setting goals, decision-making. We can establish the following objective function as follows min max  k kij z d   The objective function constraints are as follows 1 1 12 11 1 2 1 2   0  n ij i j m ij j i ij ij ij ij mn ij i i ij x ai m x bj n st dld p x ab                         ij x   refers to the ridership from the i ports to the j  ports 1 ij d  refers to the distance from the i ports to the j  ports 2 ij d  refers to the risk rate from the i ports to the j  ports 2.2 Model  Solution  Definition 1: For the above models ideal solution is to make k-objective functions to optimize simultaneously but the best compromise solution is a solution which decision-makers select the most preferred and effective solution according to the criteria for assessment of priorities in all feasible solutions  But such as a complex multi-objective programming problem for overseas oil transportation, the establishment of an appropriate evaluation function is more difficulty in this paper we use fuzzy linear programming method to transfer multi-objective problem into single-objective transportation problem which can be more convenient to find an optimal compromise solution 2.3 Grade membership of  indicator  All of the above indicators, the line distance and  risk rate are all dimensionless value, because of their differences in dimension. It is difficult to conducting a comprehensive comparison. It must conduct a dimensionless treatment, that is, the indicator value to do standardization, regular treatment, in order to eliminate the unnecessary impact. In this article we mainly take a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola to describe the grade of membership of   indicators  2 0 min min    min max max min 1 max kk ij kk ij kkkk ij ij kk kk ij dd dd fd d d d dd dd              k ij d  refers to the actual value of the transport data max k d refers to the maximum value of K indicators in transport data min k d refers to the minimum value of K indicators in transport data.

China's overseas oil imports mainly from the Middle East, Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.

The results can be drawn from the following revelation  1  China's oil imports from overseas sources mainly in the Middle East and Africa region in 2006, the total share of 52% and 36.2 according to Table shows that we are in the process of importing oil should try to imported from the Middle East to China's the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta Southeast Asia focused on the import of routes assigned to the Pearl River Delta of China Guangdong\ion, so that can be considered under the premise of the risk factors to minimize the line distance, and reduce the traffic load pressure on the South China Sea   2  The choice of line in South America the country imported oil to the Bohai Sea region, because the main westbound line through the Panama Canal, the Japan Sea and the Bohai Bay will be shipped to China Bohai Sea Rim. On the one hand, westbound line can shorten transportation distance,  on the other hand ,it can avoid highrisk area such as the Malacca Strait and the Indian Ocean high piracy regions   3  In addition, from the distance-risk matrix can be seen max  86.75 ij C   in Table so ensure that the entire transportation lowest cost and risk situation, should focus on imports of South American line to strengthen the protection and controls of the line, as in South America is far  apart from the largest value and  the highest risk of  the line   4  From the data and results of this article can be seen, China's import of over-reliance on the Middle East, has exceeded the internationally recognized warning line of not more than 30 percent. Over-concentration of resources easily be imported by the country's political and social stability of the constraints, so we can expand the Caspian Sea region of Central Asia, as well as Russia, Kazakhstan and other pipeline transportation mode of development and utilization, achieve diversification strategy of oil imports and reduce oil-producing countries of political instability and regional conflicts to impacting on China's oil imports   5  C ONCLUSION   For overseas oil multi-objective transportation problems we use a fuzzy programming algorithm distributing in the partial big-scale parabola which will consider the distance, risk of overseas oil import to converted multiobjective into single-objective transportation problems Through the distance-risk matrix and improved table operation method to obtain the optimal compromise solution, providing basis for transportation routes decision making for China. In the course of the study there are still some areas for improvement, such as not comprehensive enough to consider the risk factors including the import of resources, political risk, the port's throughput ,handling capacity risk indicators should also be taken into account, some studies will be further improved  in the future  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by Natural Science Foundation of China \(70871038\novation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Comm ission\(09ZS65\d Nation Key Technology R&D Program of China\(2006BAB08B01 REFERENCES  1  GeneralAdministrationofCustoms:http://www.customs.gov.cn/pub lish/portal0 2  Carla Oliveira,Carlos Henggeler Antunes. çA multiple objective model to deal with economy-energy-environment interactions European Journal of  Operational Research Vol. 84, pp370385,2004

Memory Benchmarks We evaluated the memory performance using two benchmarks: a streaming copy benchmark and the random memory access benchmark from Section III The streaming copy benchmark is simple: it allocates a memory buffer, divides it in two, and copies data from one region to the other using PowerPC 450 parallel load/store instructions. The benchmark reports the theoretical peak memory performance if it is run in a noise-free environment The results for several different buffer sizes can be found in Table III. With a 16KB buffer size, which ?ts well in the L1 cache, all kernels perform equally well, because no TLB misses are caused by the benchmark even under standard Linux with 4KB pages. With larger buffers, such as 4MB \(which ?t in the L3 cache which do not ?t Linux kernel is signi?cantly lower than under CNK. Linux with Big Memory shows a 0.2% loss compared to CNK This is a small performance hit, but it is still larger than expected, given that the noise level has been measured at just 0.03% \(see Section III detailed investigation of this phenomenon, but we suspect that instruction cache thrashing at context switch time caused by the OS tick update might be responsible; the benchmark issues a series of parallel load/store instructions, and the cost of cache thrashing might be higher than for an FPU benchmark Table III STREAMING COPY BENCHMARK \(GB/S 16KB 4MB 256MB CNK 6.74 4.60 3.85 Linux 4KB 6.73 3.85 3.35 Linux 64KB 6.74 4.51 3.82 Linux Big Memory 6.74 4.59 3.84 In Section III, we showed the results of the random memory access benchmark on CNK and on Linux with paged memory; there was a large difference in performance Table IV adds the result for Linux with Big Memory support the gap to CNK is narrowed to 0.04%, or within the system noise level Table IV RANDOM MEMORY ACCESS BENCHMARK MB/s CNK 44.70 Linux 4KB 14.39 Linux 64KB 16.40 Linux Big Memory 44.68 B.

LOFAR Online Central Processing We had the opportunity to observe the performance of Big Memory in a real-life application. LOFAR is a radio telescope being built in the Netherlands [15]. In contrast to current radio telescopes that employ custom-built hardware as a correlator, LOFAR uses a Blue Gene/P supercomputer Our previous work discusses the LOFAR central processor in more detail [7], [16 LOFAR stations stream UDP/IP data directly into the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes at a rate of slightly more than 3Gbps These I/O nodes store the data in a main memory ring buffer which is used to absorb network delays or temporary hiccups in the processing pipeline. From here the data is transported to the compute nodes, where the information is correlated Poor main memory performance of the I/O node running the default Linux kernel proved to be one of the major bottlenecks in trying to achieve optimum data throughput Table VII shows a breakdown of the tasks on the Blue Gene/P I/O nodes running the LOFAR online processing application in a fairly standard 16-bit observation mode and a more challenging 4-bit mode. The required CPU resources in processor cores, are shown for the stock IBM I/O node kernel in the 16-bit mode and for a ZeptoOS compute node kernel, modi?ed to run on the I/O nodes, for both the 16bit and 4-bit modes. We see that using the original I/O node kernel would require almost two entire I/O node cores just to handle the ring buffer, and that there are not enough compute resources available to perform all the tasks in real time, even for the less demanding 16-bit mode We used a slightly modi?ed ZeptoOS compute node kernel, including support for the Ethernet device and excluding compute node speci?c devices like the torus network, on the I/O node. We reserved 1536MB of main memory as the Big Memory area and used it for the ring buffer using six 256MB TLB entries. The I/O node application was also adapted to copy 128 UDP/IP packets into the ring buffer at once, instead of one at a time. These two optimizations reduce the resources required to copy data into the ring buffer by more than 600%, about half of which can be attributed to the lack of TLB misses in the Big Memory area The more challenging 4-bit mode signi?cantly increases the potential number of TLB misses. Although limitations in the default kernel make direct comparison impossible smallscale memory benchmarks show a more than 500 reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when 


reduction in required CPU cycles using Big Memory when copying UDP/IP packets one by one Clearly, the access pattern of the LOFAR I/O node application is very susceptible to performance hits caused by TLB misses. With the stock I/O node kernel, the processor was unable to achieve our throughput requirements. Preventing TLB misses for at least part of the application, combined with several other optimizations not discussed here, allowed us to reduce CPU load considerably, increasing I/O node performance to well beyond our original requirements Table VII LOFAR I/O NODE PROCESSING \(#CORES Stock ZeptoOS 16 bit 16 bit 4 bit Receive UDP/IP packets 1.44 1.44 1.22 Copy data to ring buffer 1.80 0.27 0.37 Send ring buffer to CN 1.40 0.52 0.61 Receive data from CN 1.00 0.10 0.35 Send results to storage 0.40 0.32 0.64 Total system load 151% 66.5% 79.7 VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the implementation of Big Memory support for BG/P Linux  a transparent, ?at memory space for computational processes. Big Memory addresses two major issues encountered when attempting to run highperformance code on the BG/P Linux: poor memory performance caused by TLB misses handled in software, and the dif?culties of writing an ef?cient communication stack caused by the limitations of the BG/P torus  DMA engine Our experiments have shown that benchmarks running under a standard Linux kernel with paged memory can run up to three times slower than under CNK. With Big Memory support, Linux is slower by only 0.03  0.2%. We think that the 0.03% loss is due to the time spent executing the OS tick interrupt handler; with some benchmarks this can grow to 0.2%, presumably because of instruction cache thrashing With further kernel tuning, it should be possible to reduce the noise level to close to zero. Experiments at scale showed a slowdown of well under 1 71 Employing Big Memory on the I/O nodes was instrumental in reducing the I/O node CPU resources required for LOFAR online central processing. A 500  600% performance increase was observed in key parts of the application allowing the I/O nodes to achieve their required throughput Our modi?cations to the Linux kernel are relatively small principally because we focused exclusively on the requirements of computational processes, rather than trying to solve the problem in a generally applicable way, which would have been far more complicated. We maintain two versions of Linux kernel, and we found porting the Big Memory patches between the kernels to be straightforward Contemporary parallel architectures such as Blue Gene/P Cray XT5, and Roadrunner use commodity CPUs such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, or IBM PowerPC, instead of designs dedicated to computational environments. The memory management units in these processors are essentially designed to support a highly multitasking environment. It would be interesting if future designs had hardware support for computational process address space similar to the Big Memory area that we implemented, to allow for a seamless coexistence of high-performance applications and standard Unix processes on the compute nodes Along with the Big Memory implementation, we conceived the idea of a special process that the kernel treats differently from other processes. In the case of Big Memory the kernel creates a different application address space, and we showed that this idea works for compute nodes. We have also experimented with other uses of this feature, such as disabling nonessential interrupts when a computational process gets scheduled in order to reduce the system noise Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking 


Our current implementation is suitable for benchmarking and simple applications. We need to make several improvements in the quality of implementation, such as the granularity of the Big Memory area. So far, we have had little experience with running large, real-world applications on the compute nodes using our modi?ed kernel; this area will be explored as part of our future research Acknowledgments: We thank IBM  s Todd Inglett Thomas Musta, Thomas Gooding, George Alma  si, Sameer Kumar, Michael Blocksome, and Robert Wisniewski for their advice on programming the Blue Gene hardware.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
