It is a subject of great importance \nthat how operation and maintenance system of cloud service \nenables public cloud to maximize effectiveness, guarantee high-\nquality and high-reliability experience for users at the stage of \nenterprise operation. The paper proposes an peration and \nmaintenance system for public cloud, including the architecture, \nthe organization structure and the personnel input of cloud \nservice operation and maintenance And a complete operation \nand maintenance system is described in detail from several \naspects such as the process, operation and maintenance tools and \nevaluation system. \nKeywords—cloud computing; public cloud operation and \nmaintenance \nI. INTRODUCTION\nCloud computing is a brand-new Internet application mode \nwith an ultimate goal to provide the public with computing, \nservice and application as a public facility, enabling users can \nuse computer resources in the same way that they use water \nand electricity. The basic principle of cloud computing is to \ndistribute computing on a large number of distributed \ncomputers, thus strong computing capacity and unlimited \nstorage space could be provided to users [1-4]. Through cloud \ncomputing, enterprises can centralize IT resources, provide \nquantifiable computing and storage service according to needs \nof users improve utilization rate of IT resources and reduce \nsystem cost. Cloud computing is becoming a development ntrend and will bring about a tremendous revolution to the \ntraditional IT industry. \nAccording to the deployment and access mode, cloud \ncomputing can be divided into public cloud, private cloud and \nhybrid cloud. The public cloud is regarded as the main type of \ncloud computing and its development is enjoying a great \nmomentum now. Public cloud serves individual users and \ngroup users publicly, including both traditional delivery service \nof network content and more new applications \(such as \ndatabase service computing service, leasing service of virtual \ncomputing resources and application software service, etc nFor users, the programs, services and relevant data are stored \nby public cloud providers. Users can get access to services \nsimply by configuring the virtual private resources in public \ncloud, without making relevant investment, construction and \nmaintenance of IT infrastructure.  \nOperation and maintenance system is an effective support \nsystem of public cloud, able to provide guarantee of service \nquality and service security for public cloud. In the architecture \nof cloud computing technology system, it provides full-life ncircle operation and maintenance of IaaS layer, PaaS layer and \nSaaS layer resources, realizes centralized management of \nphysical resources and virtual resources and provides end-to-\nend integrated management capabilities [5-8] such as resource \nmanagement, statistics, monitoring scheduling and service \ncontrol. The operation and maintenance of cloud computing is \ndifferent from that of traditional IT mainly in terms of resource \npooling.  \nII. ARCHITECTURE OF CLOUD OPERATION AND \nMAINTENANCE SYSTEM\nResource pool of cloud computing system is planned and \ndeployed in a unified way, and shared by each business \nplatform. The original vertical and decentralized maintenance \nmode evolves into a transverse and centralized maintenance nmode. After resource pool built in a centralized way, the \nhardware level \(including server, shared storage and network \nequipment, etc including virtual \nsoftware, virtual management software and cloud management \nplatform, etc Characteristics of operation and maintenance of cloud \ncomputing platform \nFor cloud operation and maintenance, the complexity and \ninnovativeness of cloud computing platform is a brand-new \nchallenge resulting in the changes in ideas and ways of \noperation and maintenance. Compared with traditional website noperation and maintenance, the operation and maintenance of \ncloud computing platform has the main characteristics below.  \n Cluster is basic unit of operation and maintenance. All \nnodes of cloud computing platform are common PC \nservers, and the high availability of platform is no \nlonger achieved by adopting high-investment server \nhardware redundancy scheme \(RAID, network double \nconnection and double power supply etc Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.84\n8430 9 4 31 4\nO\nA\n netw\nrok\nD\nC\nN\n netw\nrok\nFig.1. Architecture of operation and maintenance system of cloud service ncalls for a different approach that the basic unit for \noperation and maintenance should be transformed from noriginal server to cluster. Servers are repaired “in time” \nin traditional operation and maintenance 


scenarios, but \n“easily” and regularly repaired in cloud computing \nscenarios based on the management capability of \noverall capacity and health state of clusters \(i.e. the \ncapability of reflecting the overall state of clusters by \nrefining and filtering the individual operating state of \nvarious servers effectively without reducing the \nrequirements of operation and maintenance. The \noperation and maintenance tasks such as capacity \nmanagement, deployment, monitoring and fault \nmanagement must be conducted in cluster.  \n Large scale. The scale of single cluster is one of \nimportant indicators to measure the capability of cloud ncomputing platform. For production environment, only \nafter the cloud computing clusters are developed to a ncertain scale, the true values of computing platform \nsuch as high availability and low cost, etc. can be nrealized. Therefore, the planning and realization of \noperation and maintenance should satisfy the necessary ncondition of large scale.  \n Maintainability. Maintainability is the basic attribute of \ncloud platform and the must-have ability of cluster. \nThe maintainability of cluster involves several \noperation and maintenance tasks such as efficient and \nlarge-scale deployment, upgrading, migration, \nexpansion and fault management The achievement of \nmaintainability must consider cloud platform and the \ncharacteristics of operation and maintenance, with the \nclose cooperation of development team and operation \nand maintenance team. Compared with traditional \noperation and maintenance, maintainability and \nmanageability are rigid requirements for cluster \ndeployment, hence cloud platform has very high \nrequirements for maintainability and manageability of nlarge-scale cluster. \n Standardization. In the environment of large-scale \nclusters, the management like deployment, migration \nand expansion of cluster relies on the standardization \nof overall planning from IDC design, network design \nand server selection to realization of cloud platform. \nStandardization constitutes the important “One \nInfrastructure” attribute of cloud computing. Based on \nthe realization of “One Infrastructure”, a batch of \nservers is moved from cluster A to cluster B by \nperforming a remote re-allocation on the cluster \nmanagement system, without the need for actual \nrelocation of physical servers nB. Architecture of operation and maintenance system of cloud \nservice\nIn the era of cloud, service system is a large-scale system \ncomposed of virtual facilities for the building of applications \nand network engines Cloud service provider needs to define \noperation and maintenance strategies based on dynamic \nallocation of virtual resources, standardize allocation according \nto the introduced policy template and maintain consistency \namong vertical machines.  \nAs shown in Fig. 1, in the architecture of operation and \nmaintenance system of cloud service, the operation and \nmaintenance of cloud service is mainly divided into that of nservice management domain, resource management domain, \noperation management domain, in which each domain can be \ncomposed of multiple function modules.  \n 1 login and user desktop  \n Service catalog: Service catalog creation, examination \nand approval, release modification, deletion and \noffline  \n Service instance: Service application, examination and \napproval generation, creation, activation, suspension, \nmodification, logout and inquiry  \n85\n2 domain \n Assets management: Assets information management \nand assets topology management  \n Resource encapsulation: Automatic discovery of assets, \nresource management, resource topology management, \nresource pool management and API interface  \n Resource template: Template management and \nmirroring management  \n Deployment scheduling: Policy management and \nresource deployment  \n3 management: User group management, user \nmanagement, role management and rights management  \n Security management: Certification authority, \ncertificate management, security policy and log \nmanagement \n Billing network management: Billing allocation, billing \ninformation collection and Bill format conversion  \n Monitoring alarm: Service instance monitoring, \nphysical resource monitoring, resource pool \nmonitoring, user connection monitoring, software \nmonitoring, alarm management and monitoring view  \n Problem management problem collection and problem \nhandling  \nIII. ANALYSIS OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE \nORGANIZATION STRUCTURE OF CLOUD SERVICE\nIn the circumstances of traditional network technology, the \nbusinesses of telecom operator are attached to the networks, \nnamely one type of business is hosted in some specific network. \nNetwork involves multiple special networks like switching, \ndata, value-added business platform, and each special network \nis divided into different levels. Therefore, the operation and \nmaintenance organization is set in two ways: 1 organization \(i.e. according to network network management nlevel, network maintenance level and on-site maintenance \nlevel technology, network \nis developing toward large-capacity, flat and centralized \nnetworking while network monitoring management is also \nevolving towards the centralized and integrated monitoring \nmanagement. Telecom operators are transforming into \ninformation service providers gradually when business and \nnetwork are developing from binding, decentralizing and \npartitioning to layering and integration. These factors drive the 


noperation and maintenance to evolve in six directions. \n From equipment orientation to service orientation n From decentralized maintenance to centralized and \nhighly-centralized maintenance.  \n Operation and maintenance is becoming scientific, \nstandardized, automated and informational.   \n Operation and maintenance organization is set and \nbuilt flatly.  \n From guarantee of QoS to guarantee of QoE. \n Strengthen process management and improve \noperation and maintenance efficiency. \nA. Organization structure of operation and maintenance of \ncloud service \nOperation and maintenance of cloud service should adopt \nreasonable and efficient organization structure of IT operation \nand maintenance so as to achieve process-oriented service nmanagement with customer satisfaction and service quality at \nthe core, and adapt to management needs in different operation \nand maintenance modes. Under general circumstances, IT \noperation and maintenance organization is composed of \noperation and maintenance leadership working team and \noperation and maintenance execution working team.   \nVirtual equipment\n1 n\n...\nMaintenance\nBusiness \nplatform \nmainten-\nance unit\nNetwork \nmanage-\nment \ncenter\nCloud platform \nmaintenance team\nHardware equipment \nlayer\nCloud hardware nmaintenance team\nMaintenance\nMaintenance\nMaintenance \nmanagementVirtual layer \(including \nmanagement platform business ndepartment of maintenance\nFunction \nmanagement \nunit\nTechnical \nsupport \nunit\nFig.2. Organization structure of operation and maintenance of cloud \nplatform \nResponsible person of the leadership team should be the ninformationization director of the organization while the \nmembers of the leadership team should be leaders or \nrepresentatives with decision-making rights from the business \ndepartment and informationization department. If an \noutsourcing mode is adopted, the leadership team should also \ninclude representatives of operation and maintenance service \nproviders. Members of the execution team should be personnel \nfrom the informationization department of the organization. If \nan outsourcing mode is adopted, the execution team should \nalso include personnel from IT operation and maintenance \nservice provider who participate in operation and maintenance.     \nThe components of organization structure correspond to \nroles of IT operation and maintenance activity, in which, \noperation and maintenance leadership working team \ncorresponds to IT operation and maintenance service manager \nwhile operation and maintenance execution working team \ncorresponds to IT operation and maintenance service provider \nand user.\nIn the organization structure of operation and maintenance \nof cloud service, division of maintenance work of cloud \nplatform is given below. \n86\n Maintenance management of cloud platform is in the \ncharge of network management center. \n Business management department takes charge of \noperation and management of the businesses hosted on \ncloud platform n Maintenance of cloud platform is in the charge of \n“monitoring analysis room”.  \n Management and maintenance of equipment room of \ncloud is in the charge of the unit which owns the \nequipment room.  \n Maintenance of business platform hosted on cloud \nplatform is in the charge of relevant maintenance unit naccording to existing division mechanism of \nmaintenance duties.  \nB. Personnel input of cloud service nResource management of cloud computing service covers \nextensive scopes, including environmental management nnetwork management, equipment management, software \nmanagement, storage medium management, anti-virus nmanagement, application management, routine operation \nmanagement, user password management and staff nmanagement, etc. In the operation and maintenance of cloud \nservice, the scope of routine maintenance work like operation \ncontents, maintenance frequency and corresponding \nresponsible person objects should be defined \nso that there are rules to follow, responsible person can track \nand the full-life circle tracking management of the whole \nsystem can be achieved. \n1 maintenance management \nResponsible for managing technical standard and codes of \ncloud platform, planning and managing the functions and \ncapabilities of cloud platform, and resource operation analysis, \netc. \nb monitoring  \nResponsible for monitoring the physical/virtual equipment \n\(including various resources like computing, storage and \nnetwork information of cloud management platform \nwith the tools like cloud management platform, virtual \nmanagement software and centralized network management. \nc maintenance of \ncloud platform, working out routine operation plan and \nexecuting the plan strictly.  \n Responsible for allocation, activation and recycling, \netc. of cloud resources according to work order of nresource application. \n Responsible for optimization, upgrading and expansion, \netc. of cloud platform.  \n Responsible for conducting dynamic monitoring \nmanagement of resources of and fault handling, etc. of \ncloud platform.  \n Responsible for itinerant inspection of the physical \nequipment \(network, computing and storage and \nvirtual resources of resource pool and submitting \noperation analysis report. \n Responsible for maintaining and updating relevant \narchival data of cloud platform. \n2

ANALYSIS OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SYSTEMS \nAND PROCEDURES OF CLOUD SERVICE\nThe management procedures of IT operation and \nmaintenance service involves service desk, event management, \nproblem management, configuration management, change \nmanagement, release management, service level management, \nfinancial management, capability management, availability \nmanagement service continuity management, knowledge \nmanagement and supplier management, etc. As operation and nmaintenance activities evolves further and are improved \ncontinuously, other processes may be independent and nstandardized gradually.  \nTelecom operator has three types of core process: \(1 2 3 FAB and is a part of operation and maintenance \ncapability system. The core processes are the foundation of nstructuring of enterprise organization, essence in operation and \nfoothold of improving core competitiveness nTelecom operators realize production centralization through \nmodern operation and maintenance system achieve network \noperation integration through process construction and \nintegrate network operation and network service into the whole \nprocess of operation, production and service. In the evolution \nprocess of operation and maintenance system, it is necessary to \nstudy the connection between processes in the new system and \noriginal processes.  \n1 the whole \nprocess from business launch to business realization, involving \nthe links like exploration construction, scheduling and \nactivation as well as the departments like planning department, \nnetwork construction department, network maintenance \ndepartment and business marketing department, and even \ninvolves relevant manufacturers. Therefore, the factors like \ncost effectiveness, business protocol, reasonable resource \nutilization and specific user requirements for business \nfulfillment, etc. should be taken into account, the quick-closing \nallocation process should be formed, business fulfillment time \nshould be shortened and the market response capability of \nnetwork resources should be improved.  \n2 guarantee process  \nAfter business is fulfilled, the business quality that satisfies \nthe customers should be able to ensure consistently. Business \nguarantee process involves routine guarantee of business, quick nrecovery processing in case of fault and coordination of \ncustomer relations. For routine guarantee of business, routine \ntest should be arranged based on business protocol and \ncustomer rating, and optimization and adjustment of electric \ncircuit should be arranged based on network changes. In case \nof fault, internal and external manpower and material resources \nshould be coordinated to confirm fault and recover business nquickly to placate the users through coordination. In case of \nmajor fault, the work like user notification and public relation \nwork via media should be done.  \nThe operation and maintenance service system built based non ITIL covers the processes like allocation management, \nevent management and problem management and ensures nstandardization of service management, thus guaranteeing \nservice quality. \n Set up service team to provide on-site maintenance for \nkey branch nodes 5 days a week, 8 hours a day.  \n Provide on-site attention or remote support for \nimportant business system 7 days a week, 24 hours a \nday.  \n Service respond and accepttance through channels like \nhotline, email and work order, etc.  \nService guarantee includes the following processes: routine \nmonitoring, periodic itinerant inspection, service acceptance, \nfault handling platform maintenance, configuration \nmanagement, security management, operation and maintenance \nimprovement resource management, emergency exercise, \nchange management and operation and maintenance report. \na

Resource operation and change process  \n89\nV. ANALYSIS OF CLOUD SERVICE OPERATION AND \nMAINTENANCE TOOLS\nIT operation and maintenance has transformed from manual \nmanagement to computer management now, but most of IT \noperation and maintenance is in the “semi-automatic” state. For \ntraditional IT operation and maintenance, operation and \nmaintenance personnel take relevant measures only after IT \nfault occurs, so the traditional passive, isolated and semi-\nautomatic IT operation and maintenance mode always makes \nIT department exhausted. Enterprises shall realize automatic \nmanagement of operation and maintenance by professional, \nstandardized and process-oriented means, so IaaS platform \nshould be managed with effective IT operation and \nmaintenance tools. The tools shall be “cloudified” so as to \nadapt to the cloud-based modes methods and standards of IT \noperation and maintenance.  \nA perfect operation and maintenance system includes nsystem preparation module, configuration management module \nand monitoring alarm module. \n System preparation: Automatic installation of \noperation system and common software package. \n Configuration management: Automatic deployment of \nbusiness system software package and configuration, \nremote server management \(switch service, etc availability, \nperformance and security, sending alarm information \nto administrator.  \nAccording to different functions, the operation and \nmaintenance tools can be divided into preparation tools, \nconfiguration tools and monitoring alarm tools as below. \n1 Linux \noperation system and software. They can be used to do some \nrough configuration work with the software package system \nsuch as rpm or apt on the server. \n2 management tools can deploy common \napplication programs automatically, set parameters or activate \nservice on a new server, and also be used to roll back change \nmanagement of operation system and business support system nto the previous version.  \n3 ngenerating the report on availability, performance and other \nsystem states. Availability monitoring can send an alarm of \nbusiness unavailability to operation and maintenance personnel \nimmediately so as to handle the alarm immediately and reduce \nbusiness interruption time. \nTABLE I.

In \ngeneral, quality indicators of various IT operation and \nmaintenance service include but not limited to:  \na non-conformance report and missing rate \nof non-conformance report. \nb timely completion \nof maintenance plan, discovery rate of fault and hidden danger, \nactive discovery rate of non-conformance, satisfaction rate of \ntimely fault service request, satisfaction rate of timely business nservice request and solving rate of problem, etc.  \nc nservice response, rate of timely arrival at the scene and rate of \ntimely fault repair.   \nd management service: coverage rate of \nvulnerability scanning, rate of timely presentation of security \nreport quantity of the missing security vulnerabilities, missing \nrate of security vulnerabilities, coverage rate of strengthening \nequipment, rate of timely installation of security patch, times of \nsecurity events, etc.\ne Network access service: average response time and \nsolving rate of problem, etc. \nf service: retrieval success rate and \ntimely response rate, etc. \ng response time \nand problem resolution rate, etc.  \nVII. CONCLUSION \nCloud operation and maintenance is oriented towards the \nallocation, scheduling and monitoring, etc. of different cloud \nresources. The paper introduced the complete operation and \nmaintenance system of public cloud, including architecture of noperation and maintenance system, organization structure, \nsystem and process analysis, tool analysis and evaluation \nsystem, etc., providing a system-level reference for actual \noperation and management of public cloud. It is an inevitable \ntrend that cloud computing replaces existing enterprise IT \nsystem. Great attention must be paid to operation and \nmaintenance issues of cloud computing, if the maximum \neffectiveness of cloud computing is expected to be generated \ncompletely.  \n90\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

the end of each\nsampling window. The experimental results are shown in Fig.6\nand Fig.7.\nFig.6 shows the runtime status of FVUC, FUC, FVC and\nOPEN with the RMS/S configuration. In Fig.6 \(a FVUC converges to 54% and does not change\nsince the 4th sampling window, while the utilization fluctuate\naround 65%, which is above than the set-point 60%. In the\nfurther analysis, we find both the utilization and vulnerability\nexceed their set-points, which means under the configuration\nRMS/S, it is impossible to maintain a high security as well as\nforce the utilization lower than the set-point. This is because\nthe computation resources are not enough. In this situation,\nFVUC makes a balance between the low utilization and low\nvulnerability, and tries to provide a better overall performance.\nIn contrast, the FUC \(in Fig.6\(b vul-\nnerability \(nearly 60 in Fig.6\(c stabilizes in 50%, the\nutilization fluctuate around 70%, which obviously violates the\nset-point. From these two mechanisms, it is clear that either\nFUC or FVC cannot make a balance between utilization and\nvulnerability, and it can only realize the dynamic control in\none direction. If one performance metric, no matter utiliza-\ntion or vulnerability, meets its set-point, another metric will\nbe far away from its desired value. OPEN \(in Fig.6\(d low. Hence, too many computation resources\n127\n \(a b c d n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 7.

However,\nif consider the utilization and vulnerability at the same time\nand then calculate the performance function \(in Eq.7 better. The utilization bound of RMS is de-\npended on the number of scheduled tasks \(as in Eq.8 theoretical value is 74% when there are 5 five tasks. Com-\nparing with the average utilization of FVUC and FVC, even\nthough higher than the set-point, the actual utilization is still\nlower than the bound. So it is safe to say the real-time con-\nstraint can be guaranteed in FVUC and FVC. This is the rea-\nson to explain why we set the set-point a little lower than the\ntheoretical bound [12] [15].\nFig.7 illustrates the simulation results when the configura-\ntion is EDF/M. In this situation, The run-time status of FVUC\n\(in Fig.7\(a close to our expected, in which the utilization\nfluctuates between 90% and 100% as well as the vulnerability\nmaintains at the 80%. Both these two metrics are higher than\nthe set-points, which is decided by the limited resources can-\nnot provide the enough computation capacity. The FUC \(in\nFig.7\(b similarly to FVUC expect it converges to the\nset-point a little slower. For only the Utilization Controller is\ndeployed, FUC increases the vulnerability to save some com-\nputation capacity, and these saved resources can help to reduce\nthe utilization, and to provide a stronger guarantee of real-time\nrequirement. The performance of FVC \(in Fig.7\(c re-\nduced vulnerability makes the execution times of tasks become\nbigger, and finally leads the utilization always stays nearly at\n100%. Both the performances of FVC and FUC prove the\nconclusion again, that a single controller design approach is\nnot suitable when there are multiple metrics should be consid-\nered. OPEN verifies the EDF/M configuration is available in\nthis experiment. It shows there are indeed some resources can\nbe used to provide some security protections.\nTABLE III\nPerformance comparison with EDF/M configuration\n\(Fixed Period 20.9\nFUC 90.6% 78.2% 42.0\nFVC 99.0% 73.4% 51.6\nThe statistics data is shown in TABLE III. The overall per-\nformance of FVUC is 100% higher than FUC and 150% than\nFVC. This performance improvement is more than in TABLE\nII. From this Experiment I, we can make some conclusions\nhere.\n1. The more heavier of the scheduled tasks set is, the ad-\nvantage of our FVUC more obvious. If the provided com-\nputational resource is totally enough, no matter which\nmechanism applied, the FUC, FVC, or FVUC, the vul-\nnerability and utilization can be guaranteed to maintain\nthe set-points.\n2. Since two controllers deployed, the algorithm in FVUC\nis more complicated, but this complexity is worth to im-\nprove the overall performance.\nB. Experiment II: Varying Period\nFig.8 illustrates the runtime status of FVUC, FVC and FUC\nwith RMS/S configuration. In this set of 


experiments, we\nwant to verify the system performance of FVUC, FUC and\nFVC when the period of scheduling tasks varies in the runtime.\nBefore this test, we define the overloaded windows from the\n40th to 80th sampling window. During this time, tasks’ period\nwill increase 30% in RMS/S configuration, and 10% in EDF/M\nconfiguration.\nFirstly, we compare the performance of FVUC \(in Fig.8\(a in Fig.8\(b overloaded windows, we find an\ninteresting phenomenon that the vulnerability in FUC rapidly\nincreases near 30%, while the utilization fluctuates more dra-\nmatically. On the contrary, the changes of utilization and\nvulnerability in FVUC are mild. In the further analysis, we\nmust admit that the FUC has a stronger ability to guaran-\ntee the real-time performance, because even when the period\nof tasks becomes smaller, the actual utilization is still lower\nthan the schedulable bound \(76 are unstable at these overloaded\nwindows. The setting of controllers’ parameter is from the\nZiegler-Nichols method, which is based on the practical, not\ntheoretical analysis. When tasks’ characteristic happens to\nchange, those setting parameters cannot guarantee the sta-\nbility any more. Hence, although the theoretical analysis is\n128\n \(a b c n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 8.

The advantage of FVS is to provide\nthe strongest security protection, but the shortcoming is the\nreal-time being highly ignored.\nTABLE IV\nPerformance comparison with RMS/S configuration\n\(Varying Period 61.7% 279.6\nFUC 60.5% 74.1% 350.9\nFVC 91.0% 50.1% 523.2\nThe statistics of these overloaded windows in shown in TA-\nBLE IV. Note we calculate the average value of performance\nfunction only in the overloaded window. The overall perfor-\nmance of FVUC is 20% higher than FUC, which is not very\nobvious but still acceptable. In the further analysis, we find\nthe average utilization of FVUC is 78.9%, which is above than\nthe utilization bound and far more than it in FUC. The error\nof average utilization in FVUC and FUC is even close to 20%.\nHence, it must be careful to deploy the FVUC in real-time\nsensitive system. Although FVS has a lowest vulnerability,\nits utilization is too high to be acceptable in any real-time\nsystems.\nFig.9 is the runtime status of FVUC and FUC with EDF/M\nconfiguration. Both the FVUC and FUC have the similar be-\nhavior as in Fig.8. The statistic in TABLE V also shows the\nimprovement of our proposal. But clearly analyze the perfor-\nmance in overloaded windows, we can find that FVUC cannot\nto realize its function in utilization control. This is because\nthe maximum of utilization is 100% and the maximum error\nUS?U\(k k nIn this situation, the impact of vulnerability control is far more\nobvious than utilization control, and even leads the utilization\ncontrol failed. So, if the utilization set-point closes to 100%\nand overload is heavy, it is necessary to change the value of\nKIU and K\nP\nU to increase the influence of utilization control.\nTABLE V\nPerformance comparison with EDF/M configuration\n\(Varying Period 91.3\nC.

with the proportional controller, PI controller can help\nto guarantee the stability at the cost of increased computation\ncomplicity.\n129\n \(a b 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 10.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
