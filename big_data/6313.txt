Mining of EL GCIs Daniel Borchmann and Felix Distel Faculty of Computer Science TU Dresden Dresden Germany f borch,felix g tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de Abstract We consider an existing approach for mining general inclusion axioms written in a lightweight Description Logic In comparison to classical association rule mining this approach allows more complex patterns to be obtained Ours is the 002rst implementation of these algorithms for learning Description Logic axioms We use our implementation for a case study on two real world datasets We discuss the outcome and examine what further research will be needed for this approach to be 
applied in a practical setting Index Terms Description Logics General Inclusion Axioms I I NTRODUCTION Data mining has traditionally focused on the extraction of relatively simple rigid patterns from datasets For example in association rule mining the patterns are simple pairs of itemsets Their semantics is that transactions that contain the 002rst itemset also contain the second In this paper we implement and test an approach for mining a more complex and 003exible type of associations namely general concept inclusions GCIs that are written in the Description Logic DL EL  Our hope is that this combination of data mining and DL will be mutually bene\002cial for both 002elds 
Classical association rule mining requires a simple type of data where individuals or transactions have attributes or items associated with them In man y data sets there are also binary relations between individuals e.g there might be a relation linking two transactions if they have been performed by the same customer In another scenario the data may have been obtained from a social network and the binary relations are the various degrees of friendship among individuals Classical association rules cannot take these relations into account at least not natively Data mining and in particular social graph mining might bene\002t from the use of a language e.g a language from the DL family that is inherently capable of talking about binary relations Conversely DL might bene\002t from a data mining technique 
that can assist in the design of ontologies Ontology design can be a tedious and error-prone task It is usually done by domain experts who are not experts in logics By mining GCIs from existing data one could obtain a starting point for building an ontology Ideally the results of the mining process should be veri\002ed by a domain expert The work in this paper is based on an algorithm presented in  4 Ours is the 002rst impleme ntation of this algorithm The main purpose of this work is to serve as a prove of concept that mining GCIs can yield useful results Unlike algorithms for mining association rules which usually try to compute all possible association rules with suf\002cient support and con\002dence this algorithm only computes a compact representation of the GCIs a so-called 
base  This is necessary since even for a 002nite number of relations and attributes there are in\002nitely many possible EL GCIs We have chosen two datasets with different characteristics for testing our implementation The 002rst is an excerpt from DBpedia namely those indi viduals who either ha v e children or are someone's child As this dataset has been semiautomatically extracted from Wikipedia it contains relatively many errors Thus it can teach us valuable lessons on how the algorithm behaves on noisy and incomplete data Second we have used the DrugBank which is part of the Link ed Open Data Cloud It contains data about v arious drugs and their protein targets In comparison to DBpedia it is relatively free 
of errors We test the algorithm on both datasets and discuss the outcome The results reveal potential but they also give indications in what areas more research will be needed cf Section V The structure of the paper is divided as follows We start with a short introduction to EL and the mining algorithm This is followed by a description of our implementation and the two datasets We present some of our observations and 002nally discuss what lessons can be learned from them II T HEORETICAL F OUNDATIONS A The Description Logic EL EL is a lightweight Description Logic Although being 
relatively inexpressive compared to other DLs it has gained widespread acceptance e.g in biomedical ontologies 9 and within the latest OWL standard that contains the pro\002le OWL 2 EL EL s success is largely due to its favorable algorithmic properties We give an overview over the syntax of EL as well as an intuition for its semantics to the extent which is needed to understand this work For a more formal introduction to DL consider Lik e all Description Logics EL can be used to describe individuals and classes of individuals using concept descriptions  The main building blocks for 
concept descriptions are a set N C of concept names and a set N R of role names  Concept names e.g Parent  Child or FictionalCharacter  are themselves concept descriptions Role names describe relationships between individuals such as hasChild  createdBy  etc New concept descriptions can be

Homer Bart Person  Parent FictionalCharacter Person FictionalCharacter hasChild Fig 1 A Simple Model constructed using the constructors top    conjunction  u  and existential restrictions  9  If C and D are concept descriptions and r is a role name then C u D and 9 r:C are also concept descriptions For example the concept description Parent u FictionalCharacter 1 describes individuals that are both parents and 002ctional characters The description 9 hasChild  Parent 2 describes individuals with children who are themselves parents More formally the semantics of EL is based on models I  001 I  001 I   A model consists of a set 001 I called domain and a function 001 I mapping each concept name A to a subset A I 022 001 I and each role name r to a relation r I 022 001 I 002 001 I  The function 001 I can be extended recursively to map every concept description C to its interpretation C I by de\002ning  I  001 I   C u D  I  C I  D I and  9 r:C  I  f x 2 001 I j 9 y 2 C I   x y  2 r I g  Each model can be represented by a directed graph the so-called description graph of I  whose edges are labeled with a role name and whose nodes are labeled with sets of concept names as in Figure 1 In Figure 1 the description 1 is interpreted as f Homer g and as there are no grandparents in this model the description 2 is interpreted as the empty set Relationships between concepts can be expressed in the form of general concept inclusions GCIs These are statements of the form C v D where C and D are concept descriptions Consider for example Person u 9 hasChild   v Parent  3 which expresses that every person who has a child is a parent A GCI holds in a model if the interpretation of its left hand side is contained in the interpretation of its right hand side e.g the GCI from 3 holds in the model from Figure 1 because both sides have the interpretation f Homer g  A concept description C is more speci\002c than a concept description D if the GCI C v D holds in all possible models If B is a set of GCIs and C v D is another GCI then we say that C v D follows semantically from B if and only if in every model I in which all GCIs from B hold the GCI C v D holds as well Observe that ordinary association rules can be expressed as a simple form of GCIs where only conjunction and no existential restrictions are used An association rule stating that people who buy cereals and honey also buy milk could be expressed as BuyerOfCereal u BuyerOfHoney v BuyerOfMilk  EL GCIs are more expressive whenever relations exist between individuals In such a situation an in\002nite number of concepts can be described using EL Usually only a fraction of them will be interesting in practice Therefore we have tested our approach only on datasets where relations between individuals exist The two datasets used in this work are presented in Section III B The Basic Mining Algorithm We provide an overview of the theory that is involved It is described in detail in 4 In con v entional association rule mining there is only a 002nite number of items and therefore only a 002nite number of rules When using EL GCIs to describe associations this is no longer the case as it allows for nesting of existential restrictions causing a blowup Even worse the number of possible concept descriptions grows faster than exponential with the number of nestings the so-called role depth  Hence even with a restricted role depth we cannot expect to enumerate all associations that hold in the data in reasonable time Instead we enumerate a base of the EL GCIs holding in the data i.e a set B of GCIs such that 017 all GCIs from B hold in the model and 017 all GCIs that hold in the model follow semantically from B  In 4 a 002rst algorithm for computing a 002nite base from a given dataset is presented Its main purpose is knowledge base completion and as a knowledge base completion algorithm it competes with other methods e.g 12 Here we emplo y it in a slightly different setting where no knowledge base but a large dataset is initially present The algorithm proceeds in two steps First since it is impossible to consider all possible EL concept descriptions a 002nite set of relevant concept descriptions is obtained from the data using a technique called model-based most speci\002c concepts For a given model I and a set X 022 001 I the concept description C is called the model-based most speci\002c concept of X if it is the most speci\002c concept description that still satis\002es X 022 C I  The model-based most speci\002c concept of X is denoted by X I  The set of relevant concept descriptions is then obtained as M I  N C  f9 r:X I j X 022 001 I g  In it is sho wn that the GCIs where both sides are conjunctions of these relevant concept descriptions already form a base B  This base usually contains a large number of redundancies Lemma 1 The set of GCIs B  f C v  C I  I j C 2 R I g where R I  f d U j U 022 M I g is a base for the model I  Whenever only conjunctions occur in a GCI its semantics become simpler This allows the use of established theories to further reduce the size of B  In the second step of the algorithm this is done using a mathematical theory called Formal Concept Analysis FCA FCA uses a data structure

called formal contexts  A formal context K is de\002ned to be a triple K   G M I  where G is a set of objects M is a set of attributes and I 022 G 002 M is a binary relation Pseudointents are subsets of M with certain special properties and that can be used to characterize the implicational theory of a formal context cf for a formal de\002nition Using an algorithm from FCA called Next-Closure  pseudo-intents can be computed A smaller base B 0 can be obtained using the following result from Lemma 2 Let I be a model and K I  001 I  M I  I  be the context where I is de\002ned to contain the pair  x C  iff x 2 C I  The set of GCIs B 0  010 l P v  l P  I  I j P pseudo-intent of K I 011 is a base for the model I  Given K I as input Next-Closure successively returns new GCIs or more precisely their left hand sides however the delay between two GCIs can be exponentially large It has been a longstanding problem in FCA whether improvements to Next-Closure can be made yet no breakthrough has been achieved so far It can be shown that B 0 has minimal cardinality among all bases of the EL GCIs holding in a given dataset Notice that the algorithm will only compute GCIs that hold in a given dataset In data mining terminology one could say it computes associations with con\002dence 1 The reasons for this and its implications will be discussed in Section IV-C C Modi\002cations to the Basic Algorithm The basic algorithm described above consists of two parts 002rst the relevant concept descriptions are computed and then Next-Closure is used to obtain the basis During the 002rst step a long delay can occur during which no output is produced To avoid this a modi\002cation to the basic algorithm is suggested in where rele v ant concept descriptions are computed on the 003y i.e during the execution of Next-Closure Our implementation uses this modi\002ed approach Models that occur in practice can be cyclic i.e the graph that represents them is not a tree or forest In this case the existing strategy for obtaining the relevant concept descriptions does not work when EL is used This makes it necessary to use an extension of EL namely the DL EL gfp that allows for cyclic concept descriptions Using EL gfp the cycles in the model can be mirrored within the concept descriptions In this work one of the models DBpedia contains cycles while the other does not III D ESCRIPTION OF D ATA U SED We have implemented the EL exploration algorithm prototypically as part of a larger program called conexp-clj  which has been developed for Formal Concept Analysis The implementation language is Clojure a dialect of Lisp running on the Java Virtual Machine The implementation itself provides an abstract handling of Description Logics and interpretations and allows for the examination of properties of the algorithm Not necessarily is it designed for performance Nevertheless some optimizations ideas have been implemented and evaluated The descriptions of these requires more technical insight into the algorithm and is therefore out of the scope of this paper For details see We have tested the algorithm on two different data sets of different quality and size In the next two subsections we describe these two data sets and how they have been constructed from data from the Linked Open Data Cloud A Child-Relation in DBpedia The 002rst data set has been extracted from data from the DBpedia project The aim of this project is to automatically extract relational data from Wikipedia infoboxes The data snapshot from March 2011 which has been used for our experiments contains over 10 million RDF triples To handle them all at once is out of the scope of our capabilities yet Instead we have chosen a small subset of the data to construct an EL model for our experiments To this purpose we have used two data sets of RDF triples from the DBpedia one containing relations between individuals and the other containing instances of certain classes We then chose the role http://dbpedia.org/ontoloy/child and collected all RDF triples from the relational data set labeled with this relation The individuals which appeared in these collected triples formed the base set 001 DB for our model Then the concept names were chosen from the data set containing the instances Here all those classes have been chosen which had at least one instance in 001 DB  In sum this procedure resulted in an EL model I DB containing 5626 individuals one role relation and 60 concept names As we shall see later this model has some odd properties which are due to numerous errors in the DBpedia data sets First of all the child relation we have chosen proves to be cyclic in this interpretation Furthermore the relation does not exist between persons alone but also between authors and their work or even between persons and places Those errors are mostly owed to the nature of Wikipedia's infoboxes which are not standardized in any way Thus the data collected by the DBpedia project has to be normalized in certain ways and often enough errors occur We shall see later what consequences this has for our algorithm and the computed results B DrugBank As another data set from the Linked Open Data Cloud we have chosen the DrugBank and Diseasome 16 data sets They provide information about drugs their possible disease targets and information about genes that are in\003uenced by given drugs Three different roles occur in the datasets namely isSubtypeOf between diseases describing an is-a relation treatedBy from diseases to drugs and targets from drugs to protein sequences being affected by the given drug In contrast to the DBpedia model we construct the concept names for this model by looking at certain RDF triples More precisely we collect the RDF triples named with

concepts must be unsatis\002able This results in a large number of GCIs of the form d C 2 A C v All  Furthermore all drugs in the DrugBank have a target yielding GCIs of the form d C 2 A C v 9 target    In total about 1700 GCIs of these two forms were found Among the more interesting GCIs relatively few were of role depth 0 one example is tRNA processing v RNA processing u Metabolism u Physiological process  Quite a large number of GCIs of role depth 1 are found such as MuscarinicAntagonists v 9 targets 000 Signal transduction u Cell communication u Cellular process 001 or more complex ones like Anti in\015ammatory LocallyApplied v Anti allergicAgents u AntiulcerAgent topical u 9 targets  000 Response to biotic stimulus u Defense response u Immune response u Response to stimulus 001 u 9 targets  000 Signal transduction u G protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway 001  Notice that in the second GCI the two existential restrictions really refer to two distinct targets one typically Interleukin 3  is responsible for an Immune response and another e.g Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor1  is responsible for Signal transduction  Unlike the DBpedia which is the result of a semiautomated process the DrugBank has been created by human experts Hence can be assumed to contain relatively few errors Therefore one could imagine that the results of the mining process form a good starting point for the construction of an ontology Ideally each of them should nevertheless be veri\002ed by an expert C Observations 1 Insuf\002cient or Noisy Data Two types of shortcomings in the data can affect the results of the mining First there may be incomplete data In such a situation there might be GCIs that one would not expect to hold but for which there is no counterexample present in the data Second noise or factual errors can cause the opposite problem There may be GCIs that one would expect to hold but the data contains a faulty counterexample Both of these problems occur in the DBpedia model while the DrugBank is relatively free of errors in comparison We present some examples from DBpedia to illustrate these issues Insuf\002cient Data One example for this issue is the GCI 8 This GCI holds in the model since no other person with an artist and a politician as children has a DBpedia entry Yet in reality such persons are nevertheless likely to exist Errors in the Data Among the output of the DBpediaExploration is the following fairly incomprehensible GCI Person u 9 child  020 Person u 9 child  000 Person u 9 child   Person u 9 child  9 child  Person u 9 child    001 021 v 9 child  020 Person u 9 child  000 Person u 9 child   Person u 9 child   Person u 9 child  9 child  Person  001 021 It roughly states that a fourth great-grandparent's second great-grandchild must be a person It is clearly true but unnecessarily complicated It occurs only because the much simpler GCI Person u 9 child   v 9 child  Person  9 from which it could be concluded is not among the output There is a whole range of false counterexamples that seemingly disprove 9 The individual named Bertolt Brecht is one such example Bertolt Brecht has two child successors Frank Banholzer and Stefan Brecht  Both are not instances of Person  It is surprising to see that this is not an exceptional counterexample as 1188 individuals in our DBpedia-model contradict 9 Some of these reveal even more oddities in the DBpedia largely due to incorrect use of the child relation For example the individual John Perkins the author has April 1982 as one of his children most likely because his real daughter was born in April 1982 Other examples include places as children and literary works as children of their authors Combinations of Errors and Insuf\002cient Data Among the output is the GCI Person u 9 child  020 Person u 9 child  000 Person u 9 child   Person u 9 child  Artist  001 021 u 9 child  020 Person u 9 child  000 Person u 9 child  9 child   Person u 9 child    001 021 v 000 C f C 021 Writer u 9 child C g 001 Just like 8 it has a complicated left hand side that is only satis\002ed by one individual namely Carol Ann Du\013y  the UK's poet laureate Hence it owes its existence to incomplete data What makes it even more odd is its right hand side The right hand side is an EL gfp concept description describing individuals whose child is a Writer whose child is a Writer  and so on in\002nitely This peculiar consequence is due to an error where both Carol Ann Du\013y and her husband are each labeled as their respective spouse's child  As we can see the combination of effects from incomplete and false data can lead to very undesirable artifacts Approaches for Dealing with Noise and Incompleteness A supervised approach for dealing with incomplete data has been examined in 4 Each of the ne wly found GCIs is presented to an expert who can accept it or reject it by providing a counterexample This method is quite sensitive

with respect to errors in the data It is suitable when the data can be assumed to be largely correct Since expert interaction is usually costly it should in most situations be applied on a limited scale or with restricted role depths The DrugBank appears to be a good application for this approach while DBpedia does not An approach that we would like to investigate in the future is by adapting the notions of support and con\002dence to GCIs For a more detailed discussion of this approach see Section V 2 The In\003uence of Roles One of the distinguishing features of the presented algorithm is the added expressivity provided by a DL language that can talk about roles in addition to concepts It also causes some new problems among the problem of cyclic roles To test the impact of cyclic roles on the overall behavior of the exploration we have extended both our DBpedia model and the DrugBank model with cyclic roles More precisely we have constructed a model I cycDB from the given DBpedia data sets in the same way as described in III-A but instead of only considering the child relation we also added the relation of having someone as mother or father The resulting model proved to be very hard to be explored Instead of the 4.5 hrs needed to explore the original model I DB  after three days of runtime only 1700 GCIs had been collected and the computation of the next GCI took over half an hour Furthermore due to the highly cyclic nature of I cycDB most of the resulting GCIs were very hard to understand and thus of very little value However things got even worse when we considered the relation interactsWith given in the DrugBank data set modeling the information which two drugs interact with each other Obviously this relation is highly cyclic but not symmetric due to some technical reasons If we add this relation to our model I drugs exploration gets unfeasible with our implementation The reason for this is that two drugs Bumetanide and Furosemide show up as two individuals for which a description graph has to be computed which represents the model based most speci\002c concept of both of them However both drugs are very similar and have a large number of other drugs they interact with resulting in a description graph of over 5 million vertexes Our prototypical implementation was not built to handle such large description graphs and therefore we could not conduct the exploration However before this large description graph appeared 6 GCIs had been collected one of which contained a non-trivial cyclic concept description as it's conclusion But this description was too large to be understandable showing that even when the exploration yields GCIs in this case the result might be of little value for the domain expert 3 Time and Space Behavior The time and space behavior may give insights into properties of the algorithm itself and we want to discuss our corresponding observations in this section For the exploration of the DBpedia-model they are depicted graphically in Figure 2 The time behavior of the exploration shows some kind of exponentially growing delay between the computation of two successive GCIs Since the FCA part of the implementation 0 0  2 0  4 0  6 0  8 1 1  2 1  4 001 10 4 0 500 1  000 Time in seconds GCIs found 0 0  2 0  4 0  6 0  8 1 1  2 1  4 001 10 4 40 60 80 100 Time in seconds Space in  of the available space Fig 2 Time and space behavior when exploring the DBpediamodel relies on the computation of pseudo intents in lexicographic order using Next-Closure this bottleneck can most likely not be avoided Unfortunately  our e xperiments indicate that the worst case might be very close to the average case in our application For the space behavior of our implementation concrete interpretations are much harder to make This is because of the Java Virtual Machine and its memory model on which the implementation runs on which is based on automatic garbage collection However from the description of the algorithm we can expect a very moderate memory consumption of the overall run of the exploration which should mostly be due to storing the generated GCIs All other operations involved might need some extra space but only for a short time This expectation can be seen from the graphical representation because of the appearance of stairs in the diagram showing the periods where the next GCI is searched for alternating with the periods of steep increase where other computations are performed The steep declines of the curve correspond to calls of the garbage collector and they show that in almost every case that 50 of the main memory could have been reclaimed further supporting our hypothesis that only a moderate number of memory is used Finally it is interesting to see that the calls to the garbage collector get less and less the longer the exploration runs This corresponds to the fact that it takes more and more time in average to compute the next GCI the longer the exploration runs

V F UTURE W ORK In the future two main issues should be addressed First we would like to investigate approaches to improve the quality of the output in particular in the case of incomplete or noisy data Second we want to improve on memory and space requirements A Improving the Quality of the Output One should not forget that the algorithms that are used here are mathematically proven to yield a sound and complete base of minimal cardinality for the dataset provided That means provided that the data is complete and error-free there is no room for improvement in terms of quality In practice we are unlikely to ever encounter perfect data Hence the question is how can the effects of poor data be mitigated In Section IV-C1 we have observed the two different types of in\003uence of incomplete data and faulty data In association rule mining these two problems are usually dealt with by introducing the measures of support and con\002dence  A nai v e translation of the support and con\002dence to the terminology of EL GCIs could look like this supp A v B   j  C u D  I j 001 I conf C v D   j  C u D  I j j C I j 10 The idea is that by searching only for GCIs with a certain minimal support one can mitigate the effects of incomplete data At the same time imposing a minimum on the con\002dence can limit the effects of noise in the data Several obstacles need to be overcome to make this approach work First we have argued that the large number of possible GCIs requires a compact representation e.g a base Now if A v B and B v C both have a con\002dence greater than 0.9 the GCI A v C  even though it follows from the 002rst two may have a con\002dence as low as 0.81 Hence imposing a lower limit on the con\002dence results in a set of GCIs that is no longer closed with respect to semantic deductions In such a situation computing a base is meaningless An obvious way to mend this is to consider both GCIs with suf\002cient con\002dence and support as well as all GCIs that follow semantically from them to be trustworthy This set of trustworthy GCIs has the necessary closure property but has not been researched theoretically An alternative approach is to look for other compact representations of the GCIs with suf\002cient support One might think of an analogous notion to frequent closed itemsets e.g frequent closed EL concept descriptions and Iceberg lattices We also need to address whether the naive translation of the classical notions of support and con\002dence really does what one intuitively expects it to As a toy example assume that a dataset about art is very incomplete containing only one Museum  the Louvre  but thousands of pieces of art that belong to the Louvre cf Figure 3 Clearly the GCI Museum v 9 hasLocation  FrenchCity  Mona Lisa Venus de Milo Louvre Paris Museum FrenchCity hasLocation ownedBy ownedBy    Fig 3 Classical Support is Counterintuitive which states that all museums are in a French city is no more trustworthy than the GCI 9 ownedBy  Museum v 9 ownedBy   9 hasLocation  FrenchCity   which states that something that is owned by a museum is owned by a museum in a French city While the 002rst GCI has very small support there is only one museum in the dataset the latter has very large support in the dataset there are thousands of pieces of art belonging to a museum Whether other notions of support are less counterintuitive needs to be investigated B Speeding Up the Mining Process In its current state the runtime and the memory requirements of our implementation leave plenty of room for improvement While it is unlikely that the bottleneck with respect to runtime that is presented by Next-Closure can be avoided completely there are some improvements that can be made There is hope that the introduction of a concept constructor  describing the empty concept will signi\002cantly improve memory requirements by making the All description redundant All is a very large concept description and since it occurs quite frequently a large amount of memory is quickly 002lled with various instances of All  Another rather technical improvement would be to avoid computing large intermediate results This is mostly due to computing large description graphs which then turn out to be highly redundant It would be more desirable to directly compute a smaller part of this description graph which is suf\002cient for our purposes Improvements in this direction would not only decrease the memory requirements for the implementation but also the overall runtime because extra computation for reducing description graphs could be avoided As a rather drastic measure one could impose an upper bound on the role depth of the EL descriptions This would both remove the need for cyclic concept descriptions and eliminate concept descriptions that consume large amounts of memory Our experiments provide anecdotal evidence that GCIs with larger role depths are usually among the least interesting C Quality Assessment The

frequent, and there is no equal-support pruning in its subsets. So the Bitwise And Operation on binary strings of 0001100011 and 0001100011 is employed. As the result is 0001100011, the support of the itemset {G C, E} is 4, which is equal to {G, C}. E is put into the equal-support set of {G, C}, and does not need to add a new son node. When itemset {C, A, E} is checked, all of its subsets are frequent, and none of them is in the equal-support set. The corresponding two bit strings 0001101111 and 0011101011, are operated by &. The resultant string is 0001101011. The number of 1 in string 0001101011 is 5. So the support of itemset {C, A E} is 5, which is not equal to the support of {C, A}. So a new son node is added to {C, A}. The Trie after generation\(3  5 8 8 G C A E A 4 C 4 E 6 A 6 E 6 E 7 5 E 0001101011 E  Fig. 2.

In the last step, all frequent itemsets are written out according to the Trie  5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  


The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
