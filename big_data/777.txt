Surviving Attacks and Intrusions What can we Learn from Fault Models Axel Krings Zhanshan Sam Ma University of Idaho University of Idaho Moscow ID USA Moscow ID USA krings@uidaho.edu ma@vandals.uidaho.edu Abstract When designing or analyzing applications or infrastructures with high reliability safety security or survivability demands the fundamental questions are what is required of the application and can the infrastructure support these 
requirements In the design and analysis of fault-tolerant systems fault models have served us well to describe the theoretical limits But with the inclusion of malicious acts the direct application of fault models has exposed limited applicability However we can take advantage of the powerful fault models if we defer their direct application from the events that lead to faults that is the fault causes and instead focus on the effects This way one can avoid questions referring to the meaning of fault models in the context of previously unsuitable faults like Trojan horses or Denial 
of Service DoS attacks Instead we can use fault models at the level of abstraction where the application maps on the infrastructure In this paper fault models are discussed in the context of system survivability and malicious act It is shown that these models can be used to balance the demands put on the application and the capabilities of the underlying infrastructure Active and imposed fault descriptions are deìned that allow to match the mechanisms that provide sur 
vivability to the application with the infrastructure-imposed limitations By deìning a system as a collection of functionalities individual functionalities and their associated fault descriptions can be analyzed in isolation 1 Introduction In the design of systems that are subjected to security and survivability threats one cannot directly apply many of the models and approaches used in fault tolerant systems design The main reason is that for these models and approaches that have proven so successful in the design of dependable systems the fault causes and their distributions do 
not translate For example it is straightforward to derive the fail rates of a component as the result of mechanical stress of breakdown over time However it is very difìcult if not impossible to determine fail rates when a system is subjected to malicious act resulting in uncertain unobserved or unobservable events This means that designing secure and survivable systems is much harder than designing fault-tolerant systems a fact that has been acknowledged by the security and dependability community at large 
Fault-tolerant systems are at the core of modern societies and these systems were largely designed for fault-tolerance and not with malicious act in mind Thus given the everincreasing dependence of society on computerized systems e.g control of our critical infrastructures or environmental monitoring understanding the dependability security and survivability of systems is imperative Dependability is a general term that typically encompasses many deìnitions related to fault tolerance such as reliability safety availability performability and maintainability These terms have formal deìnitions and their quantiìcation can be re 
viewed in any general text on fault tolerance Quantifying security or survivability on the other hand is a different story For example to date there is not even a single agreed-upon deìnition for system survivability Many qualitative and quantitative deìnitions have been suggested as reviewed in 8 Ho we v e r  there ha v e only been modest advances related to analyzing systems subjected to malicious acts or unpredictable events At the core of the problem is the function representing the fail rate often also 
called hazard function This function ranges from a simple constant to complex functions of variables and covariates with vast differences in the complexity of computability 2 Background Since the research discussed here addresses different aspects of security survivability and fault-tolerance some Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


background is necessary to understand the main issues Some of the preliminary information is drawn from 2.1 Design for Testability and Survivability Why is it so difìcult to design systems that are faulttolerant secure and survivable Letês consider the evolution of integrated circuits and an approach that was called Design for Testability  As integrated circuits became larger exhaustive testing became infeasible i.e the set of test vectors needed to test circuits became intractable This was formalized in the test vector generation problem and it was realized that one had to design circuits for testability rather than relying on testing circuits that were not designed with testability in mind Systems with high security and survivability demands suffer from the same phenomena As systems are becoming increasingly complex and difìcult to analyze the notion of designing for survivability i.e integrating the mechanisms that aid survivability into the system rather than as an addon feature became a natural extension analogous to design for testability If one could fully test and v erify a system then this would not be an issue However if completely testing integrated circuits is already NP hard then there is no hope for complex systems For example whereas integrated circuits have as complex building blocks ip-îops software has many complex mechanisms for branching the simplest being a branch based on the state of a single variable Thus for complex software and hardware systems design for survivability is not a choice but should be a requirement It should be noted that the concept of design for survivability using diverse terminology has been suggested by many researchers over the years As the need for veriìcation and certiìcation of systems has been increasing the concept of design for survivability should be extended to require design for analyzability asit is analysis that allows for the determination and quantiìcation of the health of a system 2.2 Fault Models Faults have been classiìed by their behavior Many different taxonomies exist and typical terms include crash fault benign fault value fault or malicious fault The faults may be transient intermittent or permanent The diversity of faults and their consequences on a system have been the primary motivator for the deìnition of fault models Fault models have played a major role in reliability analysis as well as agreement and consensus algorithms A fault model addresses the behavior of the faults and the redundancy levels required to tolerate a single fault type or perhaps a mix of fault types Many different fault models have been proposed over the years For example consider b benign faults in a set of N components As long as a functionality f i requires only one component to function properly then f i can function as long as one component survives i.e f i needs at least N  b 1 components The assumptions on a benign fault are very restrictive as benign faults imply that they are globally diagnosable and do not affect any other components The fault model described in made no assumptions about the fault behavior and it was shown that to tolerate m malicious faults f i needed at least N 3 m 1 components In the design of dependable systems this fault model however seemed overly conservative since it assumed that every fault is malicious In order to introduce more exibility and to combine different fault types into one fault model so-called hybrid fault models were derived Hybrid fault models consider multiple fault behavior and cardinality The mix of faults may range from benign symmetric to asymmetric faults and include potential transmissive and omissive behaviors The basic idea behind these models was to 1 specify the expected fault types and their count and 2 to derive the algorithms and redundancy management system to tolerate the fault mix For example using the model of one may ha v e a s ystem speciìcation that needs to tolerate a speciìc mix of faults e.g 3 benign faults 1 symmetric fault and 1 asymmetric fault Symmetric faults are value faults where a wrong value is equally perceived by all other modules Asymmetric faults make no restrictions on the values received by other nodes The causes of the faults considered in the dependability community have been attributed mainly to failing components e.g due to material fatigue breakdown of physical or electronic components accidents or environmental inîuences The impact of malicious behavior e.g as the result of hacking may it be from external sources or even insiders viruses or Trojan horses denial of service etc have traditionally not been addressed It was only later that accidental and intentional faults were discussed side by side 1 Thus when considering survi v ability  one may 1 take the approach of using the standard notions from fault tolerance and extending the deìnition of a fault to include those attributable to malicious act or 2 focus on the effect of a fault rather than the fault cause For some faults this may create philosophical arguments e.g should a trojan horse that has not been triggered be ignored since no fault has been introduced yet In this research faults are always viewed in the context of what they are capable of producing regardless of time It is of extreme importance to know what faults a system should be able to tolerate and to know exactly what this requires of the system since technologies may be inherently capable or incapable of tolerating certain faults Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


3 Survivable System Deìnition In the deìnition of a survivable system using the notion of fault models the reader should not make the mistake of viewing this deìnition as an attempt to simply argue that a survivable system can be expressed as a traditional fault-tolerant system As indicated above this view does not work due to the fact that survivable systems are expected to deal with unpredictable unobserved or unobservable events In fact the hazard function for survivable systems is much more complex Our view of the systems is based on its survivability capabilities with respect to fault models Speciìcally every system functionality f i can be mapped to a fault description F i  which deìnes the fault model with respect to the speciìc functionality Thus F i indicates the fault types that f i is designed to tolerate However F i says nothing about how many faults of a speciìc type can or should be tolerated For example consider a communication service f i that supports authentication First letês consider the case in which we assume that authentication is unbreakable or otherwise resilient to compromise For this case the resulting fault description is F i  b   The fault description indicates that attacks against authentication always result in benign faults as indicated by parameter b  and since authentication is viewed as non-compromisable all faulty values can be expelled In this particular case there is thus no bound on the number of benign faults that can be tolerated Note that this interpretation of a benign fault is very different from that usually used in dependability where benign faults are typically associated with a component that fails in a benign manner and as long as there is one functioning component all is ne However as indicated before in this research we look at the effects of the fault not what caused it This presents the departure from the deìnition of a fault in the dependability community where a fault is a physical aw that may produce an error that in turn may cause failure Under that view a denied authentication is not seen as a fault it is simply a feature of the authentication mechanism A non-value-based example of a benign fault is the case where the authentication system crashes in a benign fashion Next consider a second case where authentication has been compromised e.g due to a security breach Now the previous model for F i does not hold anymore i.e F i  b  is unsuitable Therefore we need a model capable of addressing the faults possibly resulting from an attack against a compromisable authentication system Under the fault model described in multiple f ault types are considered i.e benign symmetric and asymmetric faults The resulting fault description for our compromisable authentication example is F i  b s a   where b  s  and a indicate the potential of benign symmetric and asymmetric faultbehavior respectively Failed authentication attempts result in 1 benign faults if the attack is recognized 2 symmetric value faults if the same faulty value is sent to all redundant authentication modules and 3 and asymmetric value faults if different faulty values are send to different redundant authentication modules Note that the only failed authentication attempts that are recognized are those resulting in benign faults Furthermore note that both symmetric and asymmetric faults are value faults However as indicated before the difference is that in the rst case the faulty value is consistently perceived by all redundant modules Value faults are not detected or corrected unless the correct redundancy management mechanisms are in place In the case of symmetric faults it has been shown that a redundancy level of N  2 s 1 can tolerate the s value faults and in the case of asymmetric faults Byzantine majority may be necessary i.e N  3 a 1  In both of the two cases discussed above authentication is assumed but the assumptions on the effectiveness of this functionality have changed It should be obvious that wrong assumptions and thus infeasible fault descriptions F i  will affect the survivability of the system For example the system with F  b  that relies entirely on its authentication mechanism will not be able to tolerate a value fault should authentication be compromised It is thus important that system designers carefully evaluate the risk to system survivability and the consequences of making false assumptions In order to manage the complexity of a system S we view the system as a collection of k functionalities i.e S  k  i 1 f i  where each f i has an associated fault description F i  System survivability is a function of all F i  Note that S is not a scalar resulting from the sum of values it is a collection of functionalities similar to 5 The vie w o f the system as a collection of functionalities allows for the evaluation and analysis of each functionality in isolation or in groups of functionalities It should be noted that this isolation-based view is very similar to the determination of essential services and their associated essential components which were determined in by tracing scenarios through the system architecture Whereas in their case this was extracted or traced from the system in our case this is the actual deìnition of the system Just as functionalities are not necessarily independent e.g functionality f i may utilize functionality f j  neither are their respective fault descriptions F i and F j  Thus any wrong assumptions about a fault description may propagate through many functionalities Speciìcally if f i  f p  f q  i.e if f i is composed of f p and f q  then the resulting F i depends on the fault types of its components i.e F i  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


g  F p F q   The composition simply indicates that f i has components that assume F p and others that consider F q  However it is important to see that the weaker fault description may be dominant Thus at this point there are no assumptions made about the composition function g  Typical compositions include series parallel or series-parallel constructs Furthermore no assumptions are made about the signiìcance or importance of different fault descriptions If there is a need to analyze the signiìcance then weights or weight functions can be associated with F i Herehowever the focus is simply on realizing that a system deìnition based on functionalities allows us to take advantage in the choice of mechanisms and their theoretical susceptibility to diverse faults as will be described later Fault description F i needs to be analyzed for its potential impacts on the survivability requirements Thus the question about the impact of changes in fault assumptions impact of security features availability and their failure boils down to the analysis of the functionalities in the context of the fault descriptions F i  Conversely given survivability requirements one can determine feasibility under infrastructureor application-induced limitations In this case F i needs to be mapped onto the infrastructure i.e it needs to be determined if the infrastructure is inherently suitable to support the fault model described by F i  4 System Analysis System analysis of complex systems has its roots in dependability analysis or more speciìcally reliability analysis In the dependability community the reliability R  t  is the probability that the system works as speciìed without failure during the entire time period from 0 t   Thus system analysis boils down to the quantiìcation of reliability under consideration of the fault model and the assumptions about the fault environment Similarly survivability analysis is an attempt to quantifying system survivability under the same considerations The fault model has been deìned above as the partitioning of the fault space The fault environment however is much more complex as it addresses the statistical assumption about the faults themselves e.g the fail rates or hazard function and the independence or interdependence of faults Perhaps the simplest analysis model is the traditional reliability model based on constant fail rates which is speciìed as R  t  e  t  where R  t  is the probability that the lifetime T of the system exceeds time t and  is the fail rate This model is used extensively in reliability block diagrams fault tree analysis Markov chain models and Petri net analysis However the assumption of a constant fail rate exponential failure distribution is very limited It is mostly suitable for many problems in the dependability community where no malicious act is assumed and faults are considered to be independent Therefore R  t  e  t should only be used for the determination of the reliability of those components that are feasibly modeled by a constant fail rate e.g hardware reliability The reliability model R  t  e  t is not generally suitable to analyze systems subjected to malicious act due to its limitations i.e the aforementioned constant fail rates independence-of-failures assumption and the inability of effective censoring Some research has therefore attempted to eliminate the fail rates altogether For example in a survivability analysis was presented that was based on the deìnition of survivability of the T1A1.2 group A survivability analysis was shown that was not dependent on the fail rate induced by malicious act Speciìcally a steady state solution was used up to but not including some time t f  the time at which the fault ocurred Then a transient solution showed the dynamic recovery of the system However the time of the event that lead to the fault was not important and the steady state solution simply served as the starting probabilities of the second part which was initiated by the malicious act at time t f  The approach presented in  is v ery dependent on the application which in this case was a telephone system Furthermore the Markov model of the system was very regular The alternative of eliminating the fail rates is dealing with them However the mathematical models associated with non-constant hazard functions quickly become very complex as will be addressed in Section 4.1 No matter what models are used for the analysis itself at the basis of any model is the fault description i.e the fault model considered This will hopefully lead to an analysis approach based on functionalities f i and the associated F i  with potentially different assumptions about the hazard functions themselves as they apply to the functionalities and their underlying infrastructure This decomposition of the overall combined model is thus an attempt to Design for Analyzability  with the goal of using the lowest feasible complexity model for each functionality f i  The choices in the design speciìcations of functionalities have direct implications on other system parameters For example increasing reliability of a functionality may in turn reduce security or performance Thus given an analysis model one can determine the tradeoff space the system is operating in The tradeoff space of a system describes the dependencies between different variables For example in the context of survivable storage in the PASIS project at CMU the tradeof f space of security  a v ailability and performance was investigated with respect to data storage across distributed storage units Survivability was addressed by spreading information among independent storage nodes As the number of storage shares increased so did performance data bandwidth However system availability and security were negatively affected Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


4.1 Dealing with Complex Hazard Functions As indicated before one of the main problems dealing with malicious acts such as intrusions or other attacks are the different degrees of unpredictability In this was captured with the introduction of so-called UUUR events Unpredictable latent Unobserved and Unobservable Risks In order to assess the consequences of UUUR events survival analysis with its sister elds competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis were introduced in and 16 respecti v ely  A three-layer survi vability analysis architecture was introduced that consisted of tactical strategic and operational levels This architecture allows to integrate reliability hybrid fault models and survivability under a uniìed paradigm A comprehensive introduction of three-layer survivability analysis is beyond the scope of this paper Here we only brieîy discuss one aspect of the tactical level dealing with complex hazard functions We completely skip the strategic and operational level modeling which can be found in and In the absence of UUUR events the tactical level is largely equivalent to traditional reliability analysis Indeed the most fundamental deìnition in survival analysis is the survivor function S  t  Pr  T>t   which has the exact same deìnition as the reliability function The hazard function h  t  and the cumulative hazard functions H  t  even use the same terminology besides the common mathematical deìnitions However there are additional advantages from introducing survival analysis over the traditional reliability analysis Major advantages of survival analysis are i more exible time-variant and covariates-dependent hazard functions ii built-in procedures to deal with censored events iii multivariate failure beyond binary failure and iv more effective modeling of dependent failure events through competing risks and shared frailty modeling Details can be found in 13 14 15 Our interest is with regard to the hazard functions listed in the advantages of i Therefore we now brieîy introduce several forms of hazard functions from survival analysis to show one of the advantages of adopting survival analysis The simplest type of hazard function is the constant hazard function which is when the failure time follows exponential distribution It takes the form h  t   1 With the original Cox Proportional Hazards Model PHM the hazard function becomes time and covariates dependent   t z   0  t  e Z 2 where Z is the vector of covariates such as environment factors that inîuence the hazard function and  o  t  is the baseline hazard function The Cox PHM has been extended numerously e.g 18  T w o simple e xtensions the stratiìed Cox PHM and the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates are of particular interest and their applicability will be discussed below First we introduce the stratiìed Cox PHM Suppose there is a factor that occurs on q levels and for which the socalled proportionality assumption of PHM may be violated The hazard function for an individual in the j th stratum or level of this factor is  j  t z   0 j  t  e Z 3 for j 1  2   q  The baseline hazard function  01       0 q    for the q strata are permitted to be arbitrary and are completely unrelated The second generalization to the PHM is the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates Here the covariates Z depend on time t  i.e Z  Z  t   For unstratiìed PHM the hazard function is   t  z  t    0  t  e Z  t   4 and for stratiìed PHM it is  j  t  z  t    0 j  t  e Z  t   j 1  2   q 5 With the increase of the hazard function complexity from Equation 1 to 5 their descriptive power and exibility also increase For example the stratiìed PHM Equations 3 and 5 may be used to formulate a uniìed hazard function for various levels of security alerts e.g low medium and high The choice of the hazard function that can be used has signiìcant implications on the complexity of the system analysis 4.2 Model Changes and State Changes The view of the functionality-based analysis model described above has several advantages in theory 1 Different functionalities can have different fault descriptions 2 Different functionalities can utilize different hazard functions 3 Each functionality may change its fault description and/or hazard function in time The rst advantage is the exibility to view the fault description of each functionality in isolation This design for analyzability feature allows for ease of analysis The second advantage is signiìcant since the type of hazard function has huge implications on the complexity of the analysis Note that the term complexity is not to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


interpreted as computational complexity but as the complexity of the approach Having the exibility of selecting an appropriate hazard function for individual functionalities rather than for the entire complex system allows to study the effects of speciìc assumptions about failing rates This way one can move in the trade-off space of simplicity of analysis versus accuracy of the hazard function For example the simple hazard function of Equation 1 is suitable for the analysis of certain functionalities but it is not generally suitable for malicious act From an analysis point of view it is desirable to select the least complicated hazard function suitable for each functionality Thus just because certain aspects of the systems may be subjected to UUUR events the entire system does not have to use the complicated hazard model The third advantage is the exibility to consider the analysis in different phases with potentially different hazard functions at different stages This can be modeled using a state machine Consider the three different threat levels e.g low medium and high one may use the stratiìed Cox PHM model expressed with Equations 3 and 5 Such system may adapt to threat levels announced by some authority The system hazard function may transition from one stratum to another when the threat levels change For example the sequence h i   h k   h j   h i would represent a system that transitions through various states strata each with their respective hazard functions The sequence could be from the state machine shown in Figure 1  h i h k h j Figure 1 Thread Model State Machine 5 Fault Model Adaptation As information becomes available that may change the systemês landscape changes to the system model or parameters need to be considered Such adaptation is considered to be an integrated feature in any design for survivability For example in 6 survi v ability w a s described in terms of Resistance Recognition Recover and Adaptation Adaptation implemented the mechanism to adapt the system to knowledge gained in the prior three phases Our interest is primarily in adaptation related to the fault model Adaptation may be the result of diverse scenarios such as 1 The fault description F i is no longer valid due to a speciìc event For example intelligence suggests that authentication may be compromised As a result fault types that are not reîected in F i may occur 2 The fault description of f i should be strengthened by design This may be the result of analysis indicating that a functionality may be the weakest link 3 The infrastructure that f i relied on has changed The implications of this change on the fault description need to be evaluated Of special interest is the case where the infrastructure may not be able to support tolerance of certain fault types In general adaptation is viewed to address the dynamics of changes in fault descriptions F i  which however has to be addressed in the context of the capabilities of the system or infrastructure that supports functionality f i  Thus we want to be able to point out if there is a mismatch between 1 what is assumed or implemented by f i and 2 inherently theoretically possible in the system We deìne the active fault description as the fault model that the system currently subscribes to i.e the faults that f i assumes to be able to tolerate or deal with Thus for functionality f i the fault description F i is the active fault description The speciìcation of F i is determined by the system designer or more speciìcally by the designer of f i  The real question that remains is whether the systemês infrastructure can support this F i  In contrast to the active fault description the imposed fault description denoted by  F i  is the fault model that the infrastructure of the system or application imposes on f i  It encompasses those fault types that the system has to explicitly deal with by distinct mechanisms For example  F i  b s  indicates that for the given infrastructure benign and symmetric faults are possible and theoretically unavoidable However note that  F i does not list asymmetric faults The reason is that the infrastructure is assumed to be capable of theoretically eliminating this fault type An infrastructure that has an imposed fault description  F i  b s  is a broadcast network In such a network asymmetric faults are not possible due to the fact that every module in the broadcast domain can see every message The active and imposed fault descriptions can serve the system designers to analyze the survivability of f i  Letês consider the authentication example in a general network environment under the fault model of and assume that messages are signed First we assume that point-to-point communication e.g TCP/IP is used Furthermore consider the two cases where 1 TCP/IP provides reliable transmission and 2 when TCP may time out With respect to the infrastructure in case 1 this leads to an imposed fault description of  F i  s a   meaning that there are no benign Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


faults However value faults both symmetric and asymmetric cannot be resolved without explicit mechanisms If we consider case 2 in which TCP may time out then  F i  b s a   Next letês consider the active fault descriptions If our authentication scheme is assumed to be uncompromisable then F i  b   otherwise it is F i  b s a   The interesting case in the example above is when authentication is compromised Value faults cannot be dealt with unless the authentication mechanism is implemented to provide redundancy levels of N  2 s 1 and N  3 a 1 for symmetric and asymmetric behavior respectively Note that in order to avoid common mode faults the redundant modules should be dissimilar In order to deal with symmetric faults one needs a simple majority of unaffected modules However asymmetric faults do not only require a higher degree of redundancy but also require that agreement algorithms be used These algorithms typically work in rounds of message exchanges The result is high message overhead in addition to the high component count However since in our example the imposed and active fault descriptions both contain s and a  there is no easy way around having to deal with these faults explicitly For the system designer the choices seem clear 1 one lives with the risk of authentication compromises or 2 one pays the cost of module and message overhead But how high is that cost This depends on how many faults of type s and a one wants to tolerate In addition common mode faults need to be addresses and thus the cost of dissimilar components needs to be considered Design Changes The advantage of working with imposed fault description is that it gives insight about what the infrastructure cannot inherently deal with This allows for adaptation that can bring signiìcant simpliìcations to the application Consider the example above and assume that authentication may be compromised i.e assume that F i   F i  b s a   The largest challenge is to avoid having to deal with costly asymmetric faults However the infrastructure cannot tolerate such faults implicitly and thus explicit mechanisms such as agreement algorithms must be used Therefore letês consider what changes can be made to the infrastructure in order to avoid asymmetric faults With respect to networking this is actually quite simple As indicated before a broadcast environment cannot exhibit asymmetric behavior Therefore assume that point-to-point networking in authentication is eliminated and that broadcasting is used instead Under the broadcast paradigm every node can see the same messages so that Byzantine faults can be immediately detected Now  F i  b s   and thus the application can provide simple mechanisms to take advantage of the imposed tolerance to asymmetric faults Thus by observing the limitations of the imposed fault description an infrastructure-related change can make large improvements Adaptive Policies In the previous example the design of the authentication mechanism was motivated by low cost which resulted in an active model considering only benign faults If value faults are suspected then the high cost of dealing with value faults most signiìcantly asymmetric faults was required However in most applications the worse case behavior e.g broken authentication may be only of importance during times of high threat levels This suggest a security policy that is exible and sensitive to the threat level Such a policy would select the lowest overhead solution possible under a given threat level In our authentication example this could mean using the benign model under normal situations and augmenting value faults if the threat level is high Such gear shifting is not new and has been used in the context of agreement algorithms to reduce overhead Infrastructure Changes Lastly if the infrastructure used by functionalities f i changes then one should consider if these changes have implications on the imposed fault description If they do then perhaps one can take advantage of this change On the other hand it may mean that now the limitations of the infrastructure need to be compensated by more sophisticated solutions An example of such degeneration is when a network changes from a broadcast to a point-to-point communication primitive In all the cases above the careful analysis of F i and  F i should be undertaken Misjudging the fault model can render the application non-survivable 6 Conclusions A new view of fault models was presented that shifted away from the fault cause and instead focused on the effect of faults This allows for the use of fault models in the analysis of systems operating in hostile environments A general view of design for survivability was adopted This implied that the application and infrastructure were viewed in concert in order to determine which fault models they required and supplied By viewing a system as a collection of functionalities each functionality could be separately analyzed This simpliìed the determination of the active and imposed fault description which was then used to determine a mapping between what the application functionality required and what the infrastructure could or could not support In the latter case explicit solutions must be used to overcome the infrastructure induced limitations With respect to system analysis the functionality-based view of the system allowed exibility in the choice of hazard functions Rather than using one model for the entire system now each functionality can be analyzed using its appropriate hazard functions

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
