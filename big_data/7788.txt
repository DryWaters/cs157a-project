1 Introduction Pattern discovery is a central task in data mining 19 Finding frequently occurring patterns from data has been one of the most actively studied problems in the 036eld and many kinds of frequent patterns can be found ef\036ciently see e.g 1 16 26 29 Ho we v e r  the fundamental problem in pattern discovery is how to bene\036t from the found patterns In this paper we study the global structure of the pattern collection from the local point of view of patterns This is pursued by a ew representation for pattern collections change ro\336les  A change pro\036le of a pattern describes what are the ratios between the frequency of the pattern and the frequencies of its suband superpatterns in the pattern collection i.e the patterns comparable with it w.r.t a iven partial order relation To simplify the considerations we divide the change pro\036le 
ch p of a pattern p into two parts adapting the terminology of 28 the specializing change pro\036le ch p s describes the changes to the superpatterns of p  and the generalizing change pro\036le ch p g describes the changes to the subpatterns of p  As a concrete example let us consider the set collection  A B C AB BC AC ABC  with frequencies fr  A  3  4  fr  B   2  
fr  C   4  fr  AB   4  fr  AC   2  fr  BC   2 and fr  ABC   4  r these frequencies the specializing change pro\036les of the singleton sets A  B and C are mappings ch A s   B 002 fr  AB  fr

 3   The change pro\036les attempt to reach from the local description of the data a collection of patterns to more global view of the relationships between the patterns As an application to more classical pattern analysis the change pro\036les can be used to de\036ne dis measures between the patterns Also the patterns can be scored with help of their change pro\036les In addition of being a potentially useful tool in data analysis the change pro\036les can be used to construct condensed representations of pattern collections 5 6 7 8 9 25 30 32 34 Man y kno wn condensed representations can be adapted to the change pro\036les t the change pro\036les suggest also some l approaches to frequency estimation In this paper we introduce the concept of a change pro\036le a new representation for pattern collections that attempts to bridge the gap between local and global descrip 
tion of data We describe several riations of change pro\036les and examine their properties As the change pro\036les have more complex structure than the frequencies f the frequent patterns they can be used to de\036ne dissimilarity measures between the frequent patterns We consider different approaches to cluster the change pro\036les and show that many f the clustering problems are NP hard and inapproximable for a wide variety of natural dissimilarity measures for change pro\036les As an application to the condensed representations we propose methods for approximating frequencies of the frequent patterns from their approximate change pro\036les and evaluate the methods empirically Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


The rest of the paper is organized as follows The concept of the change pro\036le and its re\036nements are introduced in Section 2 The clustering of change pro\036les is studied in Section 3 In Section 4 a few approaches to estimate frequencies of a pattern collection from approximate change pro\036les are described In Section 5 the frequency estimation methods are evaluated empirically Section 6 consists of a short conclusion In the remaining sections we describe everything using frequent sets t the discussion generalizes readily o arbitrary pattern collections with a partial order 2 Association Rules and Change Pro\336les The frequent set mining problem is given a sequence d  d 1 d n of subsets of a 036nite set R and a threshold value 001 003 0  1  036nd all subsets X of R such that the frequency of X  fr  X d   i  X 004 d i  1 005 i 005 n   n  is at least 001  These sets are called 001 frequent sets in d and they are denoted by F  001 d   The frequency f X can be interpreted as the empirical probability P  X  of the event 223the event contains X as its subset\224 A classical set R is the collection of items sold in a supermarket Then the most popular sequence d of subsets of R is sequence of market baskets of the customers In addition to the market baskets of the customers there are several other interesting sequences of subsets of the items for the logistics division of a company an interesting sequence d could rather be the sequence of packages arriving from the logistics center The frequent set mining is computationally feasible as there are several methods for mining frequent sets output ef\036ciently 1 3 17 18 21 22 Although each frequent set contains useful information about the data set also the relationships between different frequent sets might be valuable These relationships has been exploited by association rules An association rule X 006 Y is a rule that associates a set X 004 R to a set Y 004 R  n association rule X 006 Y is called simple if Y is a singleton The accuracy of the association rule X 006 Y is acc  X 006 Y d  fr  X 007 Y d  fr  X d   The frequency of the rule X 006 Y is de\036ned to be fr  X 006 Y d  fr  X 007 Y d   The accuracy of the association rule X 006 Y can be interpreted as a conditional probability P  Y  X   Thus each association rule X 006 Y describes one relationship of the set X  Empirical conditional probabilities with different kinds of events has been studied in data mining under the name of cubegrades 23 A more global view to relationships between the frequent set X and other frequent sets can be obtained by combining the association rules X 006 Y into a mapping from the frequent sets to the interval 0  1  We call this mapping a specializing change pro\336le  De\336nition 1 Specializing change pro\336le A specializing change pro\336le of a frequent set X is a mapping ch X s   Y  X 007 Y 003F  001 d  002 0  1 consisting of the accuracies of frequent rules X 006 Y  i.e ch X s  Y  fr  X 007 Y d  fr  X d  where X 007 Y 003F  001 d   A specializing change pro\036le ch X s can be interpreted as a conditional probability distribution P  Y  X  where Y is a random variable Similarly to the specializing change pro\036les we can de\036ne a generalizing change pro\336le  De\336nition 2 Generalizing change pro\336le A specializing change pro\336le of a frequent set X is a mapping ch X g  F  001 d  002 1  1 001  consisting of the inverse accuracies of the frequent rules acc  X  Y 006 X   i.e ch X g  Y  fr  X  Y d  fr  X d   We denote change pro\036les by ch X when we do not want to 036x the type of the change pro\036le ch X  Y  is called a change of X on Y  The generalizing change pro\036le of X corresponds to 1  P  X  X  Y   Each specializing and generalizing change pro\036le ch X s and ch X g describe 223upper\224 and 223lower\224 neighborhoods N s  X  and N g  X  of the frequent set X in the collection of frequent sets respectively The neighborhood N  X  N s  X  007 N g  X  of X consists of the frequent sets Y 003 N s  X  that contain X and the frequent sets Y 003 N g  X  that are contained in X  i.e the frequent sets that are comparable with X  The change pro\036les as we have de\036ned them are highly redundant due to the following simple properties of sets 200 X 007 Y  X 007  Y  X  and 200 X  Y  X   Y b X   By ploiting these properties we can reduce without loss of information the number of de\036ned values of the change pro\036le by factor 2  X  in the case of a specializing change pro\036le ch X s  and by factor 2  R  X  in the case of a generalizing change pro\036le ch X g  We call this kind of change pro\036les with reduced redundancy the concise change pro\336les  Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


De\336nition 3 Concise specializing change pro\336le A concise specializing change ro\336le cch X s is a restriction of ch X s to elements Y such that Y b X  t and X 007 Y 003F  001 d   De\336nition 4 Concise generalizing change pro\336le A concise generalizing change ro\336le cch X g is a restriction of ch X g to elements Y such that Y 004 X  The concise change pro\036les can be interpreted as af\036ne axis-parallel subspaces of R F  001,d   that are d y Y s.t Y b X  t X 007 Y 003F  001 d  in the specializing case and Y s.t Y 004 X in the generalizing case The concise change pro\036les for F  001 d  can be computed outputoptimally by a careful implementation of the following algorithm C HANGE P ROFILES  F  001 d  fr  1 for each X in F  001 d  2 do for each Y Y 004 X 3 do cch X  Y s  Y  n fr  X  fr  X  Y  4 cch X g  Y  n fr  X  Y  fr  X  5 return 001 cch s  cch g 002 The neighborhoods of even the concise change pro\036les can be too large r example if X 003F  001 d   then  cch 001 s 013 2  X  and  cch X g 013 2  X   Thus following the de\036nitions of association rules we de\036ne simple specializing change ro\336les and simple generalizing change ro\336les  De\336nition 5 Simple change pro\336le A simple specializing generalizing change pro\336le sch X s  sch X g  is a restriction of ch X s of ch X s  to singletons Y  The number of bits needed for a simple change pro\036le is at most  R  log  d   Each change pro\036le can e expressed as a vector of length  R  and each value of the change pro\036le can be describe using at most log  d  bits Especially for the generalizing change pro\036les this upper bound can be quite loose when R is large as the number f sets in F  001 d  is 001 001 2  X  002 where X is the largest set in F  001 d   3 Clustering the Change Pro\336les In order to be able to 036nd groups of similar change pro\036les it would e useful to be able to somehow measure the similarity or dissimilarity between the change pro\036les The dissimilarity between change pro\036les ch X and ch Y can be de\036ned to be their distance in the common domain Dom 001 ch X 002 b Dom 001 ch Y 002 w.r.t some distance function We assume the dissimilarity function 002 to be such that 002 001 ch X ch Y 002 0 f\006 ch X  Z  ch Y  Z  holds for all Z 003 Dom 001 ch X 002 b Dom 001 ch Y 002  A complementary approach would be to focus on the differences in the structure of the pattern collection e.g to measure the difference between two change pro\036les by computing the symmetric difference of their domains This kind of dissimilarity function concentrates wholly on the structure of the pattern collection and thus neglects the frequencies A sophisticated dissimilarity function should probably consist both points of view We shall focus on the 036rst one We further assume that for the distance function 002 holds There are several ys to de\036ne what is a good clustering and each approach has its n strengths and weaknesses 13 A simple w a y t o group change pro\036les based on a dissimilarity function de\036ned in their pairwise common domains is to allow two change pro\036les ch X and ch Y to be in the same group only if 002 001 ch X ch Y 002 0  The task is n a collection C h of change pro\036les to 036nd a partition C h 1  C h k of C h such that for each ch X ch Y 003 C h i  1 005 i 005 k  holds 002 001 ch X ch Y 002 0  Let us call this problem the change ro\336le packing problem  Unfortunately the problem seems to be very dif\036cult Theorem 1 The change ro\336le packing roblem for specializing change ro\336les is at least as hard s the minimum graph coloring problem Proof The minimum graph coloring problem is n a graph G  V E   to 036nd a labeling l  V 002 N of vertices with the smallest number of different labels l  u  such that if u v 003 V are adjacent then l  u  r  l  v  2 Let v 1 v n be an arbitrary ordering f the vertices in V and e 1 e m an ordering of the edges in E  We 036rst construct an instance  001 d  of frequent set mining problem and then show that the specializing change pro\036les C h computed from the frequent sets F  001 d  can be partitioned into k sets C h 1  C h k if and only if the graph G is k colorable To simplify the description we shall consider w.l.o.g simple change pro\036les instead of change pro\036les The set R consists of the elements in V 007 E  For each v i there are 3 n sets d i 1 d i 3 n  Each set d i,j contains v i  We put the edge  v i v j 003 E into d i 3 j 212 1 and d i 3 j 212 1 if i<j  and otherwise into d i 3 j  We set 001 1  001 3 n 2 002 and compute the collection F  001 d  of frequent sets The collection F  001 d  consists of the empty set t  singletons  v 1    v n    e 1     e m  and pairs  v i e 016 V 327 E where v i 003 e  Thus the cardinality of F  001 d  is polynomial in the size of G  The simple change pro\036les of F  001 d  are the following sch 001 s  x  003 1 n 1 n 2 if x 003 V if x 003 E sch e s  v  if v 003 e sch v i s   v i v j   003 2  3 n  1  3 n  if i<j if i>j Clearly 002 001 sch 001  sch v 002  0  002 001 sch 001  sch e 002  0 and 002  sch v  sch e   0  Thus no two f sch v  sch e and sch 001 Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal

for any v 003 V and e 003 E can be in same group On the other hand all the sch e s can be packed into one set C h k 1 and sch 001 s will always have its own set C h k 2  Now e only have show that the simple specializing change pro\036les sch v s  e   can be partitioned into k sets C h 1  C h k if and only if the graph G is k colorable No two simple specializing change pro\036les sch v i s and sch v j s can be in the same group if  v i v j 003 E since sch v i s   v i v j   r  sch v j s   v i v j   If  v i v j   003 E then Dom  sch v i s  b Dom 001 sch v j s 002  t they can be in the same group As the minimum graph coloring problem can be mapped to the change pro\036le packing problem for specializing change pro\036les the latter is at least as hard as the minimum graph coloring problem 001 The minimum graph coloring problem is hard to approximate within  V  1 212 002 for any 003 0 unless NP  ZPP 15 Assuming that the graph is connected we get from the above mapping from graphs to change pro\036les the following rough upper bound C h  1  V  2  E 005 1  V  2 004 004 004 005  V  2 006 004 004 004  O 005  V  2 006  Therefore the change pro\036le packing problem is hard to approximate within 001 005 C h  1  2 212 002 006 for any 003 0  Although the inapproximability results seem to be devastating there are ef\036cient heuristics such as the 036rst-\036t and the best-\036t heuristics that might be able 036nd suf 036ciently good partitions ef\036ciently ever the usefulness of the heuristics should be evaluated carefully for different data sets and pattern collections The requirement that two change pro\036les ch X and ch Y can be in the same group C h i only if 002 001 ch X ch Y 002 0  might be too strict A simple approach to relax this is to discretize the frequencies of frequent sets or the changes in the change pro\036les Discretizations minimizing several different loss functions can be found ef\036ciently see e.g Instead of minimizing the number of clusters one could minimize the error for 036xed number of clusters This kind of clustering is called k clustering  it s well-studied and good approximation algorithms are known if the dissimilarity function is a metric 11 12 Unfortunately it turns out that distance function de\036ned to be the dissimilarity between change pro\036les in their common domain cannot be a metric as it cannot satisfy even the triangle inequality Theorem 2 Let d be a function that measures the distance between the change ro\336les ch X and ch Y in their common domain domain Dom 001 ch X 002 b Dom 001 ch Y 002  Then d does not satisfy the triangle inequality Proof Let ch X  ch Y and ch Z be three change pro\036les such that Dom 001 ch X 002 b Dom 001 ch Y 002  Dom 001 ch Y 002 b Dom 001 ch Z 002  t and 002 001 ch X ch Y 002  0  Thus Dom 001 ch X 002 b Dom 001 ch Z 002 r  t  Clearly these change pro\036les do not satisfy the triangle inequality since 002 001 ch X ch Z 002  0 002 001 ch X ch Y 002  002 001 ch Y ch Z 002  001 It turns out that the k clustering of specializing change pro\036le is even worse than the change pro\036le packing problem as by combining Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 e get Theorem 3 k clustering of specializing change pro\336les cannot be approximated within any ratio Proof If we could approximate k clustering of specializing change pro\036les then we could by Theorems 1 and 2 solve the minimum graph coloring problem exactly 001 A major goal in the clustering of the change pro\036les is to further understand the relationships between the frequent sets As the nature of data mining is exploratory de\036ning a maximum number for clusters or a maximum dissimilarity threshold might be dif\036cult and unnecessary These parameters can be avoided by searching for hierarchical clustering instead A hierarchical clustering of C h is a recursive partition of the elements to 2  3  C h  clusters It has the enormous bene\036t from the exploratory data analysis point of view that all the clusterings can be visualized in the same time by a tree There are two main categories of hierarchical clustering agglomerative and  The 036rst begins with C h  clusters and recursively merges them and the latter recursively partites the set C h  Both are optimal in a certain sense each agglomerative  hierarchical clustering of C h into k groups is optimal w.r.t the clustering into k 1 groups into k 212 1 groups determined the same agglomerative  hierarchical clustering Divisive strategy seems to be more suitable for clustering the change pro\036les as the dissimilarity functions we consider are de\036ned to be distances between change pro\036les in their pairwise common domains The agglomerative clustering groups 036rst change pro\036les with disjoint domains more or less arbitrary The choices of groups made in the 036rst few merges can cause huge differences in the clusterings into smaller number of clusters although the groups of change pro\036les with disjoint domains are probably quite unimportant for the whole hierarchical clustering On the other hand the divisive clustering concentrates 036rst on the nonzero distances and thus the change pro\036les with disjoint domains do not bias the whole hierarchical clustering 4 requency Estimation from Change Pro\336les The change pro\036les can be used as a basis of condensed representations and several known condensed representations can be adapted to the change pro\036les One interesting approach to condense the change pro\036les is to choose Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on

a small set of representative change pro\036les by using e.g divisive clustering replace the original change pro\036les by the chosen representatives and then estimate the frequencies from the approximate change pro\036les This can be seen as a condensed representation of the frequent sets as the approximate change pro\036les can 036t potentially into smaller space than the exact change pro\036les or even the frequent sets Also the condensed representations can be applied to further condense the approximate change pro\036les In addition to that frequencies can be estimated from the approximate change pro\036les the change pro\036les can bene\036t from the estimation the quality of the approximate change pro\036les can be assessed by evaluating how well the frequencies can be approximated from them r the rest of the section we consider only the case where no change pro\036le is missing t they are corrupted r the methods can be generalized to handle missing change pro\036les and missing change pro\036le values Thus n approximations of change pro\036les for a frequent set collection F  001 d   it is possible to estimate approximations of the frequencies of the sets in F  001 d  from the approximative change pro\036les This estimation can be done in many ways and which approach is the best depends on how the change pro\036les are approximated Here we describe an approach that is based on the estimates n y different paths from the empty set t to the set X of which frequency is being estimated Especially we concentrate on computing the average of the frequencies n by the paths from t to X  We describe the methods using simple specializing change pro\036les t the adaptation to simple generalizing change pro\036les is straightforward The number of paths equals to the number of permutations of elements in X which is  X   If F  001 d  consists of X and all of its subsets then  X  log F  001 d   and the number of paths is superpolynomial in F  001 d    This example is the worst case r the average frequency estimate r all paths can be computed much faster by observing that the average frequency of X is the average of the average frequencies of Y 004 X  Y    X 212 1  scaled by ch Y s  X  Y  222s i.e fr  X  1   X  007 Y 002 X  Y    X 212 1 fr  Y  sch Y s  X  Y   From this observation we can derive a dynamic programming solution for the problem DP-F ROM S CHS  X sch s  1 fr  t  n 1 2 for i 1 to  X  3 do for each Y 004 X  Y   i 4 do fr  Y  n 0 5 for each Z 016 Y  Z    Y 212 1 6 do fr  Y  n fr  Y  fr  Z  sch Z s  Y  Z  7 fr  Y  n fr  Y    Y  8 return fr  X  The time complexity of the algorithm is O 001  X  2  X  002  O  F  001 d   log F  001 d    where k is the number of paths sampled Even this can be too much We can further speed up the estimation by simply sampling uniformly from the paths from t to X  S AMPLER F ROM S CHS  X sch s k  1 fr  t  n 1 2 fr  X  n 0 3 for j 1 to k 4 do Y n\t 5 for i 1 to  X 212 1 6 do A n R ANDOM E LEMENT  X  Y  7 fr  Y 007 A   n fr  Y  sch Y s   A   8 Y n Y 007 A  9 fr  X  n fr  X  fr  Y  sch Y s  X  Y  10 fr  X  n fr  X  k 11 return fr  X  The time complexity of the algorithm is O  k  X    The algorithm can be easily modi\036ed to an any-time algorithm This is very useful for interactive data mining and for resource bounded computation in general We can apply the same algorithms to other kinds of estimates too Especially if e ave upper and lower bounds for sch Y s  Z  for all Y 016 X Z 003 X  Y  then we can compute upper and lower bounds for fr  X   the frequency f fr  X  is at most at least the maximum of the minimum estimates the minimum of the maximum estimates n by the paths from t to X  5 Empirical Evaluation of the Frequency Estimation In this section we experimentally evaluate the stability of the noisi\036ed simple specializing change pro\036les in frequency approximation More speci\036cally we want to 036nd out how the frequency estimation from change pro\036les tolerates different kinds of noise and how the number of sampled paths affects the quality of approximation compared to the dynamic programming solution of the problem Our primary data were two data sets from UCI KDD Repository 1 Internet Usage data set consisting of 10104 rows and 10674 attributes and IPUMS Census data set consisting of 88443 rows and 39954 attributes The noisi\036ed simple change pro\036les were constructed as follows We computed the frequent sets with different minimum frequency thresholds from the above mentioned data sets using Christian Borgelt\222s implementation of the Apriori algorithm From the frequent sets we computed the 1 http://kdd.ics.uci.edu Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


simple change pro\036les In order to study how estimation methods tolerate different kinds of noise the change pro\036les were noisi\036ed in three different ways 200 randomly perturbing the values of the change pro\036les by 261 003  200 adding uniform noise from the interval  212 003 003  to the values of the change pro\036les and 200 adding zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation 003 to the values of the change pro\036les We truncated the noisi\036ed changes to the interval 0  1 as by the de\036nition of specializing change pro\036le the changes in a generalizing change pro\036le must be in that interval We tested the dependency of the approximation on the number of sampled paths by evaluating the absolute difference between the correct and the estimated frequencies for the dynamic programming solution corresponding to the average r all paths and the sampling solution corresponding to the average r different number of paths We perimented with different number of paths minimum frequency thresholds 001 and noise levels 003  Also multiplicative variants of the noising schemes were tested The results were similar to the representative results shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 Clearly quite small number of paths suf\036ces to give approximations close to the dynamic programming solution 6 Conclusions In this paper we have introduced the concept of change pro\036les a ew representation for a pattern collection that attempts to reach for a more global view to data without losing the bene\036ts of the local view We have studied their basic properties and applications Approaches to cluster change pro\036les has been suggested and several change pro\036le clustering problems has been shown to be computationally hard for wide variety of natural dissimilarity measures Also we have shown how the collection of frequent sets can be approximated from a collection of their approximate change pro\036les There are several interesting open problems for further research 200 The connection between change pro\036les and local search should be explored systematically For example the change pro\036les could be interpreted through the research on combinatorial landscapes 200 The applicability of clustering methods to cluster change pro\036les should be evaluated Although the theoretical results about the change pro\036le clustering   0.003   0.0035   0.004   0.0045   0.005   0.0055   0.006   0.0065   0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100 the average absolute error the number of paths path sampling dynamic programming    0.003   0.0035   0.004   0.0045   0.005   0.0055   0.006   0.0065   0.007   0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100 the average absolute error the number of paths path sampling dynamic programming    0.0018   0.002   0.0022   0.0024   0.0026   0.0028   0.003   0.0032   0.0034   0.0036   0.0038   0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100 the average absolute error the number of paths path sampling dynamic programming  Figure 1 The error of the frequency estimation of the 0  20 frequent sets in Internet Usage data from the change pro\336les noisi\336ed by additive Gaussian zero-mean noise with standard eviation 0  01 up perturbed by 261 0  01 middle and noisi\336ed by additive uniform noise from the interval  212 0  01  0  01 down The curves are averages of 1000 random experiments Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

Figure 4 Example of a generated map. Partial view of a topographic map of 10 x 10 nodes. The map is initially organized as a square 2D grid of nodes. The viewpoint chosen for the showed map is the Advantages viewpoint. The names of the clusters illustrate the topics \(considering the chosen viewpoint\ been highlighted by the learning. After the learning, the no des related to the same topics have been grouped into coherent areas thanks to the topographic properties of the map. The number of nodes of each area can then be considered as a good indicator of the topic weight in the database. Topics or areas near one to another represent related notions. For example, the \223 extending oil live 224 area shares some of its borders with the \223 black sludge control 224 area on the map.

ANNEX: example of interactive dynamic multi-viewpoint analysis Dynamic analysis takes place main ly by using the inter-map communication mechan ism which makes it possible to bring to successful conclusion sets of topics deductions between differen t viewpoints chosen like investigation under-fields. This a nalyze is based on the generation of an initia l activity corresponding to the premises of the deduction to check. According to stages of analyze, this activity can itself be generated several manners by the analyst on one or more source map. If the activity generation is d irectly operated by analyst on a map, it corresponds then to broad a set of topics question. If the activity generation is operated indirectly by projection query on a map or by activation of documents group stored befo rehand in a collector of documents, it corresponds then to more targeted question, which can intervene in one second stage of the analyze The analyst interest is to hi ghlight the specific areas of competence of the Exxon company. On the simulation of analysis we develop on figure 7, we will consider two different viewpoints Patentees which will represent the source of the analysis and the Title viewpoint which will represent its destination The analyst starts the process of deduction by generating an initial activity on the main Exxon topic i.e. Exxon area gravity center\ of the Patentees viewpoint map. To obtain a broad set of potential deductions, he selects the Possibilistic mode of deduction 17  The activity generated by the inter-map  communication mechanism on the Title viewpoint map is focused in two different zone s of this map, corresponding to two potential results In the first active zone \(1\, the analyst makes use two different naming strateg ies to facilitate its interpretation namely a naming strategy based on the profile of the topics more generic\ and a naming strategy based on the profile of the best members \(i.e. patents\of the topics more specific\. These operations enable him to highlight that the Exxon company is specialized in a correlative way on topics: \215 marine diesel engine 216 215 surfactant system 216 and \215 basic calcium compound 216 The expert checks the correlation between these topics by consulting the patents associated to the topic 215 surfactant system 216 \(2\. The title of the patents already confirm him the problematic de tected by the application A thorough examination of th e contents of the documents will show him than the pur pose of use of surfactant containing calcium in add ition with the normal formula of oils is to protect the combustion chambers of the marine diesel engines against corrosion due to the absorption of air charged out of salt during their operation. The problem of protection of the marine engines against corrosion is sufficiently important to represent a field of investigation for an oil manufacturer like Exxon The construction of a query containing the single descriptor \215 surfactant system 216 \(3\ on the Title viewpoint will allow the analyst 1 To validate the correlation between 215 surfactant system 216 and \215 marine diesel engine 216 topics which will be interpreted by the fact that 215 surfactant system 216 is only associated with 215 marine diesel engine 216 2 To check the inverse deduction 215 surfactant system 000\306 Exxon 216 which will insure him that Exxon is the only company whose interest in the conception of \215 surfactant system 216 The result of the projection of the query on the Title viewpoint map \(4\ shows that the generated activity is peculiar to the logical topic area \215 marine diesel engine 216, which confirms th e first assumption Simultaneously with projection the documents that are relevant for the query are presented in a Collector \(5 The global activation of these documents allows analyst to initiate a new de duction.  Then, the result of this latter can be examined on the Patentees map. Like only the main Exxon topic has been activated \(6\, the second assumption of the an alyst is confirmed The second active zone \(7\ generated by the initial process of deduction will allow the analyst to observe that the second major field of activity of Exxon is the 215 biodegradable 216 oils. It will be able to also note that these oils are more specifically us ed for the lubrication of the two-stroke engines \(\215 two cycle engine 216\ that generally reject much unburned oil Probabilistic mode of deduction will allow him to check if the inverse deduction, namely, that Exxon is the only company to be worked on biodegradable oils, can be validated \(8\. This process will lead the analyst to conclude that 215 biodegradable 216 oil manufacturing is shared between Exxon and Mobil companies \(9\, which are the most important oil manufacturers A complementary use of negative activity setting on the \215 two cycle engine 216 topic \(10\ will show more precisely to the analyst that that Mobil company mainly focus on manufacturing of biodegradable oils for \215two stroke engines\216 and, in a complementary way, that Mobil company only focus on manufacturing of biodegradable oils for \215four stroke engines\216 \(11 The simulation of analysis presented here above shows clearly how the analyst can make use of the MultiSOM functionalities in order to highlight all the privileged activity fields of the Exxon company starting from a patents database related to engineering of oils Main functionality is inter-map communication.

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
