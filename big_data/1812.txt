The Opening "Black Box" between Conflict and Knowledge Sharing A Psychological Engageme nt Theory Perspective  Xi Zhang USTC-CityU Joint Research Center Suzhou, P.R.China xizhang@mail.ustc.edu.cn   Zhenjiao Chen USTC-CityU Joint Research Center Suzhou, P.R.China sharon@mail.ustc.edu.cn  Chuanjie Guo University of Science and Technology of China cjguo@ustc.edu.cn   Abstract  Previous research indicated that task conflict 
benefits knowledge sharing within organization whereas relationship conflict damages it. However little is known about the underlying psychological process by which task and relationship conflicts have distinct effects on knowledge sharing. In this study we aim to open the "black box" in the relationship between conflict and knowledge sharing. This paper presents a mediational model of knowledge sharing and tests how three psychological states psychological meaningfulness, availability, and safety\nowledge workers' engagement mediate the effects of two types of conflict on knowledge sharing. Results of a study of 144 knowledge workers showed that task conflicts have positive effects on three psychological states, while relationship 
conflicts have negative effects. Furthermore, three psychological states aff ected workers' engagement and knowledge sharing behaviors. The results supported an integrative perspective on how workers psychological processes aff ected workersê knowledge sharing behavior in different conflict contexts   1. Introduction Knowledge sharing in organizations becomes increasingly the norm. Prior empirical studies identified a number of contextual factors as the determinants of knowledge sharing, such as information technology utilization [28   identification, pro-sharing norm, interpersonal trust  d in trag rou p conf li ct [33].

conflict is viewed as a doubled-edged sword, as it may enhance or inhibit knowledge sharing within groups, organizations, or virtual teams [8, 9, 19, 32 43 Co n f lict ref e r s to  the tension between team members due to real or perceived differences  Conflict literature classifies conflicts into task conflict and relationshi  T h e f o rm er is task-oriented and functional, whereas the latter is relationship-oriented and dysfunctional, especially for non-routine tasks u c h as creati v e idea generation t rateg i c de cis i on  m a k i ng 2], an d knowledge sharing [33  O n o n e ha nd  k n o w l e d g e

It, therefore, may facilitate knowledge sharing lin e w i t h thi s arg u m e nt, Dreu 12   found that a change from low to moderate task conflict is associated with an increase in information sharing. On the other hand, relationship conflict reflects competitive and hostile interpersonal interaction, and promotes divide, diminishes trust curtails open discussion, which in turn may have a 
negative influence on knowledge sharing [33    More recently, some studies explored behavioral mediators that link conflict with outcomes. For example, Dreu and Vianen u gg es ted t h at t h ree  conflict responses, including collaborating contending, and avoiding, mediate the relationship of relationship conflict with team functioning and team effectiveness. Dreu and Beersm o reporte d  that conflict results in flight behavior, which in turn negatively affects individuals well-being. However literature review shows that little is known about the 
underlying psychological process by which task and relationship conflicts have distinct effects on knowledge sharing In contrast, the theory of psychological engageme accou n t s f o r v a riou s psy c h o logical  states people may have under diverse work contexts and these psychological states will propel employees  engagement at work. Psychological engagement refers to both people s driving their personal energies into work role behaviors and displaying themselves within their work role [2 E n g a g e m e nt is i m portan t

between them. This study suggests that to assess members knowledge sharing behaviors, the contextual factors and psychological engagement in knowledge sharing behavior must be studied jointly In sum, the objective of the present study is to demonstrate how task and relationship conflicts affect knowledge sharing through these psychological processes. According to Kahn s c h o log i cal  engagement theory, a mediational model was built to guide this study. The results should support an integrative perspective in which task and relationship conflicts, as contextual factors, should have different influences on members psychological states meaningfulness, availability, safety\nd engagement, which in turn, affect individuals  knowledge sharing The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the literature and present the research hypotheses. Section 3 presents the study s research methodology respectively. In section 4, we present the result of data analysis. Then we discuss the results, present the implications limitations and suggest future research directions in the final section  2. Literature Review and Hypotheses 2.1 Knowledge sharing Knowledge sharing \(KS\ was defined as a set of behaviors including how to help colleagues work together, facilitating exchange knowledge, enhancing individual learning capacity, and increasing individual ability to achieve go o w ledg e  sharing was examined between both individuals and organizations. Prior literature employed social exchange theory, planned behavior theory, or social capital theory to examine the motivational and contextual antecedents of knowledge sharing. This body of research identified intrinsic and extrinsic motivations were predictive of knowledge sharing  Bock et al. [5] f o u n d t h a t org an izatio n al cli m ate  influences knowledge sharing. Wasko et al. [4 reported that organizational capitals including structural capital, cognitive capital, and relational capital have relationships on knowledge sharing Moreover, Lu, Leung and Koch d th at  information technologies utilization was positively related to knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing refers to sharing work-relevant knowledge and information, whereas, little research examines whether engaged at work affects employees  willingness to sharing their work knowledge Therefore, this study tends to fill up this gap by theorizing work engagement as an important determinant for employee knowledge sharing  2.2 Psychological engagement theory Psychological engagement theory n t s for three specific psychological conditions including meaningfulness, psychological safety, and availability, which mediate the effects of various contextual determinants on individuals  psychological engagement. Two qualitative studies have been filed. Kahn tif ied dif f e ren t  contextual antecedents of these three psychological variables. Simply put, the meaningfulness which people experience at work is influenced by work characteristics. Availability is decided by workrelated resource with which people can play their work roles. Safety is linked with non-threatening interpersonal relationship in which people are willing to engage [24, 29 May  Gi ls on an d Harter s  empirical study corroborated Kahn s framework Furthermore, Brown and Leigh th is theory to explore the mediating process \(involvement and effort\ which perceived organizational environment has influences on employees  performance Based on the psychological engagement theory we proposed a mediational model of psychological factors mediating conflict and knowledge sharing The research model is illustrated in Figure 1 Hypotheses are presented in the following sections  2.3 Psychological engagement and knowledge sharing In Kahn s [24 e t hno gr a p hi c st ud y  e nga ge me n t  was categorized into self employment and self expression. The former refers to people s devotion of personal energies into role behaviors, such as effort input. The latter refers to people s displaying oneself in the work role. It is clo sely related to the concepts of personal voice, emotional expression, nondefensive communication Ka h n 24] den o ted when people are engaged in work role, they are physically involved in task and empathically connected to others. They display their thinking feeling, and creativity s h o w ed t h at  involvement is related to personal safety. Under safe conditions, people will be more likely to share their ideas. More recent studies show engagement has positive associations with organizational citizenship behavior and identity reas on able t h at i f  people show high citizenship behavior and high identity with their organizations, they are willing to share their knowledge within their organizations Sonnentag [40 a l so fo und t h a t e n ga ge me nt  i s  positively related to some discretionary proactive behaviors including personal initiative and pursuit of learning. They argued that when dedicated to their Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


work, individuals will be more likely to engage in proactive actions to further improve their work Moreover, only when people are devoted to their work and concentrate on it, they are likely to persist in the proactive behavior. We extend this linkage to knowledge sharing, as knowledge sharing is a kind of proactive behavior. And there is a major reason why psychological engagement at work will affect knowledge sharing. To share work-related knowledge it is necessary for individuals to concentrate on their work and master the knowledge and skills of their work. Furthermore, only when people are devoted to their work, they regard it worthwhile to invest the extra effort of communicating work-related knowledge. The above argument is captured in the following hypothesis H1  Members psychological enga gement positively affects their knowledge sharing  2.4 Psychological factors under the context of conflict  Based on psychological engagement theory people ask themselves three fundamental questions in each role situation: 1\ How meaningful is it for me to bring myself into this job; 2\ How safe is it to do so 3\ How available am I to do so 29   2.4.1 Psychological meaningfulness  Meaningfulness is viewed as the value of a work goal or purpose, judged in relation to people s own stan W h en  w o rk ers f eel th at t h eir w o rk i s  worthwhile, useful and valuable, they experience meaningfulness. Workers experience lack of meaningfulness, when there is little room for them to give or receive in the work as if they make no differen  Psychological engagement theory [24 p r op o s e s  that job characteristics and co-workers relations affect the degree of meaningfulness that people experience at work. May et h o w ed j o b  characteristics which allow autonomy of using personal discretion, enable people to experience meaningfulness. Brief and Nord [6 o u n d  w h e n  employees see that they possess the right to voice and to learning, they will experience meaningfulness. All in all, task characteristics involving voice, selfexpression, and learning enable workers to experience meaningfulness in their work Besides, Kahn pos ed t h at g ood interpersonal interactions with co-workers foster a sense of social identity, which further leads to a sense of meaningfulness. Subsequently, May [29 fo und  empirical evidence to support a positive relation between rewarding co-worker interactions and meaningfulness  2.4.2 Psychological availability  Psychological availability refers to the sense of having the physical, emotional, or cognitive resources to engage in work role [24 P s y c ho l o gi c a l  engagement theory es j obrel a t e d    Task Conflict Relationship Conflict Psychological Safet y  Knowledge Sharin g  Psychological Availabilit y Engagement Meaningfulness H1 H2a H2b H2c H3b H4a H4b H4c H3a Psychological Engagement Process  Figure 1.

resources are the most important determinant of availability. In line with this, May et al. [2 s empirical research found cognitive resource positively affects psychological availability. They argued that a complex job generally demands more cognitive resources and information processing than an individual can handle. As a result, the presence of sufficient cognitive resources will result in greater psychological availability and engagement  2.4.3 Psychological safety  In safe situations including consistent, nonthreatening, predictable, a nd unequivocal conditions members will have confidence that their organizations will tolerate for any unintentional mistakes On th e co n t rar y in an un s a f e  environment, incumbents make a conclusion that their organization will embarrass, punish or reject someone for making a mistake or speaking up  Kahn s [24 p s y c ho l o gi c a l e n ga ge me nt t h e o r y p u t  forth that open communication climate and interpersonal relationship are antecedents of psychological safety. As Kahn [24 ar gue d   People felt safer in climates characterized by such openness in which members shared ideas and concepts about designs without feeling that it was dangerous to do so  In addition  supportive and trusting interpersonal relationship had a flexibility that allowed people to try and perhaps to fail without fearing the dangerous consequences   A number of empirical studies corroborated the proposition. Brown and Leigh opos ed th at th e  freedom of self-expression is positively related to employees psychological safety. May et  showed that supportive and affective trust-building co-workers relations lead to greater psychological safety. Furthermore, Brown and Leigh ed  that the freedom of self-expression is positively related to employees psychological safety  2.4.4 Relationship conflict and task conflict  Task conflict is defined as an awareness of differences in viewpoints and opinions pertaining to a group task  o cu s e s on h o w bes t to ach ie v e  common objectives. A review of conflict literature showed that task conflict has three major strengths First, previous conflict literature suggested taskoriented conflict endows a task with the characteristics as diversity of knowledge, voice, selfexpression, creativity, and learning. Specifically, task conflict generates a variety of viewpoints of task content issues. Specified task conflict allows members to scrutinize task issues, express their different perspectives, and exercise voice in the decision making processes [2 ron 4] of f e red  evidence that task conflicts encourage people to learn from each other and increase innovative insight Based on the above argument, we expect high task conflict will make members experience more meaningful Second, task conflict connotes the openness of a communication climate in teams. As mentioned before, task conflict provides workers with the chance of self-expression and voice, thus fostering an open climate within the team. Viewed in this light task conflict will be beneficial to psychological safety as it is able to foster an open climate of communication Third, task conflict generates diverse cognitive resources that some people need for completing complex task. Jehn [22 found t h a t c o m p l e x t a s k  requires more complex information processing than an individual can deal with. Task conflict generates and integrates the diverse perspectives of all team members, and the integrative viewpoints are essential cognitive resources for dealing with complex tasks  i n ce task conf lict prov ides div e r s e cogn iti v e  resources, it is expected that it will increase the psychological availability of workers to engage in their work, especially with nonroutine and complex tasks Relationship conflict is relationship-oriented, and it involves personal issues such as dislike among group members and feelings such as animosity annoyance, frustration, and irritation  Relationship conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes \(e.g  t s t u d ies conv erge in t h e f i n d ing t h at  relationship conflict jeopardizes performance \(for a review s h i p con f lic t resu lt i n t h e individuals feeling of threat and anxiety w h ich in turn, reduce their psychological safety. Moreover relationship conflict is expected to decrease individual s social identity and the sense of meaningfulness. Based on the argument above, a set of hypotheses is offered H2  Task conflict positively affects psychological meaningfulness \(H2a\, psychological availability H2b\, and psychological safety\(H2c  H3  Relationship conflict negatively affects meaningfulness \(H3a\ and psychological safety H3b   2.5 Psychological factors and individuals  engagement According to the tenets of psychological engagement theory e th ree ps y c h o lo g i cal  conditions, including meaningfulness, safety and availability, decide the extent to which an individual Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


engages in one s work role. May et al s  empirical research confirmed these propositions They argued that workers who regard their work as meaningful tasks are likely to be motivated to engage themselves in it. Second, team psychological safety will facilitate engagement, because it alleviates excessive concern about teammates negative reactions towards their self employment and self expression which engagement behaviors often have For example, workers may be willing to bring up new ideas only when they believe other co-workers will not fleer or attack them if they get a failure. Third team members will not engage themselves to work if they think they are not capable of doing it. In other words, when recognizing they possess enough physical and cognitive resources, incumbents should be more confident to immerse into work roles. The above argument is captured by the following hypothesis H4  Individuals psychological beliefs including meaningfulness \(H4a\, availability \(H4b\, and safety H4c\itively affect their psychological engagement   2.6 The mediating effects of three psychological factors This part explores the question that whether or not the effects of task and relation conflicts on knowledge sharing are sufficiently explained by different psychological factors? Both conflict and knowledge sharing literature have neglected the examination of such psychological processes. We believe that it could help us better understand how task and relationship conflicts affect knowledge sharing. As mentioned before, given that task conflict is expected to predict three psychological variables meaningfulness, availability, safety\nd these three variables predict engagement, it is obvious that three psychological variables mediate the relationship between task conflict and engagement. Likewise since relationship conflict is expected to predict meaningfulness and safety, it is expected that meaningfulness and safety mediate the relationship between relationship conflict and engagement To complete the study, this research brings forth the following hypotheses. When confirming our hypotheses, we believe that these psychological processes will explain the influence of conflict on more individual-level outcomes H5  Meaningfulness \(H5a\, availability \(H5b\ and psychological safety \(H5c\ mediate task conflict and individuals engagement  H6  Meaningfulness \(H6a\ and psychological safety 6b\ mediate relationship conflict and individuals  engagement  3. Methodology 3.1 Operationalization of Constructs A survey instrument was designed to get information about all of the variables. Wherever possible, existing scales were used or adapted to enhance validity [18  E l se w h e r e  ne w q u e s t i o n s w e r e  developed based on a review of literature. All constructs were measured through seven-point scales anchored from never to very frequently or strongly disagree to strongly agree A summary of operationalization of constructs is listed in Table 1 Given the survey was executed in China, we used a backward translation to ensure consistency between the Chinese and the original English version of the instrument  Previous studies suggest that gender [28  a g e   an d w o rk ex perien ce [26] m a y h a v e an i m pact  on knowledge sharing. The basis of these differences in thinking and behavior may influence the formation of knowledge sharing. In this study, gender, age and experience of participants are included as control variables. Department size, which may affect the individual s free-riding tendency of knowledge sharing als o c o n s id ered as a con t rol v a riable  since the knowledge sharing behavior is usually lower in large departments  3.2 Data Collection  Respondents were recruited in China from 210 part-time MBA students in Shanghai, Suzhou and Hefei. All respondents had similar backgrounds, and were knowledge workers likely to participate in knowledge sharing activities in their firms We sent 210 questionnaires to these respondents and received 144 useful returned questionnaires achieving a response rate of 68.6%. Out of 144 respondents, 23 were female \(16%\t of respondents were in the age of 30 to 39 \(52 Among respondents, 49 had work experiences of 4 to 6 years \(34%\d 51 had work experiences of 1 to 3 years \(35%\ average, respondents worked in the departments of 17.1 employees. We tested the nonresponse bias according to Armstrong and Overton s  e th od. T h e ch is q u a res  of th e f i r s t 25 of th e respondents to that of the final 25% were compared and no differences between these two groups on constructs were indicated by our results  4.

Cronbach s alpha values were found to be greater than 0.7, the threshold suggested by Nunnally   4.1.2 Convergent and Discriminant Validity  We assessed the convergent validity by examining the 1\y of items, 2\posite reliability of constructs, and 3\erage variance extracted \(AVE\ table 1 shows, the loading of all items are up 0.60.

To assess the severity of this problem, confirmatory factor analysis was conduc d s e v e ral models with different numbers of factors were examined. The hypothesized model, containing the seven factors-- task conflict, relationship conflict psychological meaningfulness, psychological safety psychological availability, work engagement and knowledge sharing ---yielded a better fit than the models with fewer factors \(NNFI=0.94, CFI=0.94 NFI=0.91, RMSEA=0.098 x 2 1795 df 758\.

The results of the analysis are presented in Figure 2 As shown in Figure 2, 47.7 % of the variance in knowledge sharing is explained. The results also show that conflicts explain 29.6% of the variance in meaningfulness, 27.1% of the variance in psychological availability, and 21.9% of the variance in psychological safety. And psychological process variables explain 52.5% of the variance in engagement. Control variables were included in the model. The t-value is 0.569 for age, 0.045 for gender 0.398 for experience, and 0.271 for department size None of these control variables were found to be significant As hypothesized, engagement has a significant impact on knowledge sharing behavior \(path coefficient=0.691, t-value=15.145, p<0.01 supporting H1. Task conflict is significantly associated with meaningfulness \(path coefficient=0.367, t-value=8.553, p<0.01 supporting H2a. Task conflict is significantly associated with psychological availability \(path coefficient=0.354, t-value=7.698, p<0.01 supporting H2b. Task conflict is significantly associated with psychological safety \(path coefficient=0.254, t-value=6.262, p<0.05 supporting H2c.

However, we found relationship conflict has a significantly negative impact on psychological availability \(path coefficient= -0.429, t-value=6.870, p<0.01\hich we did not mention in the hypotheses. This interesting finding will be covered in the discussion section. Meaningfulness has a significant impact on engagement \(coefficient=0.314, t-value=6.660 p<0.01\upporting H4a. Psychological availability has a significant impact on engagement \(path coefficient=0.362, t-value=7.835, p<0.01 supporting H4b. Psychological safety has a significant effect on engagement \(path coefficient=0.126, t-value=2.094, p<0.05\. Thus, H4c is supported  4.3 Mediating Effect Tests  To test the mediating effect of the psychological meaningfulness \(MEA\vailability \(PAV\nd safety \(PSA\we adopted Baron and Kenny s three-step method. First, showing that the independent variable \(IV\an directly predict the dependent variable \(DV\econd, showing that IV should significantly predict the mediator \(M\t assessing the significance of the path coefficients between IV and DV when controlling for M. If M is significant but IV is not, M s mediating effect will be full. If both M and IV are significant, M s mediating effect will be partial As Table 3 shows, between the TCO-EN links the mediating effect of meaningfulness, availability and safety is full, H5 is supported. Between the RCOEN links, the mediating effect of meaningfulness is full, and mediating effect of safety is partial. Thus H6 is also supported. The testing results support the above new findings that availability has the full mediating effect on between relationship conflict and engagement  5.

conflict work environment affects their knowledge sharing behavior. The statistical results of this research show that all of our hypotheses are proved Task conflict has significant and positive effects on meaningfulness, availability and safety, which in turn affect workers engagement and knowledge sharing behavior. Relationship conflict has significant and negative effects on meaningfulness and safety, which in turn affect workers engagement and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, meaningfulness, availability and safety were found to significantly mediate the effects of task and relationship conflict and workers  engagement. However, an unexpected finding is that relationship conflict also has a significant and negative effect on psychological availability. One possible explanation is that relationship conflict distracts workers attention. Workers spend too much time and energy on interpersonal attacks so that they have not enough physical or cognitive resources to engage in task per se Previous research indicated task conflict benefits knowledge sharing, whereas relationship conflict damages it. Building on Kahn s framework h i s  research contributes to knowledge sharing literature by opening a black box concerning how two types of conflicts have different effects on knowledge sharing. It addresses the calls for studies to explore the psychological processes that mediate the relationships between contextual antecedents and workers behavi u c h  as kn o w ledg e s h ari n g   Our model delineates a dynamic mechanism between intra-group conflicts, team psychological conditions team engagement and team effectiveness. To a large extent, this research bridges the gap between conflict literature and motivation literature. This research should be a good starting point for exploring the mediating processes by which a set of contextual factors affect knowledge sharing This research also has clear practical implication For instance, in the context of high relationship conflict, managers can take some measures to increase workers psychological meaningfulness safety, and availability, which can buffer the negative effect of relationship conflict on workers knowledge sharing behavior. In contrast, managers should pay great attention on open communication, voice, and learning in task conflict, as these factors will enhance workers psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability and promote their knowledge sharing Our study has several limitations, requiring future research to examine. First, the data is based on selfreport, and the common method variance problem may pose a validity threat. However, confirmatory factor analysis showed that common method variance is not serious. Nonetheless, future research should include data from different sources to address this issue. Moreover, future research should further test our model with longitudinal data, Second, although the measures of all studied variables have been validated and published in the past literature. The items used to measure psychological engagement and psychological safety appeared to be repetitive. Such repetition may undermine the content validity. Future research should adopt more representative measures of the two variables to re-examine our research model. Third, based on the theory of psychological engagement, our theoretical focus is to explore how conflict affects psychological states and psychological engagement, which in turn, influences individual s knowledge sharing behaviors. However the causal relationships of the studied variables could be different. Future research should adopt other theories to examine whether the reverse logics exist The findings should contribute much to knowledge sharing and conflict literature  References  1  R Al b a nes e a nd D D V Fl eet   R a t i ona l  B e ha v i or i n  Groups: The Free-Riding Tendency Academy of Mangement Review vol. 10, pp. 244-255, 1985 2  A C Am a s on  D i s t i ngus i s hi ng t h e ef f e c t s of  f unc t i ona l and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making resolving a paradox for top management teams Academy of Management Journal vol. 39, pp. 123-148 1996 3  J  S Ar m s t r ong a nd T  S O v er t on  E s t i m a t i n g  Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys Journal of Marketing Research vol. 14, pp. 396-402, 1977 4 R  A  B a ro n   P o s i tiv e e ffe cts o f co n f li ct A co g n itiv e perspective Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal vol. 4, pp. 25-36, 1991 5  G W B o c k  R  W Z m ud Y G Ki m  a nd J  N Lee  Behavioral Intention Formation in Knowledge Sharing Examining the Roles of Extrinsic Motivators, SocialPsychological Forces, and Organizational Climate MIS Quarterly vol. 29, pp. 87-111, 2005 6 A  P Brie f  an d W.

Yet one must keep in mind that each document manages an intricate reciprocal relationship between how much the document explicate and the background knowledge people bring to its use Finally, system designers may distinguish circular integration of documents and documents feeding to and from the cycles. People use their central cycles to manage many other document systems. The cycle allows people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices  7.

  13 Second, differences exist in the programmatic consequences between the loss of an Ares I stack and an Ares V stack beyond the replacement cost. Ares I and Orion flight rates could be relatively high to support ISS and lunar missions Replacing one of these stacks would be a matter of accelerating the next launch vehi cle in the pipeline. For the Ares V and Altair, however the replacement could involve more significant delays. The Ares V itself would be a more expensive and more complex vehicle to replace. The Altair lander presents the greatest complexities. A limited number of landers will be produced for the lunar campaign Acquiring an additional repl acement lander could involve the reopening of production lines. In addition, each Altair will be unique to some degree because of the mission objectives and the cargo that it carries. Finally, the cargo itself would need to be repl aced in the event of a loss Summary Comparison Table 13 summarizes the comparison of the three launch options. In this table, the cells that indicate potential negative aspects for each case are highlighted I-V 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227The I-V launch order case resulted in the highest PnSL of the three final cases, with a probability of a missed second launch of 5.4 per mission. However, because of the low cost of failure for this case, it also had the lowest expected vehicle replacement cost at 0.05 AI per mission V-I 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227The V-I option with 4-day EDS and Orion loiter has a PnSL that is similar to that for the I-V option at 4.7%. The PnSL for this case was somewhat lower due to the lower complexity of the second launch vehicle. This case, however, resulted in the greatest expected cost of failure at 0.14 AI. In addition, the V-I launch order includes the additional considerations that involve the pressure to relax flight rules and the difficulty in replacing an Ares V stack V-I 14-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter 227 Of the three options, the V-I 14-day EDS loiter case presented the best PnSL value. The 1.9% PnSL wa s less than half the PnSL for either of the 4-day loiter cas es. However, because of the high cost of failure, the overall expected vehicle replacement cost per mission was similar to that of the I-V 4-day case In evaluating this case, the primary concern, however, was over the other required costs Because of the added boil-off propellant and other described EDS complexities required to support this duration, the baseline 51.0.48 Ares V option was no longer viable. The 51.0.47 Ares V option, with an upgraded capacity, would be required. The DDT&E costs for this upgrade would be large. The cost difference for the Ares V upgrade alone is estimated to be greater than $1B. In addition, the costs to upgrade the EDS, including photovoltaic arrays and MMOD protection, would be added. Although these are one-time DDT&E costs rather than recurring costs, they occu r in a phase of the program where the budget is most restricted In addition, the 51.0.47 design for the Ares V has been reserved as an option in case it is needed because of mass growth or performance uncertainty for the transportation system. If the upgraded design is adopted in the baseline to support a 14-day loiter and a more complex EDS, then no current options are available to provide a hedge against mass growth or performance uncertainty in the transportation system. While further upgrades to the EDS are possible, these upgrades were not considered desirable when the 51.0.48 and 51.0.47 options were down-selected for further consideration by the Constellation Program Because of the requirement to upgrade the Ares V to the 51.0.47 option, as well as the added complexity of the EDS stage, the V-I 14-day loiter case was removed from consideration for the 1\275-launc h launch operational concept While this option offers a significantly lesser PnSL than the other two options at 1.9% ve rsus 4.7% - 5.4%, the added costs and risks associated with this option, particularly costs during the crucial DDT&E period, were determined to be unacceptable. This opinion was reinforced by the results for total expected replacement cost While the V-I 14-day loiter case has a low PnSL, because of the high consequence of failure, the total expected replacement cost was actually somewhat greater than for the I-V 4-day loiter case 10  S ELECTION OF 1 1  2 L AUNCH P OINT OF D EPARTURE O PERATIONAL C ONCEPT  As described previously, the V-I 14-day loiter case was determined by decision makers to involve too much added cost and risk to justify the resultant improvement in PnSL The decision was reinforced by the fact that the second primary metric, the expected cost of failure, was not improved by the V-I case with a longer loiter period The two final cases, the I-V 4-day loiter and the V-I 4-day loiter, were compared; the I-V launch order was selected for the baseline point-of-depar ture architecture The PnSL values, which represent the probability of a failure event during the dual launch phase, were similar for the I-V and V-I cases, at 5.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The expected replacement cost per mission was significantly lower for the I-V case, howev er. Even with the cost uncertainty, the I-V case clearly would likely always result in a lower total cost Crew safety was a major consideration in selecting between the two cases. A clear, quantifia ble added risk to the crew exists in selecting the I-V launch order. The crew would be required to endure an additiona l set of launch, loiter, and EDL events in the case of a missed second launch 


  14 However, because the probab ility of loss of crew is conditional to the PnSL, the overall added risk of 1 in 6,092 is considered to be quite small. This is particularly true when the added risk is compared with the overall risks to the crew that are anticipated for a human lunar mission In addition, although they could not be quantified at this point in time, additional crew risks are associated with the V-I launch order. Although no determination can be made at this point whether these range safety risks may be similar in magnitude to the added risks in the I-V case, they certainly cannot be totally discounted The selected I-V case with a 4-day loiter and 90-minute separation offered the most balanced results across the FOMs that were used in this study. The PnSL of 5.4% was larger than other cases but sim ilar to the PnSL that could be achieved in any case if the Ares V was limited to the 51.0.48 option. The consequence of failure in this case was much less than for the V-I case, which resulted in an expected cost of less than ha lf of that for the V-I launch order In addition, the other complexities that were associated with the V-I launch order\226potential pressure to relax flight rules and the disruptions caused by having to replace an Ares V\226 also trended toward the selection of the I-V launch order 11  P OINT OF D EPARTURE AND U NCERTAINTY  Note that the selected 1\275-launch operational concept represents only a point-of-departu re architecture to be used as a baseline for ongoing lunar architecture studies. It does not represent a final selection of launch order, separation, or loiter period, and NASA is taking no steps to preclude a change in the operational concept in the future In fact, because of the uncerta inty that is involved in the initial design and costing, the possibility exists that, upon further refinement, the parame ters that drive this study could change to a degree that would cause the operational concept to be reconsidered In addition, significant uncertainty exists in the data that were used to generate the Pn SL results in C-RAST. Because the Ares V is still in the early stages of design, large amount of uncertainty still exists as to the launch reliability for the vehicle. As the design matures and more accurate estimates of reliability become available, the operations concept could also be reconsidered In fact, it may ultimately be desirable to develop a 1\275launch system that allows for launch in either order. For the purposes of this study, the Ares V reliability and, therefore the PnSL were treated as consta nt values. Because there is a limited test program for the Ares V before the crewed lunar mission begins, there is liable to be significant growth in reliability for the Ares V over a number of missions. If the initial reliability is low, then the desire would be to launch the Ares V first so that the crew is not launched unnecessarily. Because the values used in this analysis represent the mature steady-stat e estimates, the PnSL for the I-V options could be worse than predicted in this analysis for some number of early missions. If the initial reliability is significantly lower, then it may be desirable to launch initial missions in a V-I order and then switch to I-V as reliability improves To address this uncertainty, an additional set of analyses was completed. In this uncertainty analysis, calculations were made to determine how much each major input parameter would have to change in order to cause the launch option decision to change, if that decision were made on expected replacement cost alone. The analysis was conducted by comparing the final two options: the I-V 4day loiter and the V-I 4-day loiter cases The results of the uncertainty analysis are shown in Table 14. In this table, the current estimate used for each major parameter is listed. Then, the value for each parameter at which the launch order decision \(based on the expected cost of failure\would switch is listed. Generally, the required shifts are large, although the required changes in Table 14 are for single variables only. Simultaneous changes of multiple parameters that are lower in magnitude could also cause a change in the launch order decision The greatest level of uncertain ty in the current analysis involves the transportation element replacement costs Because of the uncertainty involving fixed and marginal costs for Altair and because of the uncertain nature of cost estimates in early design large shifts could potentially occur in the cost data for all elements as the designs mature Table 14. Sensitivity of Launc h Order Decision to Major Parameters Parameter Current Estimate Value at Which Launch Order Would Switch \(if all other values remain constant PnSL I-V 4-day loiter 5.4% 13.5 PnSL V-I 14-day loiter 4.7% 1.9 Cost of Ares I Stack 1.00 AI 2.5 AI Cost of Ares V Stack 2.88 AI 1.15 AI  


  15 In order to represent the impact of uncertainty in the cost data, a \223breakeven\224 cost ratio was determined. The important factor in compari ng expected costs for the I-V and V-I launch orders is not the absolute costs of the Ares I and Ares V stacks but rather the relative costs between the two. Given the predicted PnSL values for the I-V and V-I cases, any set of cost data in wh ich the cost of the Ares V is greater than 115% of the cost of the Ares I will result in the expected replacement cost pe r mission for the I-V option being lower. This relationship is depicted graphically in Figure 6 Figure 6 can be used to determine the resultant optimal launch order for any set of Ares I and Ares V stack replacement costs, based on mini mizing the expected cost of failure. The cost of the Ares V stack is specified on the horizontal axis, and the cost of the Ares I stack is specified on the vertical axis. The sloping red line in the center of the figure represents the break-even cost boundary. If the set of costs is below this line in the light-blue region, then the I-V launch order is preferable. If the set of costs are above the red line in the light-green region, then the V-I launch order is preferable The intent of Figure 6 is to provide a visual indication of how much change could occur in the cost estimates before the launch order decision would be reconsidered. The current cost estimates are represented as a vertical bar on the chart. The Ares I cost is fixed at 1.00 AI. The Ares V cost is represented as a range of 1.65 to 2.88 AI, which represents the full range that is produced by the possible inclusion of fixed costs Across the range of current co st estimates, a large margin still exists before the break-eve n point is reached. Even with no fixed costs included for the Ares V, the Ares V cost would have to decrease by 32%, or the Ares I cost would have to increase by 47% for the cost of failure to be equal for the two cases. These changes seem to be outside the current range of cost uncertainty The Constellation Program has initiated an action to monitor the key parameters identified in this analysis as the transportation element designs continue to mature. If the designs reach a state at wh ich the selected point-ofdeparture operational concept is called into question, then this baseline may be updated 12  S UMMARY  The initial specification of an operational concept for the 1\275-launch solution was largely based on three assumptions First, there was a \223gut reaction\224 that one would not want to risk launching a crew until the EDS and lander were safely in orbit. Second, the assumption was made that the probability of missing the second launch could be substantially reduced by providing a long loiter period for  Figure 6 \226 Relative Ares I and Ares V Stack Costs 


  16 the EDS. Finally, with long EDS loiter periods, the assumption was made that a 24-hour launch separation would have no significant impact on mission success More detailed analysis indicat ed that all three of these assumptions were not entirely accurate. The added risk to the crew, dictated by the c onditional probability of enduring a second launch and encountering a loss-of-crew event, was quite small, especially as compared with the total risk for a human lunar mission The ability to use added loiter to reduce PnSL was largely limited by the Ares V capabilities. Loiter periods of more than four days would require a change to the selected Ares V option \(significantly increasing DDT&E and unit cost and would substantially increase the complexity of the EDS Finally, with shorter loiter periods, the 24-hour launch separation significantly increased the probability of no second launch. The increase in PnSL outweighed the advantages of having a long separation between the launches Taking these limitations into account, the assumed launch order, launch separation, and lo iter duration were called into question. A structured methodology to evaluate the probability of failure, the cost of failure, and the risk to the crew allowed NASA decision makers to methodically compare the options and to se lect a point-of-departure for 1\275-launch operations that would result in the best expected mission performance Loiter durations of greater than four days were determined to be nonviable. The added cost and complexity of the Ares V and the EDS, particularly during the DDT&E period would impose significant affo rdability issues. Although the PnSL could be substantially reduced by increasing the loiter, these improvements did not justify the added complexity With loiter periods limited to four days or less, the 24-hour launch separation was also determined to be nonviable Although switching to a 90-minute separation would impose some operational complexity at launch and could impose some additional risk to the crew in a V-I launch order, these factors were outweighed by the significant penalty to PnSL Finally, the launch order itself was evaluated. With a 4-day loiter, both launch orders resulted in similar values for PnSL. The I-V order would result in some added crew risk in the event of a missed launch, but the magnitude of the added risk was determined to be quite small, especially because the crew would face some indeterminate added flight hazard risk in the V-I option as well. The major discriminator between launch orders was in the expected cost of failure. Because a 1\275-l aunch failure in the V-I order would result in the loss of an Ares V, the EDS, and the Altair lander, the consequence of failure is quite high. A failure in the I-V launch order would result in substantially lower costs to replace the Ares I and an Orion service module and refurbish an Orion crew module. The result of the large difference in relative co sts is that the expected cost of failure is substantially lower for the I-V launch order The results of the study allowed decision makers to select a I-V launch order, with a 90-minute separation and a 4-day EDS/Orion LEO loiter period as the point-of-departure operational concept. This concept will serve as the baseline for ongoing lunar mission development. However, as designs mature and the major parameters used in this analysis are refined, the operational concept for the 1\275launch solution will be further evaluated R EFERENCES    223Expl orat i on Sy st em s Archi t ect ure St udy   Fi nal  R e port 224  NASA-TM-2005-214062, November 2005. url http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/news/E SAS_report.html   Doug C ooke, \223Lunar Archi t ect ure Updat e\224 Nat i onal  Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2007. url http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/190083main_AIAA_ESMD_fin alSPACE2007.pdf 3 Gran t Cates, W illiam Cirillo an d Ch el Stro m g ren   223Lo w  earth orbit rendezvous strategy for lunar missions,\224 Proceedings of the I EEE 2006 Winter Simulation Conference ed.

Figure 11  HIIAPS Data Processing Flow of previous processing systems HIIAPS would both reduce the costs and risk of creating a new processing center Storage Media Disk vs Tape Initially EOSDIS used tape-based storage Now it is slowly transitioning to disk based storage 31 34 T ape is easily transportable has faster read/write speeds but it is sequential access storage and a nearline media 36 37 On the other hand disk has a higher storage capacity per unit makes the data easily accessible online experiences more frequent technology upgrades but has higher electrical costs and is more prone to error 36 37 Disk storage is also more convenient to use because it is random access and data can be kept online as opposed to nearline or of\003ine all the time thus shortening data retrieval times It was been shown that disk storage is more expensive in the short term but in the long term the cost difference between disk and tape systems seems to converge This combined with the f act that ACPS the Ozone Monitoring Instrument Data Processing System OMIDAPS and MODAPS are all disk based storage leads to the conclusion that HIIAPS should also be an entirely disk based system especially with the Kryder's Law disk storage densities double every 23 months taken into account Data Formats As the previous section states it is imperative that HyspIRI data is made available to as many non-remote sensing scientists as possible Part of achieving this goal will be accomplished by distributing the data in a format that is easy to use A standard format would be helpful because it would guarantee that everybody could read that 002le format However there is no single standard format for geospatial data  N ASA  s EOSDIS currently uses HDF-EOS5 which is good for processing but not everyone can easily read the HDF 002le format 40 41 Ev en though there is no standard some formats are more easily accessible than others Using a GIS Geographic Information Systems format like a 003at georeferenced JPEG or PNG image would make HyspIRI data readily accessible to an already large user base and to those who do not use a GIS program The Open GIS Consortium Inc R r OGC is working to solve this formatting issue and towards Open GIS 43 223Open GIS is the full integration of geospatial data into mainstream information technology What this means is that GIS users would be able to freely exchange data over a range of GIS software systems and networks without having to worry about format conversion or proprietary data types Working with the OGC or at least staying in touch with their progress would help to maximize interoperability and accessibility Based on this HyspIRI should have at least two standard data formats One would be HDF-EOS5 because that is the standard NASA EOS format and HIIAPS can draw on pervious NASA experience for it The second would be a GIS ready format like a georeferenced JPEG or PNG to increase accessibility to HyspIRI data This section looked at how HyspIRI might 002t into the EOSDIS framework several previous processing systems and touched on accessibility and interoperability concerns HyspIRI should take advantage of the present EOSDIS infrastructure However HIIAPS should be a stand alone processing center so that HyspIRI's large data volume does not overtax the existing EOSDIS system There are three heritage systems for HIIAPS MODAPS OMIDAPS and ACPS each an the evolution of the next There has been a steady shift from tape-based storage to disk-based storage over the years Thus HIIAPS should use a disk-based storage system In addition to storage and processing distribution is also a concern for the HyspIRI mission HyspIRI data should be made available at no charge to as many people as possible in a manner accessible to as many people as possible Some of the challenges are choosing a data format reaching non-remote sensing scientists and providing the data in an easy to 002nd manner Using Google Earth TM and supplying HyspIRI data products in more than one format will help to solve this challenge 8 C ONCLUSION An end-to-end data system has been described for the HyspIRI mission a high data volume Earth-observing mission With the HyspIRI mission ambitious science objectives are driving the development of a cutting-edge data handling system both on-board the spacecraft and on the ground 18
