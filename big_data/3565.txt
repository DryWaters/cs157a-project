Proceedings ofthe 2003 IEEE Internstionel Conference on Robotics Automation Taipei Taiwan September 14-19 1003 Trajectory Sonar Perception Richard J Rikoski and John J Leonard Marine Robotics Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Mass Ave Cambridge MA 02139 rikoski jleonard AbstracbThis paper describes a new data association technique for the interpretation of wide-heam sonar mea surements. The goal is 
to group sets of returns that originate from the same surface of an object We consider the case of a moving observer that obtains range and hearing mea surements of curved and/or faceted objects with a binaural sonar operating in the specular wavelength regime Rather than projecting sensor data into a Cartesian space before processing we operate on a 224raw\224 representation in terms of range, hearing, amplitude and time A binary geometric constraint is applied to pairs 
of consecutive measurements to rule out impossible assignments A measurement flow model is proposed for validating triples of measurements The performance of these techniques is illustrated via a set of experiments using a wide-beam 500 kHz binaural sonar system demonstrating effective perceptual grouping and mapping with sonar echoes originating from a set of objects, despite the presence of navigation error Fig 1 Odyssey 111 AUV with SAS sensor 
I Introduction Reliable, sonar based perception is crucial if robots are to perform useful tasks in the ocean Undersea sonar data however is not easy to interpret The dominant approach for undersea sonar processing is based on 223imaging\224 Undersea sonars are often designed to create as large an aperture as possible, resulting in narrow beampattems These beams can then be steered either mechanically or electronically to produce a visual representation of the scene  an image. Most interpretation is either perform manually by human operators 
or automatically by image processing algorithms such as shadow detection Common examples of imaging undersea acoustic sensors include side-scan sonars, forward-look sonars and mechanically scanned sonars This paper considers sonar interpretation in the context of an alternate framework that is not based on conven tional imaging. Rather, we advocate a geometric approach based on the interpretation of echoes from a wide-beam sensor obtained from multiple vantage points We believe the geometrical wide-beam approach to sonar is interesting for several reasons From a scientific perspective this model holds 
a closer relationship to hypothesized models of bat and dolphin echolocation I Bats and dolphins demonstrate astounding feats of sonar based prey tracking and obstacle avoidance using wide sonar beams and adaptive sensing and motion strategies Mechanisms of bio1,ogical echolocation remain poorly un derstood, however the 223sensor design\224 principles at work are clearky different from typical undersea commercial sonars From a technical perspective for many problems it is impossible to build a large enough aperture to allow effective imaging at desired frequencies One motivating scenario for our 
work is the detection of buried mines us ing a synthetic aperture sonar SAS in the generic ocean array technology sonar GOATS concept 7 Figure 2 shows an example set of received signals obtained from a dual line may SAS system mounted on an Odyssey 111 AUV as shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows detector output for these waveforms Previous work in synthetic aperture sonar SAS pro cessing is related to the approach taken 
in this paper However in most work in SAS the implicit goal is to produce an 223image\224 of the scattered field A difficult issue in SAS processing is to account for navigation error of the sensor 23 Signal processing techniques used to form images rely on very accurate positioning information Methods have been developed to extract short-term accurate position information directly from the data e.g using digital phase correlation analysis 71 0-7803-7736-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 963

In our approach we consider sensor navigation error as an intrinsic part of the processing We seek to develop sonar interpretation methods that are tolerant to significant levels of navigation error One of the key issues in a geometrical approach to sonar data interpretation is the correspondence problem The goal is to associate measurements obtained from multiple vantage points with the same featurelobject in a scene Previous approaches have considered the corre spondence problem in conjunction with the object clas sification and mapping problems 17 There are several problems with this type of approach Typically only a very small set of models can he used e.g. point features planar features cylinders of known radius Methods that attempt joint associatiodclassificatiodmapping can encounter extreme levels of computation complexity 17 especially when navigation error is present In a specular wavelength regime the received signals consist of a set of discrete echoes For example one early model for acoustic echo formation was presented by Freedman SI Basically Freedman\222s method predicts that when a sonar pulse is incident on a generally smooth but possibly faceted object the returned waveform will be comprised of a discrete number of image pulses which are time-delayed and attenuated replicas of the incident pulse This simplified physical model of the sonar sensing process is based on the geometrical acoustics high-frequency approximation of acoustic scattering For land robotics applications, several researchers have designed sonar interpretation methods using static or scanning sonar mays of various configurations Exam ples include work by Barshan and Kuc Z Bozma and Kuc 41 Kleeman and Kuc 121 Peremans et al 191 and Heale and Kleeman IO These methods have been very successful for various tasks such as land robot nav igation and mapping In general, however these methods decompose the environment into a few simple geometric primitives such as points planes and cylinders In our work we seek to define more general methods that can apply to mapping navigation and detection tasks in less structured undersea environments In this paper we describe a technique for associating sonar echoes obtained from multiple vantage points before feature modelling is attempted The key idea is basically one of continuity We develop constraints on how mea sured range and bearing can change when curved objects are observed from multiple vantage points Flat surfaces and point objects represent limits of infinite and zero curvature The structure of this paper is as follows Section I1 motivates the representation of sonar measurements in terms of 223echo trajectories\224 with an example from a tank experiment Section 111 describes the sensor and signal processing to extract returns from sonar signals Sections IV and V present a binary constraint and a 223measurement flow\224 model that when combined together provide a method for effective segmentation before mod eling Section VI illustrates the use of the segmentation technique for mapping and classification with navigation uncertainty. Finally, Section VI1 concludes the paper with a discussion of future research issues 11 Representation Many approaches transform data into a Cartesian frame at a very early level For example Figure 5 shows a Cartesian projection of a set of sonar returns obtained from 25 positions with a 500 kHz binaural sonar system in a testing tank We believe that this representation obscures the natural temporal structure of the data and instead advocate visualization of the data as a sequence of raw measurements tokens These raw measurement tokens can he thought of as points in an appropriately dimensioned space The different axes in such a representation could be range azimuth angle elevation angle, amplitude and time Figure 6 shows the same measurements with range as a function of time sensor position Our hypothesis is that with this representation the correspondence of measurements can be more easily ascertained We believe that it is easier to find regularities 20 21 15 in such spaces 223measurement trajectories\224 rather than by looking for structure in a Cartesian representation of the data \(Figure 5 To properly take advantage of this temporal struc ture the robot must have a representation of where it was when it made the measurements Towards this end we employ techniques for concurrent mapping and localization CML that incorporate both temporal and spatial correlations ZZ By providing the robot with an explicitly correlated history of its positions it can properly accommodate sensor and navigation uncertainty when transforming measurement trajectories into features in world coordinates 111 Sensor Processing A binaural sonar I41 was used to measure the range and hearing to targets A binaural sonar is a simple line array with a central transmitting transducer and two receiving 224ear\224 transducers. Detection was performed using the method employed by Kuc 14 First the signal was rectified logarithmically compressed, and low-pass 965

This is anal ogous to the binary constraints employed in visual object recognition 9 Previous work in robotics such as Barshan and Kuc 121 has considered the design of novel array con figurations to perform classification of different feature types such as comers vs planes. Rather than considering a finite set of feature types we seek to associate mea surements that originate from the same object for a more general object model i.e curves before classification is performed The key issue is the relationship between the number of degrees of freedom of the unknown feature vs. the the number of degrees of freedom that ae constrained by the sensor measurement We consider a two dimensional en vironment and a sonar which provides range and bearing measurements of objects We denote the sensory degrees of freedom by m and the number of degrees of freedom of the feature by n We consider the case of measuring curved objects in a two-dimensional environment in a specular wavelength regime In such an environment, with each sonar measure ment we can associate a "contact point x y and a local curvature p We designate the local center of curvature as xc,yc Points can be represented by the limiting case when p  0 Planes are the limiting case when p  m 966 


With range and angle measurements from a single loca tion only curvature cannot he estimated; the feature state is only pmially observable from a single measurement The robot can only use the two geometric degrees of freedom so ml  2 and n  3 A second measurement with m2 degrees of freedom must lie in some region of the ma-dimensional measure ment space How well the second measurement can be predicted depends on n  ml If n  ml  0 then a second measurement of the feature from a new location can he fully predicted If n  ml  0 there are n  mi unconstrained degrees of freedom A second measurement from a new location cannot be fully predicted. For this case if ma  n ml the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom exceeds the number of degrees of second measurement and no strong constraints can be imposed on it exempting special circumstances such as a stationary robot in a static environment However, if ms  n  mi or n  ml+mz then the second measurement can he constrained to lie upon some function in measurement space. If it is assumed that m1  mz  m then if m  n  Zm given a prior measurement it is possible to predict some function that a second measurement must lie on For the most general case if k  l  n  km then a minimum of k  1 measurements are needed to find a constraint function for the kth measurement of a feature In general to avoid a combinatorial explosion it is preferable to design a sensor such that 2m  n We now consider the application of these general principles to the case of a binaural sensor in a 2-D environment with curved objects Given an initial robot position an initial range and bearing measurement to a surface, and a second robot position a pair-wise constraint test can be applied as follows pis the unknown variable in this 2D analysis First the state of the circle is calculated as a function of the unknown variable p Xc\(p  Xt.1  Ti  P COS  01 3 Y  yT1  TI  P sin  QI 4 Then a predicted measurement is made using c\(P Yc\(P tab  J\(zc  z  Yc  Yd2  P 5 1-02 6 p  arctm\(L Y Y72 Xc  XP2 assuming that rC does not equal zr2 value it is a function of the unknown variable The innovation is calculated hut instead of having a The Mahalanobis distance also becomes a function of the unknown variable p Y\(P  v\(P P P 8 If the minimum value of p is below an appropriate threshold, the robot cannot de out a possible correspon dence between two measurements At this stage, the robot is not trying to accurately assign correspondence it is merely trying to eliminate the most unlikely correspon dences If objects are assumed to be locally curved then sequential observations of such objects can utilize this curvature constraint V A Measurement Flow Model Although the binary constraint from the previous sec tion can rule out some correspondences it does not yield very good results on its own To improve its performance its output is passed to a function which tests threesomes of measurements From a Lagrangian perspective a measurement can be predicted as a Taylor series expansion of substantial derivatives This is similar to the derivation for optical flow ill DT At2 Dz Dt 2 Dt2 Ti  To At    h.0.t 9 10 D\(Y Dt 1  YO  At  hat In the above example we assume a two dimensional environment where T is the measured range and Y is the measured hearing The first and second substantial derivatives are defined as 181 Assuming a locally curved feature with an unknown curvature p and an unknown center of curvature xC yc the measurement model is 967

appear complex and hard-to-interpret when considered via Cartesian projection are much easier to explain us ing segmented echo trajectories The system incorporates automatic fixation which we believe is an essential part of this type of sonar interpretation approach This has been applied for example to good success in Kuc's work on object recognition 14 The problem of balancing multiple fixations is an unexplored problem \(for example observation of known objects to provide good navigation vs observation of unknown objects for mapping Future work will address 1 3-D tracking 2 the incorporation of spectral information and 3 extension to rough surfaces The primary motivating application for this work detection of undersea buried mines via low frequency synthetic aperture sonar is inherently a 3-D problem Recently we have obtained a large amount of data at the GOATS 2002 experiment using a synthetic aperture sonar that provides this information via use of two eight-element arrays The formulae presented in this paper apply in two dimensions the three dimensional equivalents are presently being derived and tested and initially results are very promising The issues of exploiting spectral information and cop ing with rough surfaces are inter-related The study of echo reflection from rough surfaces has been studied by Bozma and Kuc 3 The matching of new data to previ ously mapped features \(for recognition andlor navigation purposes is tremendously important This paper has not addressed this issue, hut it is anticipated that the trajectory segmentation method will be a valuable tool for early processing as input to recognizing previously mapped features Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to the entire MIT GOATS 2002 team, including H Schmidt P Newman M Bosse D Eickstedt J Edwards W Xu T.C Liu R.
