The big challenge of dealing with spiking neural networks is getting data into and out of them which requires proper encoding and decoding methods Presented in this paper is an adaptation of Izhikevich\222s model of a polychronous spiking network and an encoding scheme for real valued data. Data is chosen arbitrarily to cover the range of the encoding scheme in order to best demonstrate the network\222s response to different inputs. Preliminary results 
show that the network is able to recognize distinct input values and respond to them with unique spiking patterns I  I NTRODUCTION  AST work with an abstracted model of a spiking neuron in [1 ha s sho w n p o t e nt i a l fo r  use i n ne ur o i d e nt i f i c a t i o n  improving on a traditional MLP in both precision and accuracy. However, the abstracted model amounts to little more than a more complicated activation function. In order to truly harness the power of a spiking neuron, it is probable that a more biologically faithful, literal model must be tried  Many different spiking neural network algorithms have been designed with an eye towards real-number function approximation.

This is a very linear network, in that its precision is directly correlated to the number of spiking neurons present.

The encoding neurons in Hopfield\222s model use an oscillatory background to provide a baseline pulse against which the timing of input spikes may be measured. The encoding is thus accomplished in the timing of the spikes.

It demonstrates many activities and behaviors common to real brains, and the encoding method introduced in this study relies on spatial as well as temporal mechanisms in the neural pool  The Izhikevich neuron model introduced in [8

This polychronous spiking network \(PSN\tilizes these delayed synaptic connections to cause the timing of 
multiple neurons\222 firings to be important in determining whether a given secondary neuron fires. Such behavior could allow for rapid recognition of patterns, with a single neuron\222s spiking output being a flagged result of a pattern of other neurons reacting to stimulus, resulting in very fast brain-like identification of and reaction to particular complex stimuli [10 In th is p a p e r th e P S N\222 s ab ilit y to  respond to encoded, meaningful information is explored with an eye towards achieving function approximation with a PSN In order to test the encoding scheme, it is necessary to choose some test inputs. These numbers may be selected arbitrarily, but should be reas onably well-spaced from each other across the interval of numbers which can be encoded This allows the output response of the PSN to be examined 
across the range the encoding scheme can handle. It is desirous that the output responses of the PSN be distinct for different inputs; this behavior would indicate that the encoding method is successfully inputting meaningful information into the network  In the next section, the Izhikevich equations are discussed as is the mechanism whereby synaptic delays are introduced Encoding Real Values into Po lychronous Spiking Networks Cameron Johnson Student Member, IEEE and G.

002  002 212  The variables a, b, c and d control the spiking behavior of the Izhikevich neuron. Variables a and b control the sensitivity of the neuron to increasing voltage and how quickly it can be ready to spike again after having spiked once, while c and d are reset-control variables.  The thalamic input I is where the affects of other neurons\222 spiking, as well as ambient electrical noise, are injected into the neuron. In other words, this is what causes a neuron to gain charge on its soma, making it possible for it to spike at all. The value of I is the total influx of spiking information \(after all synaptic delays have been accounted for\ into the neuron at time step k Eq. \(1\ives the update model for the voltage v  on the soma at any discrete time k and \(2\ gives the update model for the decay value u at the same instant k in order to keep the neuron model behaving like a real spiking neuron  B  Performance of the Izhikevich Model In Izhikevich\222s Spiking Neural Network \(SNN\ model, a sparsely-connected pool of these neurons are initialized with random synaptic weights, connecting them with roughly 10% of the other neurons in the pool. In preparation to compare to the PSN and the PSN with encoded real-valued inputs, this SNN was run for one simulated second, with a time-step of 1ms, as shown in Fig. 1. The thalamic input I is stimulated with random noise on top of the spikes incoming from connected neurons. See o r th e ac tu al Matlab cod e  used to generate Fig. 1. Neurons 1 through 800 are excitatory, and neurons 801 thro ugh 1000 are inhibitory  The PSN code introduced in [9 d s sy n a p tic d e la y s to  the neural communications. The delays are randomly determined, but fixed once set. The synaptic weights, on the other hand, are trained via spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP\hich is a method that encourages connections that seem to trigger spikes to strengthen, and causes connections which carry spikes that accomplish nothing to decay. The code needs to run for roughly six hours of simulated time before the weights are trained enough for use. Fortunately there is no need to initialize the PSN\222s synaptic weights randomly each time the code is used; by storing the trained weights to use as the starting point for the PSN code, only one such six-hour \(simulated time\ session is required   As potentially exciting as Izhikevich\222s PSN model is however, as presented it is a model that produces pretty spiking patterns, mainly of interest only to neurobiologists This paper attempts to make it of interest to the Computational Intelligence \(CI\mmunity by exploring means of inputting data into the spiking neural network. The eventual goal, perhaps obviously, is extracting data from the network, in order to use the PSN as a function approximator much as better-established neural networks are utilized today\ is hoped that the PSN\222s more powerful modeling of living brain activity, once harnessed, will prove to be a much more powerful neural network than those currently considered \223standard.\224  The most obvious place to inject real data into the network neurons is in the thalamic input. The variable I is where the neuron receives external input, whether from other neurons connected via synapses or from the random thalamic noise. So, if the real data is to be injected via I the question arises as to how essential the thalamic input \226 the random noise \226 is to the function of the PSN. As Fig. 2 shows, without any sort of external stimulus to the neurons the network does not respond at all  Fig. 1.  Izhikevich Matlab model output: 1000 neurons firing over 1000ms. Each dot represents that neuron firing during that millisecond    A sample of how the code functions with random thalamic excitations is demonstrated, so that it may be contrasted with the third section of this paper, which unveils a possible method for encoding data into the PSN and demonstrates the performance of the Izhikevich model of a PSN when given real values so encoded. The paper then concludes with a discussion of decoding mechanisms and challenges of using a PSN for function approximation II  I ZHIKEVICH M ODEL OF A P OLYCHRONOUS S PIKING N ETWORK  A  Mathematical Model This neuron model, developed by Izhikevich in [8  use s  equations \(1\d \(2\ govern the charge on a single neuron, as well as to monitor its firing output 2  1 0.04  1 5  1 if 30mV    140  1 1 if 30mV vk v k vk v vk uk I v c 212 212\212 212  212   if 30mV 1 1\\(1  2 if 30mV 1 v uk abvk uk uk v uk d  212 212 212  


    Fig. 2.  One second of the PSN with no thalamic stimulation and no input   Thus, some form of external stimulus is required to get the PSN to do anything. As will soon be seen, providing external stimulus in the form of the desired input data has definite impact on the spiking behavior of the PSN. Before real values can be injected into the network, however, some method of encoding that data into a form useable by the spiking neurons must be developed III  E NCODING R EAL V ALUES FOR A PSN  The PSN used in this experiment consists of 1000 spiking neurons. Of these, 800 are excitatory and the remaining 200 are inhibitory. Twenty-four neurons are chosen to be input channels through which external excitation can be applied to the network  These 24 input neurons are chosen from the reservoir of 800 excitatory neurons, and these encoded spike patterns are injected directly into the thalamic input variable I in \(1\he output of all 800 excitatory neurons and all 200 inhibitory neurons is then monitored. Fig. 3 shows the conceptualization of the 24-neuron, 12-bit encoding with the spiking neuron pool as a dynamic reservoir, as well as eight randomly selected neurons whose outputs are monitored    Fig. 3. Input neuron concept. 24 neurons used to encode 12 bits. The number of bits of resolution is arbitrarily chosen; the re quirement is two neurons per bit. e.g., for 32 bit resolution, 64 input neurons must be chosen 


   A  Encoding Scheme The experimental input method is to utilize grey code to convert the numerical input we wish to give the PSN into patterns of spiking inputs. The precise method chosen is to utilize 11 bits to encode numbers from 0 to 10, and a 12 th bit to serve as a sign, thus allowing for a range of -3 to 3 for the experiments presented here. A 12-bit encoding scheme is chosen for compatibility with the real-time digital simulator RTDS\ailable in the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems \(RTPIS\ab for future real-time simulations. Gray Coding is used to ensure that changes from one value to the next have minimal difference in the input pattern, and thus any continuous topology in the network can be taken advantage of. Twenty-four neurons out of a pool of 1000 are used as the inputs Fig. 4 illustrates how each bit has two neurons to which its input goes: one neuron receives a spike when the bit is 2231,\224 the other receives a spike when the bit is \2230.\224 If no input is being given, none of the input neurons receive external spikes. There is no \223random noise\224 introduced into these thalamic inputs; all spiking responses are strictly to the input patterns    Fig. 4. Encoding scheme for the 24 neurons, with example inputs and their meanings. These 24 neurons represent 12 bits, which are used to input real values in a gray code B  Response of PSN to Sample Encoded Values  With the means of encoding data established, the experiment can be performed. In this paper, input patterns representing -3 2 0 2 and 3 have been chosen In Fig. 5 through Fig. 11, the PSN is initialized with the synaptic weights that had been trained for six simulated hours. In the first millisecond of the simulation, the input is presented; the remaining simulation time simply shows the spiking response pattern of the network  Fig. 5. -3 input for 1 ms. \(a\piking response of each neuron. \(b\otal number of neurons firing each millisecond  Fig. 6. -2 input for 1 ms. \(a\piking response of each neuron. \(b\otal number of neurons firing each millisecond Every neuron in the PSN is monitored for its spiking response, whether excitatory or inhibitory, and whether it is an input neuron or not. As before, neurons 1 through 800 are excitatory, and neurons 801 through 1000 are inhibitory Neurons 1 through 24 receive the encoded stimulus in the first millisecond. The bottom graph in each of the figures simply shows how many neurons fired in any given millisecond

Of particular note is the fact that each of these response patterns are unique. Thus, there is definite recognition in the network of different inputs However, the question arises: are these outputs stable The answer is \223yes,\224 at least to a certain degree. Further experiments applying the same input repeatedly, without resetting the synaptic weights \(and thus allowing them to adapt according to STDP\iel ds identical output patterns over the first six repetitions \(with one input presented every 200 ms\ the seventh, there is a mild alteration to the trailing end of the spiking response, as can be seen clearly in Fig. 12 when compared one-by-one to the corresponding Fig. 11. While experiments were done with the other input values \(-3 through 2 ig. 12 in comparison to Fig. 11 is typical. Perhaps even more interesting, when presentations were continued out to as many as 80 iterations, at 200 ms between presentations, the output pattern remained the same 


   as the seventh, implying that, at least to that point, the outputs are stable even while STDP training is occurring  Fig. 12. 3 input for 1 ms on the 7th iteration of the same input without resetting the synaptic weights. This is the first iteration that shows a different response from the first presentation, and no iterations after this 7th one are different from this 7th one. \(a\piking response of each neuron. \(b total number of neurons firing each millisecond  As illustrative as the pictures of the spiking response are they may be deceptive. Further analysis of the PSN\222s response to the chosen input set to determine just how unique the responses are has been done by examining exactly which neurons fired in response to each stimulus. To simplify analysis, only whether a given neuron fired at all is considered; if it fired more than once, it still only counts once. Table I shows a count of the number of unique neurons which fired for both the stimulus represented in the row and in the column of each cell. Thus, the diagonal gives the total number of neurons that fired at least once for a given input stimulus \(since, for instance, every neuron that fired in response to 3 also fired in response to 3 so there is 100% overlap\ile Table I does not provide sufficient information to decode outputs, the dissimilarity in which neurons fired in response to a given input indicates that the different inputs are encoded in a way that the PSN recognizes as distinct and different  TABLE  I N UMBER OF S HARED N EURAL F IRINGS B ETWEEN S AMPLE I NPUTS  3 2 0 2 3  3  36 11 8 9 7 10 36 2  11 54 15 11 13 39 11  8 15 44 8 36 17 9 0 9 11 8 40 10 14 11  7 13 36 10 46 16 9 2  10 39 17 14 16 74 11 3  36 11 9 11 9 11 39  To further analyze the data presented in Table I, Fig. 13 is a bar graph representing the number of unique neural firings each stimulus caused. This corresponds to the diagonal values in Table I. Fig. 14 represents Table I as a threedimensional bar graph. Looking at these, it becomes clear that there is sufficient uniqueness between the firing patterns of the PSN in response to the different inputs that one can declare that the PSN has, in fact, recognized them as different   Fig. 13. A count of unique neural firings for different encoded inputs   Fig. 14. The number of neurons which fired for two given encoded inputs The sharp drop-off in numbers of shared neural firings between two nonidentical inputs is a good sign that the firing patterns are unique to each input pattern  Fewer shared neurons firing than neurons fired for any single input indicates that there are a number of neurons that only fire for one input, and not others. While increasing the number of inputs in the testing set will likely lead to finding more input patterns that a given neuron will react to, the unique combinations of neural firing patterns will be sufficiently rich for the PSN to demonstrate its understanding of the encoded input  IV  D ECODING   T HE K EY TO F UNCTION A PPROXIMATION  This simple encoding produces patterns that can be identified with specific inputs, which can lead to powerful classifiers. Work has been done with spiking networks as classifiers p li s h ing  s u ch  th i n g s a s  u s i n g an SNN to enact the XOR function, and the results shown above indicate that, with proper identification tools on the decoding end, the PSN could mimic this level of categorization However, the goal of this encoding method is not simple classification. To the knowledge of the authors, there has been no successful work thus far in performing continuous function approximation using spiking neurons. It is the belief 


   of the authors that, with appropriate decoding, such function approximation is within the capability of the PSN While there is sufficient demonstration of the uniqueness of the firing patterns of the PSN shown in Table I and Figs 13 and 14, identifying the unique response patterns is still a challenge without doing mere pattern-matching. Information lost in the analysis in Section III includes how many times any given neuron fired \(other than \223not at all\224 or \223at least once\224\d the timing of the spikes, both of which are further unique identifiers which may aid in determining how the PSN processes the encoded inputs The exact method of decoding is the subject of ongoing research. Hopfield\222s coincidence-detection method is worth investigating, but the sheer volume of PSN spikes makes this prohibitive as a first step [3 Cu rren t l y  w o rk i s b e in g d o n e  to explore similarities between Radial Basis Function \(RBF networks and the patterns of output spikes demonstrated by the PSN, in hopes that the similarity between the SNN used in d R B F f u n ctio n s  m i g h t lead to a break th roug h o n  decoding the PSN\222s spike patterns. One possible way to look at the PSN is as a form of echo-state network \(ESN\which also has similarities to an RBF The trick, in this form of decoding, would seem to be to determine how the spike patterns respond to a large enough set of training inputs. Then, using a clustering mechanism such as k means, the inputs and outputs would be classified and the only thing that needs online training would be the output weights used to ultimately translate the spike patterns into meaningful output data. In this fashion, it is hoped to translate the discrete classification space into a continuous function space  V  C ONCLUSION  Real data has been successfully encoded and propagated through a polychronous spiking network. The PSN has been shown to have unique, repeatable spiking patterns in response to any given input. Such patterns can be used to identify categorically what input the PSN received, and thus show that the PSN is as capable of categorization problems as other SNN works. Because the encoding method chosen has a 12 bit granularity, there are 2 12 possible inputs, each of which has a unique output, leading to very powerful classification capabilities The challenge the authors have taken on, however, is to move beyond this preliminary progress with the PSN, and demonstrate that, with proper decoding mechanisms, the PSN can be a function approximator in continuous state space. While this work is still underway, there are several promising avenues of research under investigation, with exciting possible ties to both echo state network, liquid state machine and radial basis function network models. With the PSN demonstrated to be able to take real-valued data and operate on it in repeatable fashions, it is perhaps the closest spiking neural network model to realizing the promise of SNNs in general: biological faithfulness yielding increasing scalability and power     R EFERENCES   1  C.

Modified Estimation of 0Day vulnerabilities in Existence  The 0Day estimations discussed in the previous section were based on a lifespan that begins with vendor notification and ends with a public announcement. However, this represents only a portion of the true lifespan which actually begins with vulnerability discovery. Unfortunately, the date of initial discovery is usually not known nor as well documented as the vendor notification date. As explained in section 2.9, the NVD database has discovery date" records for a small fraction of its entries, and for the cases where there is a recorded Figure 6.

discovery date, the validity of the data is suspect therefore "discovery date" data from the NVD database could not be used to estimate 0Day lifespan A small but intriguing set of 15 vulnerability lifespans was supplied to us by a research group that does vulnerability discovery. We cannot disclose the identity of the research group, and there is no evidence that these 15 lifespans are representative of all 0Day vulnerabilities. However, these lifespans were included in our study because they are the elapsed time from actual discovery date to public announcement date These same 15 vulnerabilities were also discovered independently and publicly disclosed by a different research group, which provides some added assurance that the lifespan data is valid. Figure 8 is a histogram that shows the lifespan data for these 15 vulnerabilities The average 0Day lifespan for these 15 vulnerabilities is 256 days and the median lifespan is 200 days. As expected, the average lifespan is larger than the lifespans discussed in the previous sections and would be expected to result in larger estimates for the number of 0Day vulnerabilities in existence   The 15 lifespans described above were used to estimate the number of 0Day vulnerabilities in existence. The estimates were calculated using the NVD public announcement dates and the method in Figure 4 but with lifespan samples obtained by a uniform random selection from the 15 lifespans. The results are shown in Figure 9. The results show that the new estimate for the worst year \(2006\ about 4500 0Day vulnerabilities in existence on any given day This is a less conservative estimate than the results from the previous section and since the lifespan dataset is small it should not be considered a high confidence         0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 Lifetime \(days Number of Occurences Figure 8.

estimate. However, since these 15 lifespans begin at the moment of discovery rather than the vendor notification date, this estimate could very well be more realistic  6. CVSS Base Score and 0Day Lifespans  Given the estimations of the number of 0Day vulnerabilities and their lifespans it is important to ask whether the estimates may be misleading about the risk 0Days pose. If the lifespans are very long for low impact, difficult to exploit, vulnerabilities but very short for high impact, easy to exploit, vulnerabilities then the risk would be lower than the raw numbers lead us to believe. To evaluate this possibility we used the 405 0Day vulnerabilities from ZDI and iDefense which had a CVSS Base score assignment, and broke them into categories based on their score. CVSS is an industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities The CVSS Base score consists of a weighting of the impact and exploitability subscores. The impact subscore is an evaluation of the potential impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability from exploitation of the vulnerability. The exploitability subscore is an assessment of the complexity of actual exploitation. This includes measures such as whether the attacker may exploit the vulnerability remotely how complex the actual attack process is expected to be, and the required number of authentications during attack execution. Details of the CVSS Base score may be found in the CVSS scoring gui We expected to find that the vulnerabilities which are easily exploitable and have a high impact \(very high CVSS Base scores\ would have significantly shorter lifespans since it would seem to be in the software owner s and vendor s interest to have the vendor devote their limited resources to fixing them quickly  Table 4.

Upon investigation of the exception we found in ZDI NEW, we discovered that the higher average lifespan value in the low severity category was due to a single vulnerability with a CVSS Base score of 7.8 and a very long lifespan. It is interesting to note that with all of the 0Day vulnerability data sets combined, the mean lifespan of the high severity vulnerabilities are about 30% longer than the low severity cases. This is just the opposite of what would be hoped for from a security perspective Rather than use the two, somewhat ad-hoc, CVSS Base score categories found in Table 4, we decided that for the sake of validation and completeness we would do the same analysis as before but make use of the low, medium, and high severity categories as formally defined in the CVSS documentation. This change lead to the categories and analysis results seen in Table 5. In this case all four data sets show a longer lifespan for the high severity vulnerabilities, and the combined data set shows that the medium severity vulnerabilities have a lifespan approximately 20 longer than the low severity vulnerabilities and the Figure 9.

The question of 0Days with high CVSS base scores having longer lifespans may simply be an artifact of the data we used, or it may be real and be caused by some hidden attribute of the process such as a greater difficulty in developing patches for the more serious vulnerabilities    7. Conclusions  We demonstrated a method for estimating the number of past 0Day vulnerabilities. In the worst year 2006\e conservatively estimated that there was an average of 2500 0Days in existence on any given day Using a much smaller vulnerability data set, but one where the calculated vulnerability lifespans ranged from the moment of discovery to the date of public announcement, we more aggressively estimated that there was an average of 4500 0Day vulnerabilities in existence on any given day during the worst year 2006\These estimates are first order approximations that are subject to change as more data becomes available We also provided preliminary evidence that the most serious of these 0Day vulnerabilities have longer lifespans than lower severity vulnerabilities Consequently, 0Day vulnerabilities appear to represent a greater risk to our systems than even the estimated number of 0Day vulnerabilities would indicate  8. Future Work  We are pursuing investigation into a variety of issues related to estimating both the past and current number of 0Day vulnerabilities, the risk they may pose to a variety of systems, and potential mitigations. The work includes the modification and application of the research described in this paper to individual software programs. This will then be followed by an investigation in applying the attack surface metric concept to systems Further, critical infrastructure control systems make use of many programs which are not pervasive and thus they have not undergone the vigorous assault of the larger security research community Consequently the vulnerabilit y data related to control system software is expected to require a modified approach for characterizing the lifespans and for estimating the number of 0Day vulnerabilities Of course the risk posed to systems from 0Day attacks rest not just on the number of 0Day vulnerabilities but also on how easy it is to acquire the desired vulnerability. The ease of acquisition is impacted not just by how many potential attackers are aware of it, but also by the markets available for both buying and selling the 0Day vulnerabilities. This impact will be investigated Also, the number of 0Day vulnerabilities and their lifespans may impact the form of an optimal disclosure process which minimizes the risk window particularly to our most sensitive critical infrastructure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 11 
 


systems. Thus, the relation of 0Days to control system vulnerability disclosure will be investigated The question of 0Days with high CVSS Base scores having longer lifespans will also be investigated further to determine whether it is simply an artifact of the data we used, whether it relates to the difficulty in developing patches for the more serious vulnerabilities or whether the more significant vulnerabilities are more closely guarded by the discoverer We are in the process of acquiring many more 0Day vulnerability discovery and public announcement dates from firms and individuals who make the discovery themselves. This data will be used to create an improved estimate of the lifespan of a 0Day vulnerability from initial discovery to public announcement  9.

interact with strategic and structural properties of a firm Also, as we see growing amounts of regulation and stronger public reactions to how firms conduct their business, compliance issues have received increased attention. Especially from an IT governance perspective, two questions are exciting to ask: How are alignment and compliance related, i.e. to what extent can or should the dimensions of alignment be an explicit part of compliance activities? And one step further: As regulation regarding internal controls like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the USA affects almost all IT activities [61] this is a highly relevant issue. From an IT business value perspective, IT business alignment may be a driver but IT compliance may act as a constraint In practice, combining the demands for compliance and value delivery of IT is widely seen as the domain of IT governance [43]. This leads to the second question: Is there a positive business value impact from compliance beside just being compliant, i.e. do improvements from better governance/alignment structures and actions would have been worth the effort even without external regulatory pressure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 References   1] Alavi, M. and Leidner, D.E., "Review: Knowledge Management and Knowledge Management Systems: Conceptual Foundations and Research Issues", MIS Quarterly 25\(1 2] Armstrong, J.S. and Overton, T.S., "Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys", Journal of Marketing Research, 14 3] Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., and Wilson, D., "Using and Validating the Strategic Alignment Model", Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13\(3 4] Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., and Mukhopadhyay, T., "Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation", Information Systems Research, 6\(1 5] Bassellier, G. and Benbasat, I., "Business Competence of Information Technology Professionals: Conceptual Development and Influence on IT-Business Partnerships MIS Quarterly, 28\(4 6] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Gomber, P., Wagner, H.-T and Weitzel, T., "Die Bedeutung des Alignments von IT und Fachressourcen in Finanzprozessen: Eine empirische Untersuchung", Wirtschaftsinformatik, 48\(5 339 7] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of outsourcing on IT business alignment and IT flexibility: a survey in the German banking industry",  Twelfth Americas Conference on Information Systems AMCIS 8] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "Strategy matters - The role of strategy type for IT business value",  12th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS 9] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The impact of operational alignment on IT flexibility Empirical evidence from a survey in the German banking industry",  13th Americas Conference on Information Systems \(AMCIS CO 10] Beimborn, D., Franke, J., Wagner, H.-T., and Weitzel T., "The Influence of Alignment on the PostImplementation Success of a Core Banking Information System: An Embedded Case Study",  40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences \(HICSS Big Island \(HI

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
