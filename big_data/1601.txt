A Semantic Bayesian Network for Web Mashup Network Construction  Chunying Zhou 1 Huajun Chen**, Zhipeng Peng 1  College of Computer Science Zhejiang University Hangzhou, China cyzhou, huajunsir}@zju.edu.cn phang.aaron@gmail.com Yuan Ni 2 Guotong Xie 2  IBM Research - China IBM Beijing, China niyuan, xieguot}@cn.ibm.com   Abstract With a mashup network in which a link indicates that two applications are mashupable, building a mashup can be simplified into network navigation. This paper presents an approach that constructs a Web mashup network by learning a 
semantic Bayesian network using a semi-supervised learning method. An RDF model is defined to describe attributes and activities of applications. To process all information sources on the Semantic Web, a semantic Bayesian network \(sBN\ is proposed where a semantic subgraph template defined using a SPARQL query is used to describe the information about the graph structure. The sBN offers more powerful abilities to process the information sources on Semantic Web, especially the graph structure. To improve the learning performance, a semi-supervised learning method that makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data is proposed. We ran the approach on a data set containing 100 applications collected from the website Programmableweb.com and 3077 links checked manually. The results show that the approach outperforms the PRL and the rule-based methods, and the semi-supervised learning method achieved big improvements in recall and 
0.5 F  compared with the direct learning method Keywords:Semantic Web, mashup network, probabilistic learning I   I NTRODUCTION  Originally used to describe the mixing together of musical tracks [1  m a s hup n o w re f e rs t o websi tes wea v in g data from different sources into a new service. Its popularity appealed companies to develop their own mashup tools, such as Yahoo!Pipe p  Cent er [3  and M a s h Maker 4    Inspired by the social network, an approach that builds a mashup network to facilitate building a mashup into network navigation was proposed by Bin, L. et. al [5  However, i t  
encounters a problem of predicting mashupable applications In this paper, we propose an approach that combines the Semantic Web [6 the sta t istic learn i ng  7  t o do t h e tas k  of predicting mashupable applications. This approach addresses three problems: 1\ to describe attributes, activities of applications precisely; 2\iven attributes and activities of applications, to predict mashupable applications; 3\ing a small amount of training data, to improve the performance In this approach, an RDF model is defined to describe attributes and activities of applications. Microformats i s  used to define semantics of data that applications consume and produce. There are three information sources on the 
Semantic Web: descriptive attributes, relationships and the semantic graph structure-based attribute that describes the existence of a subgraph with a specified structure. To predict mashupable applications, not only descriptive attributes and relationships, but also the third information source – the graph structure-based attribute affects the prediction result For example, whether there is another application B in the same category with A and has a link to C, probably affects the existence of a link between A and C. This factor is actually a graph structure-based attribute To handle all the information sources, we propose a semantic Bayesian network \(sBN\hat extends Bayesian networks w i t h  a b i l i t ies o f pr o ces s i ng relati o n s h i p s a nd 
semantic graph structure-based attributes. It consists of the qualitative and quantitative components. The qualitative component is actually a dependency graph composed of a set of attribute nodes \(node for short\pendency relationships amongst the nodes. The dependencies specify each node with a set of parent nodes. By learning from the training data, for each node, a conditional probability distribution \(CPD\ over its parent nodes is obtained. The quantitative component is the CPDs of all nodes. Given these two components, the joint probability of any combination of the values of all nodes can be computed as a product of their CPDs. Then, the obtained joint probability can be used to 
make the link prediction. A unique feature of an sBN is that not only descriptive attributes and relationships, but also the semantic graph structure-based attribute can be incorporated and processed. Particularly, a semantic subgraph template that can be defined using a SPARQL [1 er y  is propo s e d to describe a semantic graph structure-based attribute The existing mashups on the current Web are not all links between mashupable applications. It can't be the training data for learning methods. Also, it is impossible to construct links between all mashupable applications manually. To solve the performance loss caused by lacking of training data, we propose a semi-supervised learning method that makes use 
of both the labeled data and the unlabeled data Two series of experiments were set up to do performance evaluation. First series are to do comparisons between the rule-based, the probabilistic relational learning methods and the presented approach. The results show that our approach achieved the best precision, recall and 0.5 F The second series are to do the comparison between the semi-supervised learning and the direct learning methods. And the results

Ohad, G et al  esent e d an  approach of auto-completion for mashups in which ‘glue paths’ are recommended based on their similarities compared with the given applications. The approach only considered the existing mashups, users are always deprived of creativity A new idea of building a mashup network to facilitate mashup building was proposed by Bin, L et al 5 rul e based method was used to predict mashupable applications But, by studying the existing mashups carefully, we found out that the existence of a link between applications does not only depend on this factor. In addition, it’s difficult to predict mashupable applications by just using deterministic rules Link prediction is to predict the existence of a link between two entities, taking attributes of the entities and other observed links as the known information. Approaches have been proposed to predict friendships; to predict the participation of actors in events using email, telephone calls information [12, 13 p r edict i n g  se m a n t ic r e lat ionsh i ps s u c h  as ‘advisor-of’ using web page links and conten n d mining link structure of web pages [1  Pa r t i c u l arly  m a n y  contributions related to the collaboration network have been reported [16-1  app l yin g gr ap h m i n i ng w e b m i ni n g  t e xt  mining and machine learning to do the link prediction To make probabilistic models applicable on the relational model for link prediction, Lise, G. et al. [19 p r opose d a probabilistic relational model \(PRM\that extends Bayesian networks with abilities of processing links. Benjamin, T. et al proposed a relational Markov network model [2  co m p ose d  of a set of relational clique templates describing network topology-based attributes. A clique template requires the described topology to be ‘strong connected’, where every pair of nodes must be connected. And, Christoph, K. et al proposed an approach called SPARQL-ML at a d de d  data mining support to SPARQL via the PRL methods On Semantic Web, besides attributes and relationships the graph structure is also another information source. For example, whether there is another application B in the same category with A and has a link to C, also affect the existence of a link between A and C. To describe and incorporate this unprocessed information source, in our approach, a semantic subgraph template is proposed and defined to describe a graph structure-based attribute. It is able to define two types of patterns and combine them together. One type specifies the link structure of subgraphs, and the other type specifies constraints on the values of descriptive properties of the nodes. It is more complex and flexible than a graph clique III  A N RDF  M ODEL FOR W EB M ASHUP  An RDF model is defined to describe the attributes and relationships of applications. Figure 1 displays this RDF that is described in details in Table.1. An RDF graph of two applications connected by a relationship ‘mash:compatible is shown in Figure 2. This RDF is more expressive by using Microformats that can provide accurate specifications of data semantics. For example, input of ‘GoogleMap’ are defined as ‘XML:String’, and so is the output of ‘GoogleWebSearch Using Microformats, these data are separately defined as geo.longitude’ and ‘geo.latitude’, and ‘object.string’ to differentiate the semantic differences  Figure 1  An RDF model defines attributes and activities of applications TABLE I  C LASSES AND PROPERTIES OF THE RDF MODEL  RDF literals Description mash:Tile an RDF class describes applications mash:API an RDF class describes an API of an application mash:data an RDF class describes semantics of input and output data of an API mash:name describes the name of applications mash:hasTags describes tags of an application mash:hasCat defines the category of an application mash: compatible A relationship connects two mashupable applications mash: inheritance A relationship connects applications \(A, B\ that indicats A inherits from B mash:input mash:output relationships connect mash:API with mash:data mash:dataDesc describes the data semantics using the Microformats mash:dataReq defines whether one ‘mash:data’ is required or not A new relationship ‘mash:inheritance’ between instances of ‘mash:Tile’ is defined in Definition 2.1. Application A is connected to application B by this relationship if and only if all APIs of A are overrode by APIs of B. Definition 2.2 defines ‘API override’ representing that an API overrides all functionalities of another API Definition 2.1 Relationship ‘mash:inheristance G i v e n  an  application A with a set of APIs 12     n Aaa a SAA A  and B with APIs 12     n Baa a SBB B a relationship mash:inheritance’ between A and B exists if and only if for i aB BS  i aA A S that overrides i a B  Definition 2.2  API override Gi ve n a n i n s t ance 1 A of class mashup:API’ has a set of input  input A S whose values of mash:dataReq’ are ‘true’ and a set of output  output A S and another instance 1 B of ‘mashup:API’ containing a set of input parameters  input B S whose values of ‘mash:dataReq’ are ‘true and output parameters  output B S Application 1 B overrides 1 A if and only if  input A S   input B S and   output A output B SS  As shown in Figure 3, ‘GoogleWebSearch’ \(A\has one API A A PI that requires one input data and produces three

It specifies a template for probability distributions of attributes over the entire semantic graph. It consists of the qualitative and quantitative components. The qualitative component is a dependency graph G that consists of a set of nodes and dependencies amongst nodes. A dependency specifies a node with a parent node that declares that its value depends directly on values of its parent nodes. Definition 3.1 defines the dependency graph that is required to be acyclic where no node's value depends directly or indirectly on itself Definition 3.1 In an sBN a dependency graph is composed of a set of nodes attr S and a set of probabilistic dependencies amongst them S x attr A it is associated with a set of parent nodes  x P arents A through dependency relationships The quantitative component specifies a parameterization for the qualitative component, which is a set of conditional probability distributions \(CPDs\ defined in Definition 3.2 associated with the nodes of the dependency graph. For each node, a local probability distribution over all combinations of values of its parent nodes can be defined Definition 3.2 [C  S x attr A a set of parent nodes  x P arents A is assigned with it. Given a set of instantiations of the same RDF model, its CPD is defined as        CPD x x x PA PAcombParentsA  where  x comb Parents A is the set of values of its parents B  A Semantic Relation in a Semantic Bayesian Network A descriptive attribute is directly mapped to a descriptive property of the RDF, and it can be processed naturally as a usual node in a Bayesian network. But, an RDF model contains not only descriptive properties but also associated properties \(relationships\. A relationship connecting RDF classes is more complex and impossible to be processed directly in a Bayesian network like a descriptive property  In the sBN, we propose an extension to the Bayesian network to incorporate a relationship. The existence of a link is defined as a node in the dependency graph, enabling the sBN with abilities of incorporating relationships. For example, to predict whether two applications A and C are connected by a relationship R, the existence of R is defined as a node R.Exists in the dependency graph. Problems caused by the structured nature of the RDF model are solved C  A Semantic Graph Structure-based Attribute Up to now, both descriptive attributes and relationships can be incorporated in the sBN. However, there is another information source on Semantic Web that should also be incorporated. That is the semantic graph structure-based attribute that describes an attribute on the graph level. It is always a graph structure consisting of a set of descriptive properties and relationships. It cannot be processed in neither ways of processing a descriptive property nor a relationship  Figure 4  Two examples of semantic graph structure-based properties, \(a describes an attribute of ‘Type-A’ and \(b\shows an attribute of ‘Type-B The semantic graph structure-based attribute is classified into two types. One type of the semantic graph structurebased attribute is called ‘Type-A’. It describes whether values of a descriptive property of two instances are the same or not. Its value is of the type ‘Boolean’, either ‘true’ or false’. Figure 4 \(a\ describes an example of the type ‘TypeA’. This attribute describes whether values of ‘mash:hasCat of two applications are the same or not. The other type is called ‘Type-B’ that is much more complex. It involves more than two instance nodes and both descriptive properties and

relationships are probably be involved. Figure 4 \(b\ shows an example of the ‘Type-B’, having three nodes, two values of mash:hasCat’ and a relationship ‘mash:compatible’. This attribute defines that, for two applications A and C, whether there is another application B, in the same category with A and connected to C by ‘mash:compatible A semantic subgraph template is defined to describe a semantic graph structure-based attribute. It specifies a set of subgraphs that comply with predefined common patterns SPARQL is a standard RDF query language that can be used to define a semantic subgraph template by specifying what kinds of subgraphs belong to it. The definition consists of the ‘SELECT’ and ‘WHERE’ components The ‘SELECT’ statement specifies the query results. In an sBN, there is an assumption that attributes whose values can be enumerated can be processed. Thus, ‘SELECT’ needs to be converted into a logical predicate. The ‘WHERE’ is the key component of the definition. It defines query conditions that are common patterns which subgraphs of this template must comply with. Each condition is an RDF triple defined in the Definition 3.3. Definition 3.4 gives a formal definition of a semantic subgraph template Definition 3.3 An RDF triple contains three components   Subject is an URI reference or a blank node   Predicate is an URI reference that is the property connecting Subject and Object   Object is an URI reference, a literal or a blank node  Conventional written order is: Subject, Predicate and Object Further information can be found in W3C document of RDF Definition 3.4 An RDF model i R has a set of classes 12     class n Sccc in which each class i c is associated with a set of descriptive properties denoted as Pro  i c d classes may be connected by relationships denoted as R class S  Given i R a semantic subgraph template T = \(S, W where S is the ‘SELECT’ and W is the ‘WHERE’ is defined   SELECT S  12   n pp p where Pr   iclass ii cS poc returns values of the properties defined in i R   WHERE W consists of a set of RDF triples triple S  12   n tr tr tr where itriple tr S defines a condition that subgraphs must satisfy An example definition of a semantic subgraph template is shown in Figure 5. This template defines that for two applications A and C, there is another application B that is in the same category with A and is connected to C by mashup:compatible’. Detailed explanations of ‘SELECT and ‘WHERE’ components are listed as follows  SELECT’ : A variable represents the existence of application B If the result is null, its value is false  otherwise, its value is true   WHERE’ : 7 RDF triples are defined  1-3th triples: ‘?mashletA’, ‘?mashletB’, ‘?mashletC are instances of mash:Tile   4th triple: the variable ‘?cat’ represents the value of  mash:hasCat of ‘?mashletA  5th triple: ‘?mashletB’ has a value \(the variable ?cat2 of property ‘mash:hasCat  6th triple: ‘?mashletB’ is connected to ‘?mashletC’ by  mash:compatible   7th triple:?cat and ?cat2 have a same value  Figure 5  An example semantic subgraph template definition The extension of a semantic subgraph template enables an sBN with more powerful descriptiveness of attributes on the RDF graph. An sBN can process all information sources descriptive properties, relationships and the graph structure D  Learning a sBN for Link Prediction To compute the joint probability of an sBN, there is a prerequisite requiring its dependency graph to be acyclic Another assumption ‘conditional independence’ declares that a node’s value only depends on the values of its parent nodes As defined in Definition 3.5, the joint probability of an sBN is computed as a product of nodes' conditional probabilities over their parent nodes. The computation of the conditional probability of the link's existence is simplified as Lemma 3.1 Definition 3.5 Joint Probability Computation Fo r a  set of  instantiations of an RDF model I S given an sBN with a dependency graph of a set of nodes 12     attr n SAAA  where each node x A is associated with a set of parent nodes Parents  x A the joint probability of 12     n Caa a is computed as a product of nodes' conditional probabilities 12     n P aa a         i attr ii i j m AS P AaParentsA a a  where    jm aa are values of parents of i A  Lemma 3.1 [Conditional Probability Computati   The conditional probability P\(R.Exists=‘true 11  nn A aAa ted as Pr true         attr attr attr attr P R Exists true S s PS s   The conditional probability P\(R.Exists=‘false 11  nn A aAa denoted as Pr f alse        attr attr attr attr P R Exists false S s PS s    Normalization to 1  Pr true  Pr Pr Pr true true false

Beside the labeled data, it also makes use of the unlabeled data. This method is composed of a group of learning iterations. In each iteration, the training data is made up of two parts: the training data and the prediction results of its previous iteration. With iteration proceeds, the training data gets increased gradually. Then the learned sBN is used to make link prediction on the unlabeled data. We define a posterior probability over the unlabeled data in the Definition 4.1. The iteration does not end up until this probability of the iteration no longer gets better.

The rest 80 applications \(denoted as predicted S need to be added into init N  Given init N links predicted L that need to be predicted is defined in Definition 4.2. As shown in Figure 8 \(b\, the method is composed of a series of learning iterations. In each iteration, the sBN is first learned on the training data. For 1st iteration, the training data is the network init N constructed manually at the start. For other iteration, the training data is composed of: the training data and prediction results of its previous iteration For all iteration, links that need to be predicted are the same. The trained sBN is thereby applied on predicted L to predict the existence of potential links. Finally, the iteration process ends up when the posterior probability of the learning iteration no longer gets increased.

By manually verifying mashupable applications, a network of 100 nodes and 3077 links was built up. It is divided into the training and testing data Precision, recall and 0.5 F are used to evaluate its performance To evaluate the presented approach, the probabilistic relational learning \(PRL\ [19  and the ru le-b a sed m e t h o d 5   were used as the competitors. The approach was first compared with the PRL method. Different from the PRL method, besides descriptive attributes and relationships, a semantic Bayesian network is extended to enable processing the semantic graph structure-based attribute. Experiments are set up to evaluate whether the approach works better than the PRL method. Other than probabilistic learning methods, the rule-based method uses logical reasoning to predict links  The PRL method: It can process descriptive attributes and relationships using the semi-supervised learning method. Its dependency graph prl D G nly contains two nodes R.Exists and content.compatible and a dependency from R.Exists to content.compatible It is part of the sBN's dependency graph of Figure 6  The rule-based method: Specific to our mashup case one deterministic rule is defined to predict links. It is that if output that application A produces satisfies the requirements of inputs that application B consumes the link from A to B exits, otherwise does not exist To evaluate whether the semi-supervised learning method really improves the performance, comparing with the direct learning method, 20 randomly selected applications were used as the training data. The left 80 applications and links amongst them were used as the testing data. To avoid the impact of using one specific set of 20 applications, our approach and the PRL method were both executed 10 times using ten pairs of training and testing data. The mean of precision, recall and 2 F were got.

To make comparisons between our approach and other two methods, three experiment plans are defined as follows  Plan 1 Using the training data i TD training D and the testing data i Test test D an sBN whose dependency graph is shown in Figure 6 is learned on the training data and used to predict links on the testing data. The semi-supervised learning method was also used. With 10 pairs of training and testing data, the approach was executed 10 times to get mean performance  Plan 2 In a like manner, the PRL method was also executed 10 times, each of which uses i TD and i Test  with using the semi-supervised learning method. The mean performance was obtained  Plan 3 The rule-based method was executed 10 times on itest Test D to get mean performance The direct learning method is that an sBN is learned directly on the training data and used to do link prediction on the testing data. The experiment plans for the semisupervised and direct learning methods are defined  Plan 4 for the semi-supervised learning method\: The experiment plan is the same to Plan 1   Plan 5 the direct learning method\: For each pair of i TD and i Test an sBN is learned on i TD and used to do prediction on i Test directly to get mean  performance B  Results and Analysis To evaluate the performance of our approach, a series of experiments of Plan 1, Plan 2 and Plan 3 were set up and executed to evaluate precision, recall and 0.5 F of the three methods. The ‘threshold’ was assigned as {0.1, 0.2,...,1 Figure 8 shows the mean performance over 10 executions As shown in Figure 9 \(a, b\, precision of our approach got increased as ‘threshold’ increased from 0.1 to 0.9. While its recall got decreased as ‘threshold’ increased. As shown in Figure 9 \(c 0.5 F  got increased as ‘threshold’ increased from 0.1 to 0.7 and the best performance when ‘threshold 0.7, while from 0.8 to 1.0  0.5 F  got decreased. The results show that as ‘threshold’ increased from 0.1 to 0.7, the influence made by precision on 0.5 F  was bigger than that made by recall.

Precision, recall and 0.5 F of the rule-based method shown in Figure 9 never changed. The results show that our approach achieved the best precision and 0.5 F  To compare the semi-supervised and direct learning methods, Plan 4 and Plan 5 were executed. Figure 10 shows the results, in which the mean precision of the direct learning method was always higher than that of the semisupervised learning. Because training data for the direct learning is of good quality with no wrong links. The mean recall of our method was much higher than recall of the direct learning method. However, as the improvement of recall was much bigger than the decrease of precision 0.5 F  of our method was higher than that of the direct learning We chose a case that takes a certain pair of the training and testing data and ‘threshold’=0.7 as an example process of the semi-supervised learning method. Figure 11 shows variations of precision, recall and 0.5 F of iterations \(total 7 iterations\.

An sBN extends Bayesian networks to process relationships and semantic graph structure-based attributes. A semantic subgraph template is defined to describe a semantic graph structure-based attribute. And, a semi-supervised learning method is used to improve the performance. The approach was executed on a data set composed of 100 applications and 3077 links. The results demonstrate that the approach outperformed the PRL and rule-based methods. The results show that the semi-supervised learning method made big improvement in recall and 0.5 F compared with the direct learning method In the future, three directions of work need to be proceeded. One is to continuously leverage probabilistic learning on Semantic Web. More probabilistic models can be enabled working well on Semantic Web. The second one is to learn the dependency structure of a sBN instead of manually defining it. The third one is to do mashup recommendation, taking advantages of the constructed mashup network that can inspire users with creativity to build more creative and interesting mashups A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work is funded by NSFC61070156, 2009QNA5025 2010QNA5044 and the IBM-ZJU Joint research projects R EFERENCES  1  Declan, B., Mashups mix data into grobal service Nature 439, pp 6-7, 2006 2  Yahoo!

  9 4  F EATURE E XTRACTION AND T HE D IAGNOSTIC S YSTEM  Given the complexity of the experimental data and the variety of failure modes \(actuator and sensor failures\, a diagnostic system based on Artificial Neural Networks ANN\was designed. A comprehensive analysis of data was carried out to extract a set of uncorrelated features that would not only detect various fault modes but also disambiguate between sensor and system faults. Keeping the latter requirement, the confus ion matrix \(Table 9\was further partitioned into sections that helped to interpret the results. This section explains the implementation details and enumerates the key aspects of the classifier diagnostic system Feature Extraction Appropriate feature extracti on lays the foundation of a successful \(accurate and reliab le\gnostic system. For a successful practical implemen tation it is desirable that features not only be computationally inexpensive but also be explainable in physical terms. Furthermore, they should be characterized by a\be tween-class and small withinclass variance, b\ should be fairly insensitive to external variables like noise, and c\ld be uncorrelated with other features. Keeping these requirements in mind, we selected a set of seven sensor-feature pairs that were expected to detect and distinguish seven distinct modes of the system: a healthy system, two actuator fault modes, and four different sensor faults \(see Table 7\. Based on an extensive literature search \(see Section 2\sor faults were generated with parameters representative of the real world. Specifically, a bias of 20% value of peak-to-peak temperature signal magnitude, a temperature sensor drift with drift velocity of 0.02 \260F sec, a scaling factor of 1.5 times the original signal peak to-peak amplitude, and a zero output \(dead sensor\re simulated using the baseline data to include various sensor faults Table 7 - Fault vs. Feature Matrix In addition, since there were several different experimental conditions that considerably affect the sensor measurements two additional features were designed that characterize these experimental conditions. These features are described below Table 8 gives an overview of all the features and their significance with respect to different system modes they identify. Features were calculat ed every half a second on a one second long sliding wind ow. Thus for each 90 second long segment \(under various conditions\180 feature points were generated Load Profile Indicator \(LPI Experiments were conducted under two different load profiles, namely sinusoidal and triangular, to cover two extremes of smooth and drastic movements around the point of direction reversal. However in practice, it is expected that a real load profile would lie somewhere in between these two situations. Since a significant difference was observed in sensor measurements under different load profiles, a feature called Load Profile Indicator \(LPI developed to numerically represent the roughness of motion Each one second sampling window is further subdivided into smaller sub-segments of 0.002 seconds and a local slope is calculated for each sub-segment. A variance of absolute values of the slope from these segments is then computed as a feature for operational condition. Triangular profile results in a smaller \(near zero\variance, where as a pure sinusoidal profile results in a higher variance due to smooth peaks. Any combination of triangular and sinusoid segments appropriately results in a representative variance as shown in Figure 5 Sinusoidal  Profile Region Po sition Sig nal Load Profile Indicator  Figure 5 - Load Profile Indicator \(LPI Force Indicator \(FI Loads were applied under two types of forces: opposing force and spring force.  In the case of opposing force motion, a constant force is experienced by the system whereas for spring motion the force is proportional to the displacement from the neutra l position. Computing FI for opposing force is trivial; however, for spring force motion force indicators were computed by assessing the value of spring-constant k at peak position displacements and using them to calculate corresponding forces at all other positions Thus, in addition to the seven features derived from sensor Table 7\ese two condition feat ures were input as part of a nine point vector to the classi fier system \(described next Diagnostic Classifier A three layer Artificial Neural Network \(ANN\was implemented as a multi-category classifier to distinguish between the seven states of the system health.

  10 one for each feature in the in put feature vector. The hidden layer had five nodes with logsigmoid transfer function and the output layer had seven nodes with logsigmoid transfer functions, one for each of the seven classification categories. All input features were continuous, real-valued and were standardized to have zero mean and unit variance 1 B i nary t a rget s were as si gne d s u ch t h at of t h e se ve n output bits only the correct categ ory bit turned 1 and the rest stayed 0. Initial weights for th e network were chosen based on standardized input ranges to ensure uniform learning 17  Netwo r ks were train e d  u s ing th e resilien t b a ckpropagation \(RPROP\gorithm   Evaluation Procedure & Results Data were divided into two sets for training and testing purposes, based on the experiment load levels. The network was trained on low load conditions \(~900lbs\ and was tested for high load \(~1800lbs\ditions. In order to obtain a meaningful statistic, 30 ANNs were trained and tested for each experiment and the results averaged. Training was carried out for 200 epochs. Results were further aggregated in the form of a confusion matrix as shown below in Table 9 to observe the False Positive rate \(FP\False Negative rate FN\, Misclassification rate MC\d Non-Identification rate \(NI\. The rows in the co nfusion matrix represent true state of the system and the columns represent estimated states. As shown, misclassification rate is observed as a measure of disambiguation between component faults and sensor faults and as non-identification rate for cases that are not identified as any of the predefined classes. Each category is computed as a percen tage of the total number of observed instances in the respective classes  Table 9  Confusion matrix for two component faults and four sensor faults   NF CF1 CF2 SF1 SF2 SF3 SF4 NF TP FP CF1 TP  CF2  TP  MC SF1 TP    SF2  TP   SF3  TP  NI SF4 FN MC  TP   Table 8 \226Diagnostic Classifier Features  Feature Sensors Definition Fault Modes Rationale Temperature Deviation TD Nut thermocouple Motor thermocouple Absolute deviation from nominal temperature range Spall, jam sensor bias Nut temperature rises due to increased friction from spalled nut.

Dead sensor results in zero output Load Profile Indicator Position sensor Characterizes the smoothness of load profiles ranging between smooth sinusoids to rough triangular profiles All Nature of load the profile significantly changes the vibration signature of the system. This difference should be distinguished from failure signatures Force Indicator Position sensor Assesses the force on actuator For opposing force motion the force remains constant proportional to peak loads. For spring motion force varies with the position and is a fraction of the peak loads All Given combinations of two different load conditions and two load application methods, differences in corresponding sensor signatures should be distinguished from fault signatures 


  11 5  R ESULTS   D ISCUSSION  Based on the procedure described above, a total of 3.46 false positive rate, 1.21% false negative rate, and 0.29 misclassification rates were observed. About 3.8% cases were not identified under any of the defined categories Upon careful observation, it was realized that the relatively high value for non-identification rate can be attributed to several factors.  First, the experiments were conducted under multiple conditions of load levels, load types, and load profiles. Each of these conditions affects the baseline measurements in their own ways, often overlapping with the affects produced by various components and sensor faults For instance, nut temperature may be observed to increase due to ball jam, thermocouple bias, or thermocouple drift faults. However, high loads result in higher temperatures than low loads and spring motion load profile consistently results in higher temperatur es. These changes in load characteristics result in difference in baseline conditions themselves and hence, if not appropriately trained, a classifier finds it difficult to point to any specific reason for such effects. Furthermore, no information regarding ambient temperatures was available from the experimental data. It must be noted that ambient temperatures can affect the baseline measurements as well. Since we partitioned the experimental data into high and low load sets, the classifier did not get a good chance to learn the effects of the load levels and, consequently, th e ability to distinguish them from other effects that cause such overlapping variations \(it also points to a more fundamental weakness of data-driven approaches\ilar effect s are not only limited to temperature variations, but also to the vibration levels measured throug h accelerometers 6  P LANS F OR F UTURE W ORK  There are a number of differ ent avenues for future work Longer duration experiments will be conducted to better characterize the effects of exte rnal factors and obtain more consistent training and testi ng data. This will also provide steady state measurements to es tablish repeatable baselines as well as reveal dynamic effects of the seeded fault conditions. Experiments under controlled conditions will be conducted to characterize the effects of external environment, loading conditions, various fault modes, and severity of those faults. Other experiments will be conducted to develop techniques for detecting motor faults e.g. rotor shaft eccentricity and winding insulation degradation\echanical fa ults requiring high precision high resolution position sensing \(e.g. backlash\ that end plans are under way to carry out experiments on a new actuator test stand \(Figure 6\NASA Ames by seeding faults into the test actuator and the sensing system and observing their signatures while the system operates under a variety of load conditions. The new test stand incorporates a powerful electro-mechanical load actuator \(Moog 886 series\pable of generating up to five metric tons of force The flexible design of the stand accommodates test actuators of various sizes and configurations and its control system allows creation of fully customizable load and motion profiles.  The sensor suite features a load cell accelerometers, as well as high precision position, current and temperature sensors Classifiers rely on features to allow optimal detection and disambiguation between system and sensor faults. While the features described herein are focused mostly on the time domain, other categories of features \(e.g., frequency-based should be considered. As more data becomes available more sophisticated features will be explored for improving the diagnostic performance. Another direction for future work is the verification of dynamic models being developed for actuator systems. These models will then be employed in hybrid diagnostic and prognostic techniques. Sensor fault models validation and verification is yet another potential direction. Experiments with seeded sensor faults on real systems should be conducted to confirm that the models behave correctly. In practice, sensor fault detection should go hand-in-hand with accommodation strategies. The understanding of underlying mechanisms of sensor faults gained in the process will be tapped into when considering new techniques for sensor fault accommodation  Figure 6 \226 New EMA test stand at NASA Ames research center 7  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper describes efforts to identify and categorize fault modes for electro-mechanical actuators \(direct-drive ball screw type in particular\Four main classes of faults are presented: mechanical/structural, motor electrical/electronic, and sensor A subset of faults \(return channel jam, spalling, sensor bias, sensor drift, and sensor scaling\s then selected for a more detailed study and experiments on an electro-mechan ical actuator test stand The data obtained in these experiments were used for feature extraction and tests of the newly created neuralnetwork based diagnostics system.  In the process feasibility of reliably detecting this type of faults was demonstrated.  Diagnostic test results show low false positive, false negative, and misclassification rates, as well as robustness against sensor faults

the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
