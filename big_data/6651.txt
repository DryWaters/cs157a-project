Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatio-temporal datasets is more difficult than extracting the corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types and the embedded topologies, spatial and temporal relationships and spatial autocorrelation.

Abstract 
identify disease causes and correlating them to spatially explicit disease patterns and variations in health risks. The main issue in traditional mining of association rules in disease surveillance data is that a large number of rules are discovered, but most of them are of limited use in addressing the stated objectives or original questions asked. Moreover, not all of the generated rules are interesting \(due to their inability to conclusively mine spatio-temporal prevalence and causative factors of diseases\nd some rules may be ignored. These drawbacks result as these methods ignore the inherent spatiotemporal dependency in such data. This paper makes a case for the use of MiSTIC algorithm to address these issues compare the use of traditional association rule mining in 
context of Salmonellosis disease management, and share new insights. An illustrativ e case study presented here suggests that in comparison to traditional association rule mining, even simple spatio-temporal data mining approaches taking into consideration the spatio-temporal interdependencies in disease data, can provide new and valuable scientific insights towards efficient disease surveillance and management

sensing, environmental monitoring devices, location-aware services and surveys, and internet-based volunteered geographic information. Owing to these differing rates of advancements in the collection and storage of data as compared to its processing, analysis and assimilation, there is an urgent need for effective and efficient methods to extract interesting and previously unknown, but potentially useful patterns from spatial data sets of unprecedentedly large volume, high dimensionality, and varying scales and complexity.

[1,2   Data mining techniques are typically based on deriving induction-based understanding, as opposed to logic-based or theoretical deductive reasoning, since they are not used to prove or disprove pre-existing hypotheses but rather to 
identify patterns embedded within data, and thereby support hypothesis generation [4 Most r esea rch in sp ati al te m p or al   and spatio-temporal data mining has sought to adapt classicalê data mining algorithms which are intended to operate on chiefly transactional-like data. Such adoption presents a number of challenges due to the complexity of geographic domains, limited mapping into a spatial and/or temporal framework, and the autocorrelation exhibited \(in space and/or time\ by these dataset [2  A p a r t f r o m an inherent inaccurate assumption of spatially un-correlated data, these classical methodologies require a broader knowledge of the data in order to deìne the primary hypothesis of the analysis. As a consequence, the analyses

In other words, even though these methods confirm known or expected patterns, they do not necessarily help in understanding the underlying factors governing the phenomena recorded in large spatial databases in order to conclusively form more complex and perceptive rules. This is particularly critical for spatio-temporal data where spatial and temporal dependence is evident but the domain knowledge required for an explanation is inadequate, thus limiting the application and outcome. Hence, spatio-temporal characteristic-driven data mining becomes indispensable In the context of disease data, many approaches for prevalence mapping of the di sease and visual analysis of such patterns have been adopted and the use of GIS in such spatially explicit approaches is increasing. [31-33 Fu rth e r   health experts are interested in understanding the consequent risks and build forecast models, either in the short or midterm as part of the disease management strategies. Currently the latter are based on spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal co-occurrence of disease incidences, but in most of these cases the approaches consist of either a characteristic decoupling of spatial and temporal interdependencies [2530   or an in h e rent d e pen d en cy on v a ri ou s eti ol og ic al and  geographical factors. The challenge for data mining in health or any other monitoring application is the factor that needs to be monitored Ö either the outcome or the causative factors that lead to this outcome. Correlation studies primarily focus on the later class of the problems based on apriori knowledge of the processes involved, but the lack of data availability is a bottleneck. On the other hand, outcome based studies are used more for response strategies and have limited understanding of the possible interactions of a range of parameters, including spatio-temporal ones Even though many recent works like [4, 34-36 ha ve been successful in mining spatial co-location patterns, there is a marked difference in the methodology and philosophy of these approaches and the one used here. This work differs from the earlier ones in three main aspects - \(i\the pattern elements that are aimed to be found are proxies for event occurrence, while our pattern el ements that occur are the outcomes of the spatio-temporal relationships among geographic entities; \(ii\ mined patterns indicate the occurrence or otherwise of the apriori knowledge while our approach tries to represent the dynamic pattern of the spatiotemporal phenomenon; and \(iii\ temporal and time-series data mining has usually handled them as çfixed-partitions as predeìned categories and thus leading to a discretization whereas here we treat it as a space-time continuum. This discretization approach is a natu ral extension of the empirical or observational\ model of the data The existing approaches aim to capture the coherent regions or clusters across space based on their characteristic features, often accounting for temporal history at the location as a separate dimension, typically the case with many timeseries analysis based models. This leads to the approximation of real dynamic phenomena into static or semi-dynamic conditions and hence the effort is at mining/extracting these However, the proposed work aims at finding the flow-like interactions between regions based on their spatio-temporal attributes leading to the discovery of the origins \(sources\r destinations of these flows, either positive or negative. Here we are interested in the zones that encompass these flows and how these zones vary over time provides a critical insight into the dynamism of the phenomena In this work, an effort has been made to explain the use of Mining Spatio-Temporally Invariant Core regions [14  hereinafter referred as MiSTIC, as in [15   as  a  g ene ri c  approach for objective, statistically valid analyses of geographic variations in disease prevalence, with particular focus on generation of çinterestingé and relevant knowledge to the domain, and to combine the same with GIS to map the results for effective understanding. The MiSTIC algorithm depends on the observed event rather than on its causative factors to evaluate risk. As part of this work, the following spatio-temporal queries of disease spread analysis are addressed in order to find locations based on the spatiotemporal occurrence history so as to Prioritize the locations according to the history of observed parameters \(disease occurrence in this case Reduce the effect of disease and contain its spread in the regions of interest and neighborhood, and Based on their spatial neighborhood disease prevalence and spread dynamics, make informed decisions and streamline public health planning and management efforts The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The data which has been used for the comparative analysis of the two paradigms of data mining and to validate the respective techniques against hypothe ses derived from domain knowledge has been described in Section II. Sections III and IV include illustrative case studies of data mining of Salmonellosis prevalence in three states in the USA over varied time periods and demonstrate their respective executions in context of disease etiology. In particular Section III performs an analysis of the association rule mining, while Section IV does the same for spatio-temporal data mining using core detection and zone delineation.

reported annually at county level. Other details of the data are as follows TABLE I A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING  This section applies the traditional association rule mining technique on the described data, and analyzes the outcomes of the same Initially, the analysis is done with a very simplistic input consisting of consisting of only the locations of state counties under surveillance and their respective annual disease rates in the three datasets. Hence, in this case, there is only one temporally-evolving variable - the observed value disease-rates\ at different locatio ns. With this bi-variant data available, the only patterns that can be extracted are the variations of observed values with respect to the locations in space, i.e. analyzing variation of one variable in terms of other. In order to accomplish that, the çtransit approaché has been used which makes use of a moving window-based representing spatial ranges/frames\oothing of directional data to examine the non-stationary variation in distribution of disease rates across space  Fig. 1 depicts the basic variation curves of disease rates along the longitudinal and latitudinal windows. As can be seen from Fig 1\(a\, the disease rates decrease along the eastwest transect implying that the disease decreases as one goes from coast to hinterland in Florida. The latitudinal curve however, does not give us much information about the spatial evolution of the observed quantity \(disease rate\d hence, we focus on just the longitudinal variations In spite of showing an enco uraging trend of variation with the distance from the coast, quantitatively, the data was of highly intermittent nature. Hence, the Minimum support\ and Minimum Confidence\ values for mining association rules in the longitudinally-grouped data were both kept low to prevent overlooking of correlations due to strict criteria. Hence, keeping and the data was mined for relevant rules. The disease rates were converted from ordinal to nominal data by grouping the disease rate values into 3 groups Ö LOW MEDIUM and HIGH, so as to prevent the confidence values from going too low The 9 association rules that were returned were as follows a  1   1

Due to the limited amount of etiology-related information generated from the association rule mining from the elementary data about geographical disease prevalence, more data related to the environmental demographic and economic landscapes of the three locations was collected to perform a comprehensive analysis of the disease spread dynamics, and to initiate hypotheses related to non-spatial factors which might play a part in the disease etiology A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING RESULTS FOR F LORIDA  A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING RESULTS FOR C ALIFORNIA  A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING RESULTS FOR N EW Y ORK   0.2 0.9 269 1 0.15 0.9 730 3 0.1 0.9 2590 47 0.05 0.9 17155 2504 In this case, the minimum support and confidence metrics were varied in order to obtain varying degrees of association rules from the data. The aim was to obtain as many relevant associations from the process as possible. The Apriori algorithm of Association Rule Mining extracts all cooccurrences from the data that satisfy the minimum support and confidence metrics. Even though these associations based on co-occurrence patterns are statistically valid, but they do not generate any knowledge significant for the domain-oriented purpose of the association rule mining process. Hence, relevant rules in this case refers to the rules which were able to relate extr eme disease occurrence and the auxiliary factors which were hypothesized to be a factor in the disease prevalence in the region and hence, provide some direction towards its etiology 
Association Rules for New York State   1 Data pertaining to Economy \(Per capita income Poverty\; Demographics \(White Population, Black Population, Household Size, Education\ and Environmental landscapes \(Susceptible Neighbors\ was collected from various sources, primarily from the US Census Bureau [13  Since most of the data listed was numeric, a major preprocessing step included discretization of this numeric data into ordinal categories in order to make it a suitable input for the Apriori algorithm. The factors listed above were considered as part of a hypothesis in the expectation of finding correlations between the disease rates and these factors, hoping that they are outcomes of inherent spatialtemporal characteristics in the respective regions like spatial segregation by income levels. In addition to that urbanization was taken into consideration as a proxy for sanitation-related factors as an informed factor based on the disease epidemiology, explained as follows It is a foodborne illness caused by the salmonella bacteria which are contained chiefly in contaminated food or water. Most commonly people acquire Salmonella through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs like poultry \(turkeys and chickens Due to this reason, sanitation and neighborhood hygiene are the most significant means of control Association Rule Mining was carried out on the consolidated and preprocessed data and based on varying support and confidence measures, following results were obtained TABLE II In the initial analysis performed in Section III \(A\, based on the case of Florida, looking at the clear variation in the disease rates with respect to the longitudinal windows, an intuitive observation is that the longitudinal window can translate to the distance from the coast. This hypothesis is also supported by the association rules that are further mined However, this hypothesis fails when the same approach is tested on California and New York data, as can be seen from the corresponding plots in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the variations between disease rates and longitudinal distance is not definite of the hypothesis proposed from the earlier observations. Hence, even though the association rule mining of elementary spatio-temporal data does provide some leads either they are not robust enough, or they are just symptomatic and fall short of completely explaining the phenomenon to justify the ex perimental observations across different data Based on the results achieved in Section III \(B\, Tables II, III and IV, it was observed that even though the classical Apriori algorithm is able to generate a plethora of statistically valid associations from a significantly small amount of input data, these associations were only indicative at best. Even if there were a substantial amount of rules that were generated when auxiliary data was consolidated and worked upon, the scale of these associations was highly unpredictable with respect to the location being analyzed owing to the marked differences in the auxiliary factors

being hypothesized like economy, population heterogeneity etc. Based on the difference in the scales of knowledge that could be deduced from the method with and without the additional data, the method clearly is tightly coupled with domain-related information. It is suggestive but yet not conclusive. Also, owing to the embedding of spatio-temporal information within the data framework, the association rules pertaining to the desired objective tend to get dominated by the more observable ones, which in turn, more often are not the desired ones as far as the purview of the process being analyzed \(epidemiology in this case\ is concerned. Similarly in [1 Br osset te p o in te d ou t th at w h ile h i g h s u ppo rt h i g h confidence rules will be useful in the disease surveillance paradigm, high-support, low-confidence rules would often be more valuable IV S PATIO T EMPORAL D ATA M INING  In this section, the relevant parts of MiSTIC algorithm is described [15  in o r de r to  c aptu r e  th e in h er ent s p a ti o temporal interdependencies in the data and leverage the same to extract significant locations based on their spatial and temporal disease prevalence history. The method proceeds by first identifying disease core locations \(details in [14    and then demarcates the complete region into zones based on the temporal prevalence of observed values i.e., disease rates in their respective spatial locations; disease rates in its neighborhood; and neighborhood interaction with the core regions detected earlier This step involves data normalization for standardizing the disease counts; and data representation preprocessing in order to handle differences in sampling of disease and population data Using the Florida dataset, for each of the 50 years, the set of valid focal polygons were detected and corresponding zones were created and delineated. The algorithm for core detection and zone delineation can be referred from [14  T h ere are tw o t y pe s of cores Ö Cores with Continuous Neighborhood \(CC\d Cores with a Defined Radius \(CR\After classifying the focal polygons as CC and CR, based on their frequency of disease occurrence, they were sub-classified as Ö CHD Core with Less Dominating focal Core with Negligibly low Dominating focal polygon\hese subclasses represent high disease prevalence, moderate to low prevalence and random occu rrences of the disease respectively. As noted in the original algorithm based on Monsoonal Data, the frequent/predominantly occurring focal points capture the localized behavior of the disease occurrence whereas the neighborhood constraints capture the nature \(dynamic/non-dynamic\ the event.

C OMPARISONS AND D ISCUSSION  The earlier sections III and IV report the outcome of the application of the traditional Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining, and the MiSTIC spatio-temporal data mining technique to Salmonellosis disease occurrence data respectively. As can be seen from the performance of Apriori in mining çinterestingé and çusefulé rules which were valuable to the domain-driven task, it required huge amounts of auxiliary and derived spatial \(relationship\ data Whereas, the spatio-temporal mining process was able to provide a clear demarcation of locations in the state that were critical to the disease occurrence without the need to acquire and preprocess huge auxiliary data As also noted by Mennis and Liu in [5   a m ajor issu e  with traditional association rule mining is the fact that it is highly domain-knowledge dependent. This deduction stems from a variety of causes. One of them being that it is designed to work with categorical data, not numeric data such as density of population, or per-capita income. One popular approach to this problem is to discretize numeric data into ordinal categories and then mine those ordinal data for association rules. For example, in this case, \(Section III B\a such as disease rates was reconstructed into categories of low, medium, and high. Such a conversion is contingent on the expert know ledge including the levels of discretization Ö fine or coarse. This discretization can lead to either too much redundancies, in terms of rules extracted, or miss out on the important ones. Such concerns make the choice of the appropriate methods, though many exist, highly subjective. In addition, in many a case the prevalent underlying spatio-temporal patterns are difficult to detect as these associations are not encoded explicitly in the database and only the association between these transactions can be discernible. Even though a number of approaches have been developed to address this issue, the task of development of a generic algorithm that seamlessly handles the spatiotemporal interactions across differe nt domains still remains a challenge [5   Though the application of Association Rule mining gave some leads, the Causality-based inferences are hard to make in this case, since it requires a lot of expert control over the data mining parameters. In spite of that, the results presented are not conclusive in nature. On the other hand, when spatiotemporal topologies, relationships and prevalence history were extracted from the data, there was no need to specify or derive any parameters that would require or be best guessed

While, in case of California, being a highly industrialized state undergoing rapid urban expansion and population growth, 9 out of the 16 cores detected were on the urban-rural fringes or peri-urban areas. On the other hand, a staggering 18 out of 21 cores in New York state were either in the rural \(12\ or urban-rural fringe \(6\zone. These results give a strong indication towards the fact that urbanization-related factors are a major reason for the occurrence and prevalence of Salmonellosis in the area of study. These validate the domain-based epidemiological reasoning of spatio-temporal prevalence of the said disease Thus, in addition to fulfilling the basic need of an epidemiological application of finding disease çhot-spots the MiSTIC method also provides valuable insight into the understanding of the disease prevalence in different regions based on their temporal history of occurrences and their spatial extent V

through expert intervention. Instead, the method itself was autonomous enough to provide an output which was of value to the process of data mining, and could be used readily for further enquiry The method based on spatio-temporal characteristics is more principle-based, and hence, does not rely on a domaindependent hit-and-trial methodology to either categorize data, nor is conditional to differences in domains and data. It is more independent and insensitive towards imbalances in the data and therefore, is able to provide a handle on the process of spatio-temporal data mining, leading to significant insights towards the etiology of the disease. In addition, if the relative risk of a location towards the disease can be known, epidemiologists and public health professionals can make informed and much aware decisions based on the available resources and the intensity of risk in order to direct disease prevention and control programs; thus, making a valuable addition to disease management. Whereas in the case of traditional mining the process and the results are conditioned by the knowledge base of the operator, due to which, it becomes hard to put these techniques to generic use like answering the queries on prioritization of locations for effective disease management VI C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, the utility of MiSTIC - a generic method of mining critical location or cores based on their spatiotemporal occurrence of the observed variable \(disease count is demonstrated, which is negligibly dependent on background knowledge from the domain. This is particularly critical for complex domains like disease spread analysis where there are many instances where the etiology of elements \(disease\ is poorly understood. Such a methodology adds rich value to the process of spatio-temporal mining since apart from fulfilling the issues raised in Section 1, it also provides valuable insight into the etiology of disease hence helping in better disease detection, surveillance, and management. The proposed method, as compared to traditional data mining algorithms, takes much lesser domain-dependent input and provides an output which is qualitatively better and relevant to the domain The method is based on typical spatio-temporal characteristics intrinsically present in the data, however huge, describing its own dynamic variability, in order to quantify and capture the otherwise indiscernible patterns in it. While, classic methodologies involve analyzing such kind of data as a sum of semi-parametric spatial and temporal trends [26  div i din g  th e ran dom co m pon ent  in t o  tempo ra l  chunks, and analyzing the spatial patterns for each snapshot Such methodologies have a major drawback that they are able to reflect the trends only at the level of the snapshot time unit\ but are unable to capture the dynamic characteristics of the event \(her e, disease occurrence\tself Analysis of temporal variations of all the spatial patterns in one go still remains a challenge since the temporal correlation of spatial co-occurrence patterns tends to get ignored. A similar condition arose in the illustrated case in this paper, when in spite of so many factors being considered, there was not much domain-relevant outcome from the Apriori algorithm and hence inconclusive Hence, this work fosters the need for development of generic models of spatio-temporal data mining and pattern discovery which are domain in dependent and leverage the intrinsic correlations that characterize spatio-temporal data in order to mine these data and work seamlessly across different domains, effectively incorporating the spatiotemporal interdependency without losing the patterns that manifest themselves due to these interdependencies in the first place VII R EFERENCES  1

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
