The STI buffer is accumulated when the location number of the object is updated. Similarly, state buffer in STI is accumulated when pose of the object is renewed, and the posed continuance time is also recorded in the buffer. The behavior of pedestrian is basically decided by referring the location and state buffer information in the STI \(to be described in section 4 D. Multiple objects interaction It is thought that there are some interactions if the object is mutually adjacent. This information is defmed as an objects interaction map, in our algorithms. If each object is adjacent in a constant distance, the value in the object interaction map is assumed to be }, otherwise the value is assumed to be O. The information is maintained as a multiple objects interaction map as far back as m frame in the past \(see figure 5 behavior understanding on multiple pedestrians becomes possible by considering the multiple objects interaction map with STI together \(to be described in section 4 IV. HUMAN BEHA VIOR UNDERSTANDING BY THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK Basically, most of the behavior can be judged from the features by framework mentioned in the previous section Details of the major behavior understanding in this paper are shown according to the types as follows 3035 t=n t=n   t=n-m I n-2 I 1 1 2 3 0 0 96 1 2 1

Single pedestrian or no interaction 96 -=r Whether the pedestrian is crawling or lying down can be judged by referring to pose feature in the framework. However a behavior of the pedestrian can not be completely decided to be normal or abnormal by this feature. For instance, even when a pose of the pedestrian is "crawling", a behavior of the pedestrian may be judged as "normal" if the pedestrian is located on "bench". On the other hand, the behavior may be judged as 'abnormal" if the pedestrian is located on "floor The behavior understanding method of the single pedestrian judged by combining the pose feature with the location feature is described as follows 1 Figure 6\(b by our framework. When a certain pedestrian is posture of crawling" or "lying down", if the pedestrian is passing over the position where the location is a gate of tickets of the station it is obviously thought as illegal gating. Moreover, the case where the pedestrian similarly passes over the position where the location is a fence of the station is probably illegal gating 


by over fencing. In the example, it is determined that an object A is passing gate of the station, because the attribute is Pedestrian" and the location is transited from "floor" to "gate In addition, the behavior of the object A is judged to abnormal illegal gating is passing the gate 2 The object is considered as loitering if the object's attribution is "pedestrian", and the object returned to the location witch num of location is the same, and if the duration until returning is more than TL as shown in fig. 6\(c behavior of the object B seems to be normal wrongly if it is only considered that he keeps moving the position where the location is floor. This case is an example for successful understanding of abnormal behavior of the single pedestrian by time sequential transition of the location 3 The object can be understood as "crawling" or "lying down" by the pose feature, regardless of state transition of location feature. However, if the location is a bench, the behavior of the object is assumed to be normal even when the pose is "crawling". In this way, the normal behavior can be understood correctly by the combination of pose feature with 1\(wl 6\(le 10\(11 Obj A Attribute Ped Ped F\(II ft II   OBJA 7\(ob le 9\(g 11\(11 12\(11 OBJ B wlWall flFloor feFence ob Obstacle gtGate a 13\(ft

This is one of the examples using multiple object interaction. The object is considered to be abandoned, if the attribute of the object is not pedestrian, and when it is left during To. When it turns out that a pedestrian was adjacent to the object by the object interaction map, the pedestrian is considered as an owner of the object 2 3036 If there is contact with other pedestrians at the time within T D former second when a certain pedestrian is lying down on the floor and it crowds, the contact pedestrian could be suspicious.

EXPERIMENT In our experiments, the video sequences imitated by the extra's acting in various scenes such as station gate of tickets or the station premise, or the station home as shown in Table 1 They were combined to produce objects tracked frames from which the features are extracted. Then, the proposed framework algorithms developed in this work are applied for behavior understanding process. In the framework, location information on each scene is defined beforehand. The value of THs and THL deciding pose feature is set to 0.6 and 1.5 respectively The duration values deciding interaction among objects such as To or T D are uniformly configured to 50 frames. These processes were handled in off-line. The rate is 10 frames per second. The number of samples is twelve \(five categories represented in table B. Results Results of the experiments are shown in figure 8.The good performance of classification rate is proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It was confirmed that detection of the behaviors that had been targeted in this research had succeeded Additionally, there are no false detections that the behavior of pedestrians other than the target is understood as abnormal VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, the framework of the human behavior understanding corresponding to various scenes in the station is constructed. We have presented a simple rule based approach for understanding human behaviors in video sequences addressing the main goal of surveillance systems for protecting public transportation assets. The promising results indicate that there is much to be said in favor of simple methods even when the problem is complex. So, in our future works, the simple approach would be integrated with other methods such as silhouette analysis or detailed trajectory analysis \(velocity of objects etc ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was partially supported by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology NICT REFERENCES I] Teddy Ko, "A survey on behavior analysis in video surveillance for
