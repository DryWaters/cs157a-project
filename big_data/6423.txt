Study of Alarm Association Rules Mining Based on Matrix Mapping  Chen Chao Department of Communication Engineering Chengdu University of Information Technology Chengdu, China Sunny60138800@yahoo.com.cn  Li  Tong-yan   Department of Communication Engineering Chengdu University of Information Technology Chengdu, China    Abstract the efficiency of the mining algorithms plays an important role in tackling with large datasets. Classical algorithms need to scan database many times likes Apriori, for it is difficult to mine important rules in telecommunication networks. This paper proposes a matrix mapping based association rules mining method MM-ARM. Compared with 
Apriori algorithm, MM-ARM needs to visit database only once By scanning the database and applying a matrix mapping technique at the same time, the algorithm converts the alarm database into matrix, and save them in FP-tree structure in order to avoid scanning database repeatedly. The performance testing of the algorithm indicates that MM-ARM has higher temporal efficiency, which is suitable for mining association rules in telecommunication networks Keywords-Association rules mining; Matrix mapping; MMARM; Compressed matrix structure I   I NTRODUCTION  Association rules mining plays an important role in data mining, which is adapt to the telecommunication alarm correlation analysis h en a n e t w or k problem or f a il u r e  
occurs, it is possible that a very large number of alarm messages are generated; mining association rules can find the correlation of alarms and locate the source of fault effectively Therefore, how to improve the efficiency and dependability of mining methods is exigent in current research Efficient mining of frequent itemsets is a fundamental problem for mining association rules. Lots of Apriori-like algorithms [2ed to ach i ev e g ood eff i cie n c y  However, it is costly to scan the database repeatedly and handle a large number of candidate sets. As the amount of data increases, how to find an efficient mining algorithm become increasingly important and urgent In this paper, we introduce a novel Matrix Mapping based Association Rules Mining method \(MM-ARM\ to improve the performance of the mining. Our proposed algorithm first maps 
the alarm transactions into a binary matrix, and then it stores the binary matrix in the memory. In this case, it can avoid rescanning the database many times and generating a large number of candidates. Comparing with some existing mining algorithms, we offer experiment to show that our approach is more efficient The paper is organized as follows. After introducing the definitions of the mining problem in section II, we introduce how to construct a Matrix and propose our algorithm MMARM in section III. In section IV, we explain experimental results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Sect V II  D EFINITIONS  Let 12     m I ii i  be a set of items in the alarm transaction database 12     n 
D tt t    1 2  j ij n  is an item which is made of the useful alarm attributes by pretreatment. A transaction is a set of weighted items, where the weights are made from the neural network method Let 1  j n  denotes the count of the transaction of X in D  when tD  I t  The support of I describes as   s upport I  _  Support I Support Count I T  where T 
is the count of transaction in D Association is described as 12  rI I where itemsets 12  I II  and 12 II   The confidence of an association rule r shows the conditional probability that a transaction contains 2 I given that it contains 1 I   confidence r    tDI t   tD 
 The support of an association rule r is defined as  _  Support X Support Count X T  The dataset X is defined as a frequent set when   Support X minsup    minsup is the minimum support Let M inconf and minsup be the thresholds of confidence and support specified by the user respectively. Association rules mining is to find all the rules whose confidences and supports are greater than or equal to M inconf and minsup in the dataset. The association rules mining can be broken down to following two sub-problems 1\inding all the frequent itemsets whose supports are 
no less than minsup  2\erating the association rules derived from the frequent itemsets and inspecting their confidences. If the confidence is not less than M inconf the corresponding rule is an association rule described as 21221 I III I   Of above two steps, the efficiency of association rules mining mainly depends on the first step. After the largest frequent itemsets have been produced, the relevant association rules can be gained immediately  2861 978-1-4577-0321-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


III  MM-ARM ALGORITHM PROPOSED  A  Matrix construction In alarm association rules mining, the number of alarm transactions is quite large. If transaction database has M  transactions, let 12 N-1     I ii i  be the alarm itemsets, which includes N items. Then the transactions can be mapped as a matrix    I MN after scanning the transaction database This Matrix is an object-by-variable compressed structure which represents the transaction database as a binary matrix where the rows represent transactions and the columns represent alarms. Each entry  1 2  1 2  iMjN I ij  of it is stored in one bit. Alarm j is set to 1 if it exists in transaction j, and it will be set to 0 otherwise. This means the numbers of '1' per column equals to the support count of corresponding alarm. The matrix can be constructed with scanning every partition database only once In the matrix    I MN  1 2  iM I ij  1 2  j N   uses at least one byte, for I ij is a Boolean with the value 0 or 1. Considering the correlation between alarm transactions, 8 consecutive items can be compressed into one bit and described with an unsigned char variable. Here    I MN can be compressed as a matrix    CP Q in which QN   8 PM  mod80 M    8 1 PM  mod80 M   In the constructed matrix, the numbers of '1' per column equals to the support count of corresponding alarm. When frequent 1-itemsets are generated, we can easily obtain all their support counts by accessing their meta-vector. However if the size of itemset is lager than 1, it becomes more complex As every 2- itemsets is generated of two 1-itemsets by using Apriori_gen function i n e t h e col u m n o f th e  Matrix    CP Q as the element vector of each 1-itemset. If the element vectors of a k-itemsets and its 1-subitems are described as V and  11  vv v ii ik respectively, then we have 11    V vv v ii ik Therefore, we just find support counts of this k-itemsets by counting the ‘1’of V  which will save a lot of memory B  An example Take a transaction database for example to construct compressed Matrix. Transaction database is shown as TABLE 1              TABLE I  TRANSACTION DATABASE   TID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Itemsets 2 I 1 I 3 I 5 I 4 I 2 I 2 I 3 I 2 I 1 I 4 I 1 I 3 I 4 I 2 I 3 I 1 I 3 I 2 I 1 I 3 I 5 I 2 I 1 I 3 I As the method refered above, we easily get a Matrix    C 9 5 of the transaction database D. Then we can obtain the support count of 1 I by accumulating the numbers of '1' in the first column while others in corresponding columns. After that we may obtain the support count of any itemsets by joining its two subsets’ meta-vector together. Take 12 I for example, it was generated by 1 I and 2 I as follows 1110 0 01010 01101 11010 9  1 0 1 0 0 01110 10100 111 C                                 01 1110 0       12 1 2 111 010 010 111 100 010 100 111 111 VVV                     Then counting the numbers of '1' in 12 V and finally get the support of 12 I is 4. It can be seen that using compressed Matrix to calculate itemset’s support count is convenient and efficient  2862

 Figure 3  Memory Occupied changes with the number of transactions Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the performances of the MMARM and other algorithms in time executed and the main memory occupied. The minimum support is fixed up to 0.25 From the Figure 1 we can see that, although running time with two algorithms increase with the number of transactions linearly, MM-ARM increases more slowly than Apriori, and it has better time efficiency than Apriori Figure 3 shows the results of the memory usage with varying number of transactions form 20,000 to 100,000. We note that as transactions increase, memory usage by FPgrowth increases dramatically. The figure indicates that more memory space is saved with MM-ARM by the matrix mapping technique V  S UMMARIES  In this paper, we proposed a novel association rules mining algorithm called MM-ARM. This method uses the compressed matrix structure to avoid rescanning the original database. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MM-ARM has better performance than the other classical algorithms. In other word, MM-ARM has less running time and higher efficiency in comparison with other algorithms R EFERENCES  1  TongYan Li, XingMing Li.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

SMS = yes a technique while job=farmer, family communication channels middle, family communication cost = middle and family income =middle. The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers job, age and family income. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, this technique costs much c 


while age=young, education=high, family communication cost=middle and family income=high. The association rules reflect strong relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
