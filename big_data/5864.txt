The Research of Web Users\222 Behavior Mining Based on Association Rules  Xiaohong Shan The College of Economics and Management Beijing University of Technology Beijing, China Huamei Sun School of Management Harbin University of Technology Harbin, China   Abstract 227When accessing websites, users usually leave a lot of access information, which can be mined reasonably to help the managers of website to get accessing patterns of users. This article first introduces the preprocessing procedure of web logs which includes the tasks of data cleaning, Data Discretization and 
their implementation. On the basis of preprocessing the analysis method of requested resource \223URL\224 and \223referrer\224 which is the webpage before users browse the URL in web log by the use of association rules is proposed to find the accessing patterns of users. Finally the experiment is accomplished. The result shows that the method is feasible, and it can help the manager in making decisions about the analysis of website users\222 behavior and the optimization of website Keywords- Association Rules; Web Log; Web mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Web using schema mining is one of the research directions in web usage mining. By collecting the web logs 
data when users interact with the website, the massive data about users\222 behavior can be mined to get the knowledge of users\222 accessing behavior and access patterns, thus to improve the website structure and help enterprises in making business decisions. So using web logs data that reflects the detail information of users\222 access behavior from all aspects effectively has important significance for enterprises in providing intelligent information services to users In the research of web usage mining, the methods, such as statistics, cluster analysis 1 association rules 2-3 and genetic algorithm 4 were often used to analyze the web logs data and 
obtain knowledge of users\222 accessing behavior. A lot of research focused on doing cluster analysis and association analysis about users\222 browsing behavior using customer IP, the resource, and the remotehost and so on. The association analysis of the requested resource \223URL\224 and \223referrer\224 which is the webpage before users browse the URL is relatively less while their relationship can help us to analyze the jump principle among webpages in this website and that between different wetsites, thus provide the important basis for website optimization. So this article aims to find the potential relationship between the webpages that users browse using association rules II 
 R ELATED WORK ABOUT ASSOCIATION RULES  To find the association rules in transaction database was first proposed by Agrawal. R 5 its formal description is as follows Let I= {i 1 i 2 i 3 205,i m be a set of m different items, the element of which is called item Let D be a set of transactions where each transaction T is an itemset that T 
002 I. Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier, called its TID A set of items X 003 I is called an itemset We say that a transaction T contains an itemset X, if X 
002 T. An association rule is an implication of the form X=>Y, where X 002 I, Y 002 I, and X Y 004 The rule X=>Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. The rule X=>Y has support s in the transaction set D if s% of transactions in D contains XUY The classical algorithm of association rules is Apriori algorithm proposed by Agrawal.R in 1993, which is used to analyze the supermarket basket data, where rules like \22334% of all customers who buy fish also buy white wine\224 may be found The guiding idea of Apriori is to mine frequent itemsets by use of iterative method of level sequential search. Each iteration 
consists of a two phase process. One is to generate candidate set C k that tend to bring frequent itemset. The other is to compute support and decide the frequent itemset L k based on candidate set C k Apriori has been improved in different degree in Literatures [6-8 f o r  e x a m p l e   6 e x t r ac t e d f r eq ue nt i t e m se t  from candidate itemset; [7 u s ed v e ct or  o p e r a t i o n t o im plem en t  the count of frequent itemset; [8 p r o pos ed th e alg or ith m th at  integrated top-down and bottom-up search strategy to reduce the number of candidate sets III  T HE RESEARCH OF 
W EB USERS 222 ACCESSING BEHAVIOR  Like most web log mining, web users\222 accessing behavior mining is also divided into three stages, that is, data collection data preprocessing, web accessing behavior knowledge mining and analysis A  Data collection In the stage of data collection the web log files are collected at the server side, client side, and proxy servers This article research work obtained the State Natural Sciences Foundation project subsidization 70971032  7415 978-1-4577-0536-6/11/$26.00 \2512011 IEEE 


B  Data preprocessing First the webpages that have no correlation with web users\222 accessing behavior are filtered out, such as pictures multimedia, getway, Flash. The concrete method is: delete from Weblog where url like '%.gif%' or URL like '%.jpg%' or URL like '%.ico%' or URL like '%.bmp%' or URL like cgi%' or URL like '%.css%' or URL like '%g.swf Then the activities of \223HEAD\224 and \223POST\224 are filtered out, only the activity of \223GET\224 is preserved. The concrete method is: delete from Weblog where Method =\221POST\222 or Method =\221HEAD\222 The third, the failure status of request are filtered out. The concrete method is: delete from Weblog where status like '3 or status like '4%' or status like '5 Finally, requested resource \223URL\224 and \223referrer\224 which is the webpage before users browse the URL are discretized There exists hierarchical relation in website structure, for example, http://www.smsync.com/order/?ref=030 and http://www.smsync.com /order/?ref=003 are both belong to the category of http://www.smsync.com/order/. This hierarchical relation can help us find more meaningful association rules. So in data preprocessing the discretization of requested resource \223URL\224 according to sitemap is necessary which can derive a new column \223URL-Type\224. Similarly the discretization of \223referrer\224 according to the website that web users come from can derive another new column \223ReferredType\224 C  web accessing behavior knowledge mining and analysis The web accessing behavior knowledge mining based on association rule is to find the rules like \223Referred-Type=>URLType\224 in web log database that satisfies the minimum support and minimum confidence set in advance. Here we adopt Apriori algorithm. In order to find the web users accessing pattern more clearly, we divide the analysis into two parts, that is Referred-Type that its URL and referrer belongs to the same website, and Referred-Type that its URL and referrer do not belong to the same website. We call them inside Referred-Type and outside Referred-Type respectively. Thus the association rule of \223inside Referred-Type=>URL-Type\224 can help us to find the webpage\222 jump principle when users browse our website and the result can be the basis for website optimization. While the association rule of \223outside Referred-Type=>URL-Type\224 can help us to find from which website that the users come to our website, and then take measures to increase the probability that our website can be retrieved or accessed in those websites IV  E XPERIMENT  The experiment uses the sample data of WebLog Expert Lite 9 Which is the web log file of the website of 223www.smsync.com\224 from the interval of 2007.12.8.00:00:41 to 2007.12.14.23:59:56, which has 30474 web log records A  Data preprocessing First, after filtering out the invalid URL according to the previous three steps in Section 3.2 there are 6351 records left  Then according to the sitemap of \223www.smsync.com\224 shown is Figure 1, we discretize the URL in web log files to derive a new column \223URL-Type\224. The results are shown in Table I        Figure 1  the sitemap of www.smsync.com  TABLE I  M APPING BETWEEN URL-T YPE AND URL  Finally to discretize Referred-URL according to the website that users come from, Where Referred-Type starts with \2231\224 when users come from the website of \223www.smsync.com\224, and 2232\224 when users come from other websites or searching engine Part of the mapping between Referred-URL and Referred-Type are shown in Table II TABLE II  M APPING BETWEEN R EFERRED 226URL AND R EFERRED T YPE   URL-Type URL  1 www.smartsync.com 2 www.smartsync.com/Contacts 3 www.smartsync.com Downloads 4 www.smartsync.com Order 5 www.smartsync.com Partner Programs 6 www.smartsync.com SmartSync Pro 7 www.smartsync.com Support 0 others Referred-Type Referred URL 10001  www.smartsync.com 10002 www.smartsync.com/Contacts 10003 www.smartsync.com/Downloads 10004 www.smartsync.com/Order 10005 www.smartsync.com/Partner Programs 10006 www.smartsync.com/SmartSync Pro 10007  www.smartsync.com Support  20036 http://%google 20073 http://%01net.com  20122 http://www.listsoft.ru 205\205 \205\205 www.smartsync.com  SmartSync Pro Downloads Order Support Partner Programs Contacts 7416 


B  The establishment of Web users\222 accessing behavior model Using the data mining software Spss Clementine 12.0, we establish the Apriori association rule models of \223jump between webpages in the website of www.smsync.com\224 and \223jump between webpages from other websites to the website of www.smsync.com\224 respectively shown in Figure 2  Figure 2  model construction Suppose minimum support is 5%, minimum confidence is 70%. We get three strong association rules from \223jump between webpages in the website of www.smsync.com\224 model and 2 strong association rules from \223jump between webpages from other websites to the website of www.smsync.com\224 model. The results are shown in Figure 3 and 4 respectively  Figure 3  association rules of jump between webpages in the website of www.smsync.com  Figure 4  association rules of jump between webpages from other websites to the website of www.smsync.com 1\The analysis of jump between webpages in the website of www.smsync.com From the three association rules in Figure 2, the users of www.smsync.com usually jump between webpages of the same category, while the case of the jump from the subordinate webpage to the homepage of the website or the contrary is very scarce. Furthermore, the webpages under the three categories of smarsyncpro, support and downloads are paid more attention by users. So in designing the website the link between the webpages of these categories should be considered to make the users visit the website effectively 2\The analysis of jump between webpages from other websites to the website of www.smsync.com From the two association rules in Figure 3, we can see that the users jump from other websites to the website of 223www.smsync.com\224 can be divided into two groups. One group is the users entering the homepage of 223www.smsync.com\224 by the searching engine \223Google\224, the other group is the users that want to download some software who often search some software in \223http://www.01net.com\224 and then directly jump to the webpages of \223download\224 of 223www.smsync.com\224 These behavior patterns can be used to service spread of the website. First, the operation target of promoting the reputation of the website and attracting more new users can be obtained by the methods such as improving the Google Search Rank or occupying the Google advertisement place. Secondly, for popularizing the new software we can effectively use the website of \223http://www.01net.com\224. From the jumps after users search the resources in \223http://www.01net.com\224 we can see that users trust the resources of \223http://www.01net.com\224. So it is feasible to popularize the future software in this website V  C ONCLUSIONS  The relationship of the requested resource URL and referrer which is the webpage before users browse the URL in web log files reflects some accessing pattern when users accessing website. Based on the association rule mining, this article proposes the data preprocessing method of web log files, and the web users\222 accessing behavior analysis method. The method can not only find the web users\222 behavior pattern and interests, but also help the managers of the website to improve the website structure and optimize the website construction R EFERENCES   1  Ya-Xiu Yu, Xin-Wei Wang.

in the path up to that node. New transactions are added at the root level. The following is the sample database used in CATS tree TABLE I.  SAMPLE DATASET          Initially, INC-Tree is empty. Transaction 1 \(F, A, C, D, G I, M, P items, so they added at the end of the sort list in the order of sequence original transaction. Transaction 2 is added to INCTree after item C as another branch. The frequency count of every item is updated along with the increment of count field of each node of the transaction in tree. This process will be repeated for remaining transactions. After constructing INC Tree nodes representing the same item are linked and the same item in sort-list points to the first node in the tree                  The overall method for INC-Tree construction is 1. Get the transaction 


2. Build sort-list as new item found in the transaction 3. Sort original transaction according to order of sort-list 4. Add the sorted transaction to INC-Tree 5. Increment count value of each node 6. Get next transaction TID Original Transaction Sorted Transaction 1 F,A,C,D,G,L,M,P F,A,C,D,G,I,M,P 2 A,B,C,F,L,M,O F,A,C,M,B,L,O 3 B,F,H,J,O F,B,O,H,J 4 B,C,K,S,P C,P,B,K,S 5 A,F,C,E,L,P,M,N F,A,C,M,P,L,E,N  Figure 1. INC-Tree for sample data 80  7. Repeat step 1 to 6 until no transaction found in database 8. Point each item in sort-list to corresponding node that appear first in the tree and link the nodes of same item all through the tree Association rule mining is a two step process [7 Frequent itemsets generation i.e. all the itemsets having support greater than the user specified minimum support Frequent itemsets generated in the step 1 will be used to generate association rules that satisfy user specified minimum support Since association rules are generated directly from frequent itemsets, each rule automatically satisfies minimum support After constructing INC-Tree, it can be used for mining frequent patterns with different minimum support values. First discard all the items from INC-Tree which are not satisfying user given minimum support.  The sort-list is updated by removing all infrequent items one after another and at the same time the tree is pruned by deleting all nodes representing that item. Pruned INC-Tree is shown in Fig. 2    


     IV. TREE-BASED INCREMENTAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING \(TIARM Once INC-Tree is built, new transaction can be added to and deleted from INC-Tree and frequent patterns can be mined with different support values without rebuild the tree. TIARM follows divide and conquer method to generate frequent patterns without generating candidate itemsets as in FP-growth Steps of TIARM algorithm are TIARM \(INC-Tree, min_supp If INC-Tree contains a single path P, then For each combination \(denoted as b path P, then Generate pattern b + a with support = min_supp of nodes in b Else for each a in the header of tree, do  Generate pattern b = a + a with support = a.support Construct 1 2 If Treeb is not empty, then Call TIARM\(INC-Tree, b V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS All the experiments were conducted on 3.0 GHz Pentium IV \(Core to Dual professional operating system configured with 2GB main memory and 300 GB SATA 7200 rpm disk. Each experiment is performed various times and best of them is taken. The algorithm was coded in python2.6. To investigate performance we have used soybean dataset A. Dataset Description Number of instances of Soybean dataset are 683. There are 19 classes, only the first 15 of which have been used in prior work. The folklore seems to be that the last four classes are unjustified by the data since they have so few examples. There are 36 categorical attributes, some nominal and some ordered The value "dna'' means does not apply. The values for 


attributes are encoded numerically, with the first value encoded as "0,'' the second as "1,'' and so forth. An unknown value is encoded as "?''. It consists of 683 records and its source is agridataset.jar [8]. Here the task is to diagnosis soybean disease Attributes are Date, Plant-stand, Precip, Temp, Hail, Crophist, Area-damage, Severity, Seed-tmt, Germination, Plantgrowth, Leafspots-halo, Leafspot-marg, Leafspot-size, Leafshread, Leaf-malf, Leaf-mild, Stem, Lodging, Stem-cankers Canker-lesion, Fruiting-bodies, External-decay, Mycelium, Intdiscolor, Sclerotia, Fruit-pods, Fruit-spots, Seed, Mold-growth Seed-discolor, Seed-size, Shriveling, roots, class B. Performance Comparison In order to verify the performance of TIARM algorithm, we compare it with FELINE and FP-growth              Figure 3.  Scalability of TIARM with respect to number of transactions 81             


          Three algorithms are developed in programming language python 2.6. Each experiment is performed various times and best of them is taken. Figure 3 shows the performance of FPgrowth, CATS and TIARM. From the figure 3 it is observed that as the number of transactions increases with the minimum support of 2, the time taken by TIARM also increases TIARM has best performance than CATS and FP- growth. It is observed that as the size of the database increases the performance of the TIARM algorithm decreases dramatically The performance of algorithm depends only on the size of database but not support factor VI. CONCLUSION We have presented and evaluated algorithm TIARM for mining  frequent  item sets  from incremental databases.   Like         FP-tree, INC-Tree contains only frequent items. Once INCTree is built, it allows the user to mine database with different support values using only one database scan.  The experimental results show that this new algorithm works much faster than FELINE and FP-growth REFERENCES 1] R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. Swami.

ficiently solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem for indoor environments, and to reconstruct a 3D representation of the environment. The accompanying video illustrates the incremental generation of a 2D map and the estimation of the robot trajectory alongside the laser range data projected on omnidirectional images. It also shows the vertical lines detected in the images and their mapping into a 3D reconstruction of the environment In order to show the robustness of the methodology, we tested the algorithm with a sequence taken in a different indoor environment with our old robot Anis which is equipped with the same catadioptric camera and an AccuRange 4000 2D laser range finder. This laser is composed of a laser telemeter with a rotating mirror that allows measurements of points on 360?, except for an occlusion cone of approximately 30? caused by the assembly of the mirror. The resulting 2D map is shown in Figure 9. The vertical line extraction and the reconstruction of the 3D environment were 3523 Fig. 9. Global Map obtained by SLAM in Borel Building consistent as well The SLAM problem has been solved using many different approaches, however some important problems need to be addressed that are often directly linked to the sensors used Laser range finders cannot help in evaluating the translation of a robot moving in a straight line in a corridor. Mapping in dynamic environments is also hard with only laser data. On the other hand, using visual sensors alone introduces issues such as propagating correctly the scale factor, initializing the range when using a monocular sensor, and merging data when using multiples cameras In our approach, the laser provides metric information of the environment that helps to fix a scale factor \(removing the difficulty of propagating the scale factor need to use multiple cameras. Throughout the paper we have identified several advantages of combining laser and visual sensors. Our experimental results are encouraging and give us valuable insight into the possibilities offered by this composite sensor approach We have considered several research directions that could be pursued to improve the results obtained so far. We have thought about extending our algorithm with loop closure de 


tection. This would allow the algorithm to detect previously visited locations and improve the accuracy of mapping and the precision in the estimation of the robot pose. Being able to detect previously visited places is of great importance to solve the problem of global localization and to recover the robot from kidnapping, a situation occurring when the robot is displaced by something out of its control \(e.g. taking an elevator, being transported from one location to another Therefore, solving the loop closure problem will not only improve SLAM performance, but will as well enable new capabilities Further work will concentrate on an extension of the PSM algorithm to exploit the information about vertical lines detected using omnidirectional images. Segmentation of the ground \(floor a dense \(textured onto the geometric model of the world. Finally, we believe the general approach can be extended to solve the full six degrees of freedom \(6DOF active field of research REFERENCES 1] L.Charbonnier and O.Strauss, A suitable polygonal approximation for laser range finder data, Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles 95 Symposium, Detroit, Mi, 1995, pp 118-123 2] J.Nieto, T.Bailey and E.Nebot, Recursive scan-matching SLAM Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 55, 2007, pp 39-49 3] J.S.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
