A top-k query calculation algorithm in distributed networks with probabilistic guarantees Wenting Yu 1  Yanming Shen 1 KeqiuLi 1  Junfeng Xu 1  Yong Li 2 1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering Dalian University of Technology China 2 School of Information Science and Technology Dalian Maritime University China Abstract Top-k queries based on ranking elements stop query processing when the top-k ranked results can be safely determined There are two main methods for top-k query accurate top-k query and approximate top-k query However existing top-k query consumes much bandwidth Motivated by userís goal to identify one or a few relevant data behind top-k query it is attractive to use approximate top-k query algorithms to reduce the bandwidth usage In this paper we propose a three-phase approximate algorithm TPAA which is based on determining the value difference of the same object in different nodes TPAA precuts the object whose values have big difference in different nodes By precutting the illegitimate objects with a high probability TPAA can reduce bandwidth consumption with high precision in some cases It also supports probabilistic pruning of candidates considerably reducing bandwidth usage at the expense of a small loss in precision of the top-k results Furthermore by performance evaluations using both theoretical analysis and computer simulations we show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the bandwidth usage compared with existing probabilistic algorithms Key words Distributed Network Top-k Query Algorithm Probabilistic guarantees Bloom lter 1 Introduction Top-k queries compute the results which are most relevant to a query Top-k query is widely used in the web search engine and arises in many important applications such as multimedia similarity search on feature vectors of image or preference queries over semistructured data Recently the research over the top-k query has been an active research topic The family of threshold algorithms\(TA is the well known approaches developed by 1 2 3 Ho wever TA is overly conservative given that the algorithm may nd top-100 when top-10 is requested Pei Cao  proposes Three-Phase Uniform Threshold algorithm TPUT which redesigns the calculation of the threshold and at the same time estimates the upper and lower bounds in order to reduce the interactive information Meanwhile the idea of approximate top-k query has been around in many areas It is reasonable that users want to nd one or a few relevant data of top-k ranking instead of nding exactly the k best matches to a query Theobald  introduces an approximate top-k query model that approximate top-k results are related to the probabilistic guarantees by modifying the sorted-TA In this paper we present TPAA and propose a difference parameter p to get the approximate top-k result in distributed retrieval systems We prune the object if the object values in different nodes have big difference Our approach is based on the object difference if we know object value in some nodes If the difference is big the object has the low probability to be top-k If the probability is very low we drop the object The precision and efﬁciency of the developed method is experimentally evaluated and compared with the Probabilistic Progressive algorithm Prob-pro in  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents TPAA Section 3 describes the simulation results Concluding remarks are given in Section 4 2 Three-Phase Approximate Algorithm TPAA Assume that there are m nodes and one management node to form a centralized data management topology each node is a list of  o value o  pairs where o is a URL and value o is the total visits to the URL and it also means the popularity of the url When the management node asks for top-k query the answer to the query is an ordered top-k 


score set of urls where the ordering is based on the popularity of the urls In our model we deﬁne the following notation o i object i n i node i v i  o d  value of the object d at node i v max  n i  value which ranks at the rst From the deﬁnition the global value of an object V  o x  m 002 i 1 v i  o x  1 Top-k query is to nd the largest k V  o x   When top-k query algorithm is executed some objects and their values are sent to the management node n i reports the object list which is set i If o y doesn’t appear in set i  we call o y is missing in node i Deﬁnition 1 If we just consider the true value of o x  and the missing object value is 0 the worst sum WS can be calculated WS  O x  m 002 i 1 v 002 i  o x  003 v 002 i  o x  v i  o x  o x 002 set i v 002 i  o x  o x  002 set i 2 Deﬁnition 2 If the missing object value is replaced by 002 the largest probable value o x in n i  the best sum BS can be calculated BS  O x  m 002 i 1 v 002 i  o x  003 v 002 i  o x  v i  o x  o x 002 set i v 002 i  o x  002 o x  002 set i 3 2.1 The Histogram Blooms Structure The histogram blooms structure  is used for data compression Some objects in the node have little impact on topk result We only need to know the range of those objects then the true top-k result may be determined For simplicity we assume the node histograms are equi-width consisting of n cells each cell being responsible for v max  n i  n score range In Fig 1 X axis represents the object value ranges Y axis shows the number of the objects whose values are between the value ranges Each rectangle represents one cell c i in Fig 1 each cell maintains the following information 1 The upper and lower values UV  c i   LV  c i   Figure 1 An equi-width histogram each node pre-computes for each object 2 The average value avg  c i   computed over all scores in the cell then divided by the number of the objects in the cell 3 Object name list filter  c i   it stores the objects whose values fall in this cell In particular it is constructed using Bloom lter 4 The number of objects fall in each cell f requency  c i   Bloom lter works as follow A bitmap V containing b bits initially all set to 0  the objects set S  o 1 o 2 o 3 o n  Since o i uses h independent hash functions h 1  h 2  h h  o 1 in set S can generate h different hash values Each hash values vary from 1 to b Then we set the bitmap V the corresponding bit 1 the bitmap is bloom lter Testing if o x belongs to the set S we use the same hash functions and generate h 1  o x   h h  o x   If not all the corresponding bits are 1  o x  does not belong to set S If all the corresponding bits are 1 o x may belong to set S this is referred to as a false positive Given the number of objects s by tuning h and b one can control the probability for false positives which is given by PFP 003 1  e  hs  b  h  where s is the number of object in set S  b is the s ize o f the bitmap/ﬁlter and h is the number of hash functions 2.2 Algorithm The main idea in our algorithm is that the value difference should be small if the object is the top-k p is deﬁned as the threshold of the value difference There are three steps for the TPAA algorithm the algorithm nishes when all the three steps take one round-trip

4.1 Dealing with Complex Hazard Functions As indicated before one of the main problems dealing with malicious acts such as intrusions or other attacks are the different degrees of unpredictability In this was captured with the introduction of so-called UUUR events Unpredictable latent Unobserved and Unobservable Risks In order to assess the consequences of UUUR events survival analysis with its sister elds competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis were introduced in and 16 respecti v ely  A three-layer survi vability analysis architecture was introduced that consisted of tactical strategic and operational levels This architecture allows to integrate reliability hybrid fault models and survivability under a uniìed paradigm A comprehensive introduction of three-layer survivability analysis is beyond the scope of this paper Here we only brieîy discuss one aspect of the tactical level dealing with complex hazard functions We completely skip the strategic and operational level modeling which can be found in and In the absence of UUUR events the tactical level is largely equivalent to traditional reliability analysis Indeed the most fundamental deìnition in survival analysis is the survivor function S  t  Pr  T>t   which has the exact same deìnition as the reliability function The hazard function h  t  and the cumulative hazard functions H  t  even use the same terminology besides the common mathematical deìnitions However there are additional advantages from introducing survival analysis over the traditional reliability analysis Major advantages of survival analysis are i more exible time-variant and covariates-dependent hazard functions ii built-in procedures to deal with censored events iii multivariate failure beyond binary failure and iv more effective modeling of dependent failure events through competing risks and shared frailty modeling Details can be found in 13 14 15 Our interest is with regard to the hazard functions listed in the advantages of i Therefore we now brieîy introduce several forms of hazard functions from survival analysis to show one of the advantages of adopting survival analysis The simplest type of hazard function is the constant hazard function which is when the failure time follows exponential distribution It takes the form h  t   1 With the original Cox Proportional Hazards Model PHM the hazard function becomes time and covariates dependent   t z   0  t  e Z 2 where Z is the vector of covariates such as environment factors that inîuence the hazard function and  o  t  is the baseline hazard function The Cox PHM has been extended numerously e.g 18  T w o simple e xtensions the stratiìed Cox PHM and the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates are of particular interest and their applicability will be discussed below First we introduce the stratiìed Cox PHM Suppose there is a factor that occurs on q levels and for which the socalled proportionality assumption of PHM may be violated The hazard function for an individual in the j th stratum or level of this factor is  j  t z   0 j  t  e Z 3 for j 1  2   q  The baseline hazard function  01       0 q    for the q strata are permitted to be arbitrary and are completely unrelated The second generalization to the PHM is the Cox PHM with time-dependent covariates Here the covariates Z depend on time t  i.e Z  Z  t   For unstratiìed PHM the hazard function is   t  z  t    0  t  e Z  t   4 and for stratiìed PHM it is  j  t  z  t    0 j  t  e Z  t   j 1  2   q 5 With the increase of the hazard function complexity from Equation 1 to 5 their descriptive power and exibility also increase For example the stratiìed PHM Equations 3 and 5 may be used to formulate a uniìed hazard function for various levels of security alerts e.g low medium and high The choice of the hazard function that can be used has signiìcant implications on the complexity of the system analysis 4.2 Model Changes and State Changes The view of the functionality-based analysis model described above has several advantages in theory 1 Different functionalities can have different fault descriptions 2 Different functionalities can utilize different hazard functions 3 Each functionality may change its fault description and/or hazard function in time The rst advantage is the exibility to view the fault description of each functionality in isolation This design for analyzability feature allows for ease of analysis The second advantage is signiìcant since the type of hazard function has huge implications on the complexity of the analysis Note that the term complexity is not to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


interpreted as computational complexity but as the complexity of the approach Having the exibility of selecting an appropriate hazard function for individual functionalities rather than for the entire complex system allows to study the effects of speciìc assumptions about failing rates This way one can move in the trade-off space of simplicity of analysis versus accuracy of the hazard function For example the simple hazard function of Equation 1 is suitable for the analysis of certain functionalities but it is not generally suitable for malicious act From an analysis point of view it is desirable to select the least complicated hazard function suitable for each functionality Thus just because certain aspects of the systems may be subjected to UUUR events the entire system does not have to use the complicated hazard model The third advantage is the exibility to consider the analysis in different phases with potentially different hazard functions at different stages This can be modeled using a state machine Consider the three different threat levels e.g low medium and high one may use the stratiìed Cox PHM model expressed with Equations 3 and 5 Such system may adapt to threat levels announced by some authority The system hazard function may transition from one stratum to another when the threat levels change For example the sequence h i   h k   h j   h i would represent a system that transitions through various states strata each with their respective hazard functions The sequence could be from the state machine shown in Figure 1  h i h k h j Figure 1 Thread Model State Machine 5 Fault Model Adaptation As information becomes available that may change the systemês landscape changes to the system model or parameters need to be considered Such adaptation is considered to be an integrated feature in any design for survivability For example in 6 survi v ability w a s described in terms of Resistance Recognition Recover and Adaptation Adaptation implemented the mechanism to adapt the system to knowledge gained in the prior three phases Our interest is primarily in adaptation related to the fault model Adaptation may be the result of diverse scenarios such as 1 The fault description F i is no longer valid due to a speciìc event For example intelligence suggests that authentication may be compromised As a result fault types that are not reîected in F i may occur 2 The fault description of f i should be strengthened by design This may be the result of analysis indicating that a functionality may be the weakest link 3 The infrastructure that f i relied on has changed The implications of this change on the fault description need to be evaluated Of special interest is the case where the infrastructure may not be able to support tolerance of certain fault types In general adaptation is viewed to address the dynamics of changes in fault descriptions F i  which however has to be addressed in the context of the capabilities of the system or infrastructure that supports functionality f i  Thus we want to be able to point out if there is a mismatch between 1 what is assumed or implemented by f i and 2 inherently theoretically possible in the system We deìne the active fault description as the fault model that the system currently subscribes to i.e the faults that f i assumes to be able to tolerate or deal with Thus for functionality f i the fault description F i is the active fault description The speciìcation of F i is determined by the system designer or more speciìcally by the designer of f i  The real question that remains is whether the systemês infrastructure can support this F i  In contrast to the active fault description the imposed fault description denoted by  F i  is the fault model that the infrastructure of the system or application imposes on f i  It encompasses those fault types that the system has to explicitly deal with by distinct mechanisms For example  F i  b s  indicates that for the given infrastructure benign and symmetric faults are possible and theoretically unavoidable However note that  F i does not list asymmetric faults The reason is that the infrastructure is assumed to be capable of theoretically eliminating this fault type An infrastructure that has an imposed fault description  F i  b s  is a broadcast network In such a network asymmetric faults are not possible due to the fact that every module in the broadcast domain can see every message The active and imposed fault descriptions can serve the system designers to analyze the survivability of f i  Letês consider the authentication example in a general network environment under the fault model of and assume that messages are signed First we assume that point-to-point communication e.g TCP/IP is used Furthermore consider the two cases where 1 TCP/IP provides reliable transmission and 2 when TCP may time out With respect to the infrastructure in case 1 this leads to an imposed fault description of  F i  s a   meaning that there are no benign Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


faults However value faults both symmetric and asymmetric cannot be resolved without explicit mechanisms If we consider case 2 in which TCP may time out then  F i  b s a   Next letês consider the active fault descriptions If our authentication scheme is assumed to be uncompromisable then F i  b   otherwise it is F i  b s a   The interesting case in the example above is when authentication is compromised Value faults cannot be dealt with unless the authentication mechanism is implemented to provide redundancy levels of N  2 s 1 and N  3 a 1 for symmetric and asymmetric behavior respectively Note that in order to avoid common mode faults the redundant modules should be dissimilar In order to deal with symmetric faults one needs a simple majority of unaffected modules However asymmetric faults do not only require a higher degree of redundancy but also require that agreement algorithms be used These algorithms typically work in rounds of message exchanges The result is high message overhead in addition to the high component count However since in our example the imposed and active fault descriptions both contain s and a  there is no easy way around having to deal with these faults explicitly For the system designer the choices seem clear 1 one lives with the risk of authentication compromises or 2 one pays the cost of module and message overhead But how high is that cost This depends on how many faults of type s and a one wants to tolerate In addition common mode faults need to be addresses and thus the cost of dissimilar components needs to be considered Design Changes The advantage of working with imposed fault description is that it gives insight about what the infrastructure cannot inherently deal with This allows for adaptation that can bring signiìcant simpliìcations to the application Consider the example above and assume that authentication may be compromised i.e assume that F i   F i  b s a   The largest challenge is to avoid having to deal with costly asymmetric faults However the infrastructure cannot tolerate such faults implicitly and thus explicit mechanisms such as agreement algorithms must be used Therefore letês consider what changes can be made to the infrastructure in order to avoid asymmetric faults With respect to networking this is actually quite simple As indicated before a broadcast environment cannot exhibit asymmetric behavior Therefore assume that point-to-point networking in authentication is eliminated and that broadcasting is used instead Under the broadcast paradigm every node can see the same messages so that Byzantine faults can be immediately detected Now  F i  b s   and thus the application can provide simple mechanisms to take advantage of the imposed tolerance to asymmetric faults Thus by observing the limitations of the imposed fault description an infrastructure-related change can make large improvements Adaptive Policies In the previous example the design of the authentication mechanism was motivated by low cost which resulted in an active model considering only benign faults If value faults are suspected then the high cost of dealing with value faults most signiìcantly asymmetric faults was required However in most applications the worse case behavior e.g broken authentication may be only of importance during times of high threat levels This suggest a security policy that is exible and sensitive to the threat level Such a policy would select the lowest overhead solution possible under a given threat level In our authentication example this could mean using the benign model under normal situations and augmenting value faults if the threat level is high Such gear shifting is not new and has been used in the context of agreement algorithms to reduce overhead Infrastructure Changes Lastly if the infrastructure used by functionalities f i changes then one should consider if these changes have implications on the imposed fault description If they do then perhaps one can take advantage of this change On the other hand it may mean that now the limitations of the infrastructure need to be compensated by more sophisticated solutions An example of such degeneration is when a network changes from a broadcast to a point-to-point communication primitive In all the cases above the careful analysis of F i and  F i should be undertaken Misjudging the fault model can render the application non-survivable 6 Conclusions A new view of fault models was presented that shifted away from the fault cause and instead focused on the effect of faults This allows for the use of fault models in the analysis of systems operating in hostile environments A general view of design for survivability was adopted This implied that the application and infrastructure were viewed in concert in order to determine which fault models they required and supplied By viewing a system as a collection of functionalities each functionality could be separately analyzed This simpliìed the determination of the active and imposed fault description which was then used to determine a mapping between what the application functionality required and what the infrastructure could or could not support In the latter case explicit solutions must be used to overcome the infrastructure induced limitations With respect to system analysis the functionality-based view of the system allowed exibility in the choice of hazard functions Rather than using one model for the entire system now each functionality can be analyzed using its appropriate hazard functions

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence

It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
