 Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs  Fig.6  mfs and Fuzzy rules in Traditional algorithms Table 10 and Figure 7 reflect the relationship between the minimum correlation coefficient \(min_corr\d fuzzy positive and negative association rules \(FPNAR\where the former is used to remove those frequent fuzzy itemsets of weak correlation. Table 10 presents the number of fuzzy positive and negative association rules, which are generated with min_corr varying from 1 to 2.8 under such preconditions as mfs = [0.3, 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, 0.1, 0.08 d  m f c  0.6.As can be seen from Figure 7, with the min_corr increasing, the number of fuzzy association rules attained shows an obvious decreasing trend, as the minimum correlation coefficient can eliminate the rules which are generated by frequent itemsets of weak correlation, leaving more meaningful rules. So, the minimum correlation coefficient can effectively remove those meaningless or less meaningful rules to ensure that the final mined fuzzy rules are meaningful TABLE X  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MIN _ CORR AND FPNAR mfs\(k\=[0.3,0.2,0.16,0.12,0.1,0  m fc 0 6  min_corr= 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.7 2.0 2.3 2.5 2.8 PAR 326 292 249 192 133 106 72 44 NAR 604 522 435 322 193 130 80 48 TotalRules 930 814 684 514 326 236 152 92  Fig.7  relationship between min_corr and FPNAR According to the above analysis, the algorithm is adopted to mine rules from the rock sample data set.

Compared with the traditional fuzzy association rules mining algorithm, this algorithm solves the problem about the selection of fuzzy support, and generates more accurate and effective fuzzy positive and negative association rules VI  CONCLUSION There are broad development space and prospects for the mining fuzzy positive and negative association rules however, there are still many drawbacks in the selection of the membership function and minimum support, and the accuracy of selected parameters directly affects the result of the final mining rules. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy positive and negative association rules algorithm for the first time, and utilize k-means clustering method to determine the membership function, avoiding uncertainty problems which may be brought about in current existed related algorithms that need to identify the membership function subjectively Meanwhile, the multi-level fuzzy support and the correlation coefficient criterion are introduced based on fuzzy positive and negative association rules. In the end, the proposed algorithm is proved to be more effective and accurate in comparison with the traditional algorithm through an experiment REFERENCES 000>\000\024\000  R. Agrawal, T.
