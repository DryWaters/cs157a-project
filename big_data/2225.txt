In this paper, we conduct comprehensive\nevaluations on three representative data center systems based on\nBigDataBench, which is a benchmark suite for benchmarking and\nranking systems running big data applications. Then we explore\nthe relative performance of the three implementation approaches\nwith different big data applications, and provide strong guidance\nfor the data center system construction.\nThrough our experiments, we has inferred that a data center\nsystem based on speci?c hardware has different performance in\nthe context of different applications and data volumes. When\nwe construct a system we can take into account not only the\nperformance or energy consumption of the pure hardwares, but\nalso the application-level characteristics. Data scale, application\ntype and complexity should be considered comprehensively when\nresearchers or architects plan to choose fundamental components\nfor their data center system.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWe can hardly stop the world creating data, and it is not easy\nto estimate how much data is produced every day. According\nto IDC \(International Data Corporation is expected to grow to 2.7 zettabytes during 2012.\nThis is an increase of 48% from 2011 [1]. The rapid growth\nof data volumes brings big challenges to the construction of\ndata center platforms, and makes lots of existing solutions no\nlonger applicable. In response to this trend, both academia\nand industry are looking for innovative ways to deal with\nlarge-scale data. The distributed cluster system is a kind of\nsolutions which is adopted by many organizations. However,\ndata volumes are growing to the point where companies are\nbeing forced to strengthen their infrastructure, for example, by\nadding more nodes or replacing with more powerful hardware.\nThe infrastructure costs and energy consumption skyrocket\nalong this way. Then, how to select proper hardware for\ndata center construction, and how to ?nd a balance between\nprocessing capacity and energy costs become the questions\nwhich are urgently to be solved.\nBecause of architectural difference, con?guration variance,\nand other factors, different hardware have their own processing\nspecialities, which would make them show diverse behaviors\nwhen dealing with types of applications. For example, Xeon\nseries are equipped with higher processing frequency, which\nmakes Xeon commonly applied to some scenarios involving\ncomplex calculations. While, Atom series usually appear in\nsome scenarios which treat low power as the key Architects\nare searching for a approach to take good use of different kinds\nof hardware resources to construct a balanced system. And\n?nding appropriate hardware fundamental components for the\nworkloads counts for much more in data center construction.\nIn this paper, we analyze the processing performance of\ndifferent big data systems through driving them with various\nworkloads, and then to ?nd some implications on the relation-\nship between applications and data center system. We select\na big data benchmark suite – BigDataBench [2] to evaluate\nthree kinds of big data systems – Xeon, Atom, and Tilera.\nThrough experimental results collected, we nd that the merits\nof a system is not only determined by hardware equipment,\nbut also relative to the application type and the data volume\nrunning on it. A system may be going to be favorable for some\napplications, and show both better energy performance and\nprocessing capacity when handling certain workloads within\nspeci?c range of data volume. So, when architects choose\nfundamental components for their systems, they can not only\nconsider the performance or energy consumption of hardware\nitself, but also need to regard the application type, data volume\nand the complexity of the application the system will run for.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section\n2 introduces our evaluation methodology. Section 3 elaborates\nthe basic analysis on hardware platforms and workloads.\nSection 4 discusses the experimental results based on three\nbig data systems, and carries on the comparative analysis to\nthe processing result Section 5 concludes the paper.\nII. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we will give the brief information about the\nhardware platforms we evaluate, the Benchmark we use and\n,\(\(\(,QWHUQDWLRQDO&RQIHUHQFHRQ%LJ'DWD\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE \nTABLE I\nTHE BASIC CONFIGURATION OF XEON\nCPU Type Intel R©Xeon E5310\nCPU Core 4 cores @ 1.6GHz\nL1 I/D Cache 32KB\nL2 Cache 512KB\nTABLE II\nTHE BASIC CONFIGURATION OF ATOM\nCPU Type Intel R©Atom D510\nCPU Core 2 cores @ 1.66GHz\nL1 I/D Cache 24KB\nL2 Cache 512KB\nthe metrics we choose.\nA. Experimental Platforms\nWe choose platforms based on their popularity in industry\nand academia. Xeon and Atom are widely used in many\nacademic institutions and internet 


service providers, and Tilera\nis a kind of burgeoning CPU. What’s more, these three plat-\nforms have great differences on their architecture. The basic\ninformations of them are showed in TABLE I, TABLE II, and\nTABLE III. We construct different-sized system using these\nhardware, then deploy Hadoop on them. Hadoop is an open-\nsource software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing\n[3], and it is adopted in data center system construction by\nmany companies, such as Facebook [4], IBM [5], NREL [6],\netc. The Hadoop version we used is Hadoop-1.0.2. And three\nclusters are supplied with same Hadoop setting referring to\nthe guidance on Hadoop of?cial website.\nTo be fair to comparison, we guarantee at least one dimen-\nsion of two systems to be the same. For Xeon and Atom,\nwe construct the cluster on them with one master and seven\nslaves, while, for Tilera, the system is consisted of one master\nand one slaves. There are 4 cores in a Xeon CPU with one\nhardware thread per core, and 2 cores in an Atom CPU with\ntwo hardware threads per core. So, the Xeon and Atom system\nhave the same hardware thread number. The Tilera CPU we\nused has 36 tiles \(core is named as tile in Tilera Selection\nWe attempt to ?nd some underlying relations between work-\nloads and different big data systems in this paper, especially\nthe impacts of the application type, and data volume on\ndifferent platforms. So, we need a benchmark, which can\nTABLE III\nTHE BASIC CONFIGURATION OF TILERA\nCPU Type Tilera R©TilePro36\nCPU Core 36 cores @ 500MHz\nL1 I/D Cache 16KB/8KB\nL2 Cache 64KB\nprovide typical applications, and can offer data sets of any\nvolume. BigDataBench meets these all.\nBigDataBench is a big data benchmark suite from web\nsearch engines It provides six kinds of applications which\nare typically employed in search engines, including Sort,\nGrep Wordcount, Naive Bayes, SVM and search [7]. Because\nthe search application are effected by data volume as well\nas submission interval which we don’t care about in this\npaper, we don’t adopt this application in our experiments. And\nthen, applications like Sort, Grep, Wordcount, have disparate\nexecution behaviors compared with Naive Bayes and SVM –\nNaive Bayes and SVM have higher computation complexity\nthan the others. This will help us obtain more comprehensive\nresults. BigDataBench also provides a data generation tool\nto overcome dif?culties of obtaining real big data. This tool\ngenerates big data based on small-scale data while preserv-\ning the key characteristics of real data. This can make our\nexperimental results more reasonable.\nC Metrics\nWe call for some metrics which can be directly perceived,\nand be compared and gotten easily. Also these metrics should\nre?ect the integrated processing capacity of a data center. We\nevaluate the performance of data center systems from two\naspects – processing capacity and energy consumption, and the\ncorresponding metrics we adopt are the DPS \(Data processed\nper second Data processed per joule  metrics aren’t inclined to the computing power of the\nCPU or bandwidth of I/O. They place emphasis on estimating\nthe processing capacity of the whole system. We record the\nvolume and run time of workloads, and use a power meter\nto measure energy consumption, then calculate the DPS/DPJ\naccording to formulas 1 and 2 below:\nDPS =\nData Input Size\nRun Time\n\(1 2 HARDWARE PLATFORMS AND\nWORKLOADS\nIn this part, we will analyze some basic details of hardware\nand workloads to lay the foundation for the analysis in section\n4.\nA. Hardware Analysis\n1 Xeon is showed\nin TABLE I. In the ?eld of industry, Xeon usually is used to\ndeal with resource-intensive applications, like JAVA or PHP,\nwhich is different from Atom. Xeon E5310 is based on Intel\nCore Microarchitecture [9] which also treats energy ef?ciency\nas a design goal. The chip we used has 4 cores per CPU\nwith 1.6GHz basic frequency, supporting multiple arithmetic\nand many instruction set such as MMX, SSE and etc. TDP\n\(Thermal Design Power which means it has\n32\none hardware thread per core. It adopts the Intel SpeedStep\ntechnology to adjustment the power according to the demand.\n2 some real-time applications. All of these\ntasks split a problem into many pieces in order to leverage\neach core’s processing power. The con?guration information is\nshowed in TABLE II. Atom D510 is based on Intel Pine Trail\narchitecture [10], supporting hyper-threading technology. The\nTDP of Atom is 13W. Atom processor is based on a micro-\narchitecture different from mainstream ones, which uses the\nIn-Order Execution to reduce power consumption. However,\nthis is bound to affect processing performance. Therefore,\nAtom core introduce the hyper-threading \(HT adoption of HT technology improves parallelism\nand make up for the lack of powerful execution architecture.\n3 Tilera: Tilera is a Many-Core processor for cloud ap-\nplications such as memcached, media, and Hadoop [11 In\norder for the tiles \(cores Architecture provides a\ncommunication fabric called the iMesh which differ from BUS\nin Intel Architecture Tilera also aims at lower power ef?ciency\nto adapt to massive-scale clusters. The core number of Tilera\nseries ranges from 16 to 100. The information of Tilera we\nused is showed in TABLE III. It has 36 cores on chip 


with\nintegrated cache, supported by 2 dimensional on-chip mesh\nnetwork, and, the tiles \(cores if need. The TDP\nof TilePro36 is 16W, and Tilera does not support ?oating point\noperations.\nB. Workloads Analysis\nWe choose ?ve out of six applications from BigDataBench.\nFor each application, the core operations are different. From\npaper [13] and [14], I/O wait time means the time spent by\nCPU waiting for I/O operations to complete. A high percentage\nof I/O wait time means that the application has I/O operations\nfrequently which further indicates that the application is an\nI/O intensive workload. Starting from this point, we describe\neach application.\n• Sort: Sort simply uses the MapReduce framework to\nsort records within a directory. It is a representative I/O\nintensive application.\n• Wordcount: Wordcount reads text ?les and counts how\noften the words occur. It is a representative CPU intensive\napplication, accompanied with lighter network and disk\nload.\n• Grep: There are two processes in grep, the ?rst step\nis to ?nd the words provided by users and count the\nnumber of occurrences, the next step is to sort the words\nby their occurrences. In general, Grep is a CPU intensive\napplication.\n• Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic\nclassi?er which applied the Bayes’ theorem with strong\n\(naive our workloads rather than the train-\ning step. The main process is to calculate the probability,\nTABLE IV\nDETAILS OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS\nApplication Time Complexity Characteristics\nSort O\(n× log2n comparison\nWordCount O\(n n m× n Floating-point computation\nSVM O\(n3 existing\nmodel. It belongs to CPU intensive application.\n• SVM: SVM is supervised learning models with associ-\nated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize\npatterns, used for classi?cation and regression analysis.\nSVM is the most complex application in all ?ves. The\nmain process of it is vector calculus, and it is a typical\nCPU intensive application.\nIV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nIn this part, we will report the experimental data collected\nin general, then analyze the performance difference of these\nbig data systems through comparison.\nA. General Description\nTo decide proper dataset to drive these systems, we initially\nrun the experiments using datasets with 500MB and 100GB,\nto get approximate processing capacity of system. During the\nexperiments, we ?nd that the SVM is the most time-consuming\napplication, and the variation of its DPS/DPJ is very small, so\nwe determine to run the SVM with maximum 25G on Xeon\nand Atom. From paper [8], we know that the ?oating point\noperations in SVM is the most among ?ve applications. Tilera\nhas no ?oating-point unit. It will change the ?oating point\noperation into some basic operations, then it will cost more\ntime. Considering this, we don’t adopt the SVM in the Tilera\ntesting. In order to aggrandize the stability of our results,\nfor every experiment, we run at least two times, taking the\naverage value to eliminate bias caused by uncertainty factors\nas possible. Normally, the run time of the same workload are\nsimilar, however, there are existing some abnormal results,\nsuch as one execution time is much higher than the others.\nThese may be caused by Hadoop abnormal execution – having\ntoo many failed tasks, or the interference from the operating\nsystem self-check For these kinds of results, we don’t take it\ninto our mean value calculation.\nFig. 1 to Fig. 6 display the nal DPS and DPJ of three\nbig data systems. From these ?gures, we have following\nobservations. Firstly, Grep has the highest DPS/DPJ value,\nthen Wordcount, Sort, and Naive Bayes. SVM has the smallest\nones. Secondly, for most applications, along with an increase\nin the amount of input data, the DPS/DPJ ?rst rise, and then\nkeep stable, thereamong, the curve of Sort appears relatively\nobvious downtrend when the data volume arrive to a certain\nvalue, and the variation of SVM curve is minimal. Last, the\npro?le of the DPS and the DPJ curve of one system are\nsimilar. Further, we ?nd that the performance indicated by the\n33\nFig. 1. The DPS of Xeon Platform Fig. 2. The DPJ of Xeon Platform\nFig. 3. The DPS of Atom Platform Fig. 4. The DPJ of Atom Platform\nFig. 5. The DPS of Tilera Platform Fig. 6. TThe DPJ of Tilera Platform\n34\nDPS/DPJ and the growth rate of the curves are closely linked\nwith the complexity of the application. TABLE IV records the\ncomputation complexity of the ?ve applications. Basically, the\neasier the application is, the higher its DPS/DPJ are. Sort is a\ntypical I/O-intensive application, and its processing capability\ntrend is mostly impacted by the I/O operations. The large per-\ncentage of I/O wait time elongates the Sort’s execution time,\nthen reduces the processing capability. While, for Wordcount\nand Grep, they are not I/O-intensive application, when the\nsystem’s resource is fully used, the processing capability is\nunchanged. For the complex applications like SVM, Naive\nBayes, the changes of the DPS/DPJ is not obvious with the\nincreasing of data volume, this may be caused by the usage of\nCPU. For this kind of applications, CPU is always treated as\nbottleneck, the computational resources are fully used when\neven running small dataset. Observing the format 1 and 2,\nwe know that, for the DPS/DPJ execution time is the most\nin?uential factor. This explains why the curve of the DPS\nand the DPJ are similar Then we dissect the performance\ndifference through comparison.\nB. The Comparison of Xeon and Atom\nBoth of Xeon and Atom platforms consist of one master and\nseven slaves, and the hardware thread number of two systems\nare 


the same \(the details of hardware can be found in TABLE\nI and TABLE II showed in Fig 1 to 4.\nThen Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 demonstrate the DPS and the DPJ\ncomparison of Xeon and Atom Obviously, there is a big\ngap between Xeon and Atom on processing capacity. The\napplication type and data volume do an enormous in?uence on\nthe DPS for both platforms. For Sort, the distance between the\nDPS of Xeon and Atom comes closer as the volume of data\nincreases, yet, for Wordcount, Grep, Naive Bayes, it comes\nfarer with the increasing process. SVM shows relatively stable\nstate. We can also see this from TABLE V. TABLE V shows\nthe ratio of Xeon’s DPS/DPJ and Atom’s. We can know that\nthe processing capacity of Xeon basically keeps about 2 to\n4 times higher than Atom at most of the time. For Sort,\nWordcount, Grep, the ratio changes variably under different\ndata size, and for Naive Bayes and SVM, the variation of ratio\nvaries in a small range. The reason why the DPS/DPJ present\nsuch trend may like this. Sort is a I/O intensive application\nmentioned above The increment of data volume will give rises\nto the stress of I/O, which weaken the effects from the CPU\nprocessing capacity. To Wordcount, Grep, Naive Bayes, when\nusing small dataset, CPU resources are not fully utilized, so\nthe difference between the two DPS is small. After increasing\nthe amount of data, CPU performance distance is re?ected.\nThe basic frequency of Xeon and Atom core are 1.6 GHz\nand 1.66 GHz, and their hardware thread number on per\nprocessor is the same. The performance difference mainly\ncomes from the pipeline structure. For Xeon, it supports Out-\nOf-Order execution while Atom don’t, and the work speed\nis optimized through the pipelining design which leads to\nbetter processing capacity. For SVM, the CPU utilization are\nFig. 11. The Speedup between Xeon and Atom\nhigh from the beginning to both platforms which differ from\nthe Sort application. When using 500M dataset, the CPU\nutilization of Sort only 59% on Atom, while SVM arrives\nto 87%. So, to the SVM, the volume of dataset doesn’t have a\nbig in?uence to the two systems processing capacity distance.\nIn the meantime, we take the energy consumption into\nconsideration. Atom is designed primarily for energy con-\nservation. From the Fig. 8, to Sort, Wordcount, Grep, when\nthe size of dataset reaches to a certain value \(above 1GB or\n10GB for our experimental platforms consumption\nadvantages of Atom are re?ected. This is because of the Xeon\nsystem hasn’t been fully used under small data volume, and\nits energy consumption isn’t high in this situation. To Naive\nBayes, Atom does not show the energy strength. This is caused\nby too long execution time. Combined with TABLE V, we\nsee the DPS of SVM on Xeon is more than 3 times higher\nthan Atom’s, and the DPJ of Atom is only 1.5 times higher\nthan Xeon’s all the time, which implies that the Atom is not\nsuitable for such applications either. To further explain this,\nwe adopt the HPL \(High Performance Computing Linpack\nBenchmark Atom\nby the execution time on Xeon to get the speedup. The Fig.\n11 shows the result. From the ?gure, we learn that the HPL has\nthe highest speedup, then Naive Bayes and SVM. The larger\nvalue signi?es that it will take more time to deal with this\napplication. For example, it may take 4 times if using Atom\nrather than Xeon, even Xeon cost more energy, it take less\ntime, the ratio of energy and time still may be lower. And that\nis the reason why the Atom don’t re?ect the energy advantage\nwhen handling the complex applications.\nC. The Comparison of Xeon and Tilera\nThe Tilera processor we use has 36 tiles \(cores cores to guarantee the core number of two systems\nto be the same. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are the DPS and the DPJ\nof Tilera system. By observing the results, we ?nd that on\nXeon and Atom, the DPS of Wordcount is larger than Sort,\nwhile on Tilera, the situation is just the opposite. As we talked\n35\nFig. 7. The Comparison of DPS between Xeon and Atom\nFig. 8. The Comparison of DPJ between Xeon and Atom\n36\nFig. 9. The Comparison of DPS between Xeon and Tilera\nFig. 10.

More, it provides virtual L3 cahce, which\nmeans, if misses in the L2 cache on a certain tile are satis?ed\nby caches in other tiles, it will get this data otherwise, Tilera\nwill fetch data from external memory and deliver it to the\nrequesting core. This structure makes Tilera have a more\n?exible cache access strategy, then makes Tilera more suitable\nfor I/O intensive application, like Sort. Wordcount is a CPU\nintensive application, and Tilera is weak on CPU processing\ncapacity. This may cause the difference comparing with Xeon\nand Atom.\nFrom the Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 


we obtain that the processing\ncapacity of Xeon is better than Tilera, while Tilera has better\nenergy performance. Nevertheless, except Sort, the DPS of\nXeon is around 6 times on average than the DPS of Atom,\nand the DPS of Atom is slightly more than one time than that\nof Xeon. TABLE VI shows the ratio of Xeon’s DPS/DPJ and\nTilera’s. This implies that the Tilera is more appropriate for I/O\nintensive applications rather than CPU intensive ones. Tilera\ncombines the low-power consumption of slower clock speeds\nwith the increased throughput of many independent cores [4],\n37\n01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n500M 1G 10G 25G 50G\nDPS \(MB/S MB/J Exception of Sort on Atom Platform\nwhich can be used to illustrate the Tilera’s processing features.\nD Supplementary Analysis\nAbove all, we can see that the Xeon cluster has de?nitely\nprocessing advantage in three clusters. We can also deduce that\nthe application behaviors affect the use of system resource,\nwhich lead to the different performance when dealing with\ndiverse workloads. From the TABLE IV, we can see the\nmain operation of SVM and Naive Bayes are all ?oating-\npoint computation. Atom which don’t support OoO execution\nand the Tilera which has no ?oating computing component\nare hard to run such applications, even the Tilera have better\nmechanism for core connecting which may reduce the time\ncosting on the machines communication.\nDuring our experiments, for example, the Sort experiments\non Atom, we found an unusual phenomenon which is showed\nin Fig. 12. For Sort curve, it at ?rst appears a downward\ntrend, then begins to emerge a upward trend. This seems\nto be inconsistent with the conventional. The phenomenon\nmay be caused by data skew or Hadoop task failure. We\nregenerate the testing dataset and re-experiment, then it backs\nto normal. Hadoop is a distribute framework, the data skew\nwill lead to the unbalance of workload for each slave in cluster,\nthen in?uence execution time. We can solve this problem by\nregenerating new dataset, or using a cluster with single slave\nwhen testing a system.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have evaluated three big data systems.\nBased on the above analysis, we have concluded that different\nhardware have their own processing features. A big data\nsystem consisted of speci?c hardware has various performance\nwhen dealing with types of applications and data sets of\ndifferent volume. In some cases, a big data system may\nhave both better processing capacity and energy consumption.\nWhen architects plan to construct big data systems or choose\nfundamental components for a system, they should not only\nconcentrate on the processing capacity and energy consump-\ntion of hardware itself, but also need to regard the application\ntype, data volume and the complexity of the application that\nthe system will handle with.\nMore speci?cally, through our experimental results, we have\nshown Xeon generally has better processing capacity accom-\npanied with high energy consumption, especially to some light\nscale-out applications like Sort, Wordcount, Grep. For some\ncomplex applications like Naive Bayes, SVM, the weaker\nprocessing capability of processor causes long execution time.\nEven the power of them is lower than Xeon, the total energy\nconsumption is still high, which further illustrate that the\nenergy performance is relative to the application type. From\nthe perspective of energy consumption, Tilera exerts a energy\nadvantage on processing I/O intensive application like Sort,\nwhile Atom is more excellent in processing simple CPU\nintensive application like Wordcount and Grep.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe are grateful to our mentors for the many informative\ndiscussions that guided this work and the anonymous review-\ners, who provided excellent feedback.

comparison\nbetween 2-way and n-way execution for Merge Join, MAPSIN\nand PigSPARQL as these systems support n-way joins. In all\ncases, n-way joins clearly outperform a sequential execution of\n2-way joins, while the bene?t for our merge join approach is\nless than for the others. Reducing the amount of MapReduce\ncycles comes at the cost of more data that has to be processed\nat once. As we cannot guarantee that all n matching subsets\nreside on the same machine, more data has to be accessed\nremotely. This is underpinned by Figure 8.b that shows the\namount of data accessed locally and retrieved remotely within\na map-side merge join. However the difference is much less\nthan expected. Processing query 4 with one 5-way merge join\ncompared with several 2-way merge joins increases the amount\nof data retrieved remotely by only 32% while decreasing the\namount of data accessed locally by 34%. This can be explained\ndue to the fact that data is stored with an replication factor\nof three which increases the chances that matching subsets\nreside on the same machine. Except for n-way joins, the\namount of data accessed locally within a merge join is always\nhigher than the amount of data retrieved remotely, which is\nan expected behavior since we choose the larger dataset to be\nprocessed locally Nevertheless, since data locality is a crucial\npoint for distributed systems, improving these values, e.g by\na re?nement of the data placement strategy wrt. matching\nsubsets, is a worthwhile point for future optimizations.\nThe average performance bene?t of our Merge Join com-\npared to the other systems is between 15 and 48%. In order\nto compare the performance of the different systems we com-\nputed for each query the relative difference of execution time to\nthe respective best case. Then, for each system the average of\nthese relative differences over all queries is computed, whereas\nmissing measure points are replaced with a weak penalty value.\nThe penalty is based on the average of all systems that perform\nworse than the best execution time. Finally, we computed the\nrelative performance distance of other systems to our approach\n\(c.f. “relative perf.” in Table II 72 in\ncomparison with Merge Join \(100 JOIN, MAPSIN, PIGSPARQL AND HADOOPRDF IN SECONDS.

It works best for single join queries but performs\nalso good for sequences of joins. However, unselective subject-\nobject or object-subject joins turned out to be a weak point,\nespecially if one join input side is fairly unbalanced. But\neven for those queries, the differences to the fastest query\nexecution times are still acceptable while showing an excel-\nlent scaling behavior at all time. Moreover, our store layout\nenables retrieving one pattern queries even faster than the\nindex-based query execution of MAPSIN. Taken into account\nthat improving data locality by adopting more suitable data\nplacement strategies for Hadoop and preventing unbalanced\npartitions by more sophisticated partitioning strategies will\nfurther improve query execution times, we can conclude that\nmap-side merge joins are well suited for processing SPARQL\nBGPs with MapReduce.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nIn terms of mere query performance, RDF-3X [19] has\nestablished itself as the state-of-the-art “benchmark engine\nfor single place machines. However, its performance has been\nshown to degrade for queries with unbound objects and low\nselectivity factors [5]. Furthermore, with the ever increasing\namount of available RDF data single machine solutions for\nquery processing become more and more challenging [4].\nThus, a number of systems that focus on distributed execution\nof SPARQL queries have been proposed in recent years\n\(e.g. [20], [21 22 synergy effects by reusing already deployed frame-\nworks. Our research is driven by the idea to reuse 


existing\ninfrastructures for “Big Data” scenarios. Consequently, we\nhave ensured that no changes to the underlying Hadoop\nframework are required to run our SPARQL BGP engine. This\nway, existing Hadoop clusters or cloud services \(e.g. Amazon\nEC2 driver for\nthe performance of SPARQL BGP evaluation, and thus we\nhave focused on join processing in MapReduce in this paper.\nThis topic has already been studied considering various aspects\nand application ?elds [23 24], [13], [25], [26]. In [25] the\nauthors discussed how to process arbitrary joins \(? joins using\nMapReduce, whereas [23] focuses on optimizing n-way joins.\n? joins are not required for the evaluation of SPARQL BGPs,\nand they are not supported by our solution. The execution\nof n-way joins is a generalization of our 2-way join, where\ninstead of two all n pre-sorted input partitions are processed\nin a single map phase Map-Reduce-Merge [26] describes a\nmodi?ed MapReduce work?ow by adding a merge phase after\nthe reduce phase whereas Map-Join-Reduce [24] proposes\na join phase in between the map and reduce phase. Both\ntechniques attempt to improve the support for joins in MapRe-\nduce but require profound modi?cations to the MapReduce\nframework. In [27] the authors present non-invasive index and\njoin techniques for SQL processing in MapReduce that also\nreduce the amount of shuf?ed data at the cost of an additional\nco-partitioning and indexing phase at load time. However, the\nschema and workload is assumed to be known in advance\n637\nwhich is typically feasible for relational data but does not hold\nfor RDF in general. HadoopDB [28] is a hybrid of MapReduce\nand DBMS where MapReduce is the communication layer\nabove multiple single node DBMS. The authors in 4] adopt\nthis hybrid approach for the Semantic Web using RDF-3X.\nInitially, they partition the graph on a single machine in a\nloading phase. We also initially store the dataset wrt. different\nsort orders but we employ the MapReduce framework to par-\ntition the dataset at loading time. Common to both approaches\nis that data has to be reloaded in case of updates, while we do\nnot require the installation of additonal engines at each cluster\nnode. HadoopRDF [5] is a MapReduce based RDF system\nthat stores data directly in HDFS and does also not require\nany changes to the Hadoop framework. It is able to rebalance\nautomatically when cluster size changes but join processing\nis also done in the reduce phase. As already mentioned, our\njoin processing is done in the map phase and additionally\nwe reduce the amount of data sent over the network by pro-\nactively ltering dangling tuples using bloom ?lters.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn the area of “Big Data” applications MapReduce has\nbecome a state-of-the-art technology for large-scale data pro-\ncessing. On the other side, the advent of the Semantic Web pro-\nmotes the growing adoption of RDF and SPARQL as its core\ntechnologies, raising attention for distributed SPARQL query\nprocessing in current research. As basic graph patterns, which\nare at the core of SPARQL, translate to the computation of\njoins on the operator level, ef?cient distributed join techniques\nfor RDF are of particular interest. The ?xed ternary structure\nof RDF makes it a well suited candidate for sort-merge joins\nas presorting the data is affordable. In this paper we presented\nan adaptation of sort-merge joins for SPARQL basic graph\npatterns with MapReduce which supports both 2-way and n-\nway joins The actual join computation is completely done\nin the map phase, complemented by bloom ?lters to discard\ndangling intermediate results, while the reduce phase is used\nto post-process the join output for subsequent join iterations.\nOur experiments with the LUBM bechmark demonstrated an\naverage performance bene?t between 15% and 48% of our\napproach compared to other MapReduce based systems while\nscaling smoothly with the dataset size. For future work, we\nwill consider re?nements of the data placement strategy to\nfurther optimize data locality as well as techniques to handle\ndata skew in parallel joins.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Schiff \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Towards Model-Based Control in Neural Engineering \n \nAbstract: Since the 1950s, we have developed mature theories of modern control the-\nory and computational neuroscience with little interaction between these disciplines. \nWith the advent of computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques n\(developed in robotics and weather prediction increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety \nnormal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for synergistic interaction between these fields are \nnow strong. I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
