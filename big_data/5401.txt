A WSRF-enabled Distributed Data Mining Approach To Association Rules WEKA4WS -Based  Zheng Shi-ming 1 Yang Jun-Qiang 2 Song Zi-ling 1 Miao Zhuang 1  1  Institute of Command Automation , PLA University of Science and Technology ,Nanjing 2 Xiêan Communication academy of PLA ,Xiêan, China zhengshimingnanjing@126.com  Abstract  As a latest member in distributed computing technology family, the grid computing can play an increasingly important role with the progress of the DDM\(Distributed Data Mining\ technology in recent years. However, conventional data mining is not satisfied with the requirement due to the heterogeneous and distributed of the datasets. Grid computing emerged as an important new field of distributed computing, which could support for distributed knowledge discovery applications. This paper has a try at combing the grid with web service in order to solve the problem of distributed association rules mining based on the research for the matrix theory, and achieves the distributed association rules algorithm by dint of Weka Library, presents a fast distributed association rules algorithm matrix-based ,and also proves the correctness of the algorithm in theory Finally it verifies the validity of the algorithm and the feasibility of the architecture with the distributed association rules based on WEKA4WS. This effective and fast algorithm shows sound extension, short time complexity, space complexity and small communication cost. To eva luate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, a performance analysis of Weka4WS for executing distributed data mining tasks in different network scenarios are presented 1. Introduction With the rapid development of information technology, massive data collections in terabyte and petabyte scale located on geographically distributed sites need to be maintained and analyzed in many areas such as scientific, commercial, financial, and so on The conventional technology used for data mining is incapable of dealing with this problem. So a new distributed computing  model should be found, the grid technology can satisfy  the requirement 1 The appearance of grid and web service bring a new chance for distributed data mining. Owing to the grid technology can link the different structural resources which are distributed in different places together, and a new platform which has super computing power is formed. Therefore, the computing resources, memory resources, algorithms resources, information resources and so on can be shared. As a new web applying mode and distributed computing model, web service can be used to solve all kinds of cooperating problem between different structural resources. So it is a new try to make use of the net technology fo r distributed data mining 2][4 This paper puts forward a completely new distributed mining algorith m for matrix association rules WEKA4WS-Based  in grid, its advantage is save time, it only need scan the database which distributed in each node once and need not generate candidates and frequent item sets. This algorithmic could find the maximum frequent item sets which meet the minimum support in short time through the operation of vector and matrix 2. Concepts of weka4ws and WSRF Weka4WS is a an open-source framework developed by the University of Calabria to extend the widely used Weka toolkit for supporting distributed data mining on Grid environments .Weka provides a large collection of machine learning algorithms written in Java for data pre-processing, classification clustering, association rules, and visualization, which can be invoked through a common graphical user interface 5 In Weka, the overall data mining process takes place on a single machine, since the algorithms can be executed only locally The goal of Weka4WS is to extend Weka to support remote execution of data mining algorithms through WSRF Web Services. In this way, distributed data mining tasks can be concurrently executed on decentralized Grid nodes by exploiting data distribution and improving application performance. In Weka4WS, the data mining algorithms for classification, clustering and association rules can be also executed on remote Grid resources. To enable remote invocation, all the data mining algorithms provided by the Weka library are exposed as a Web Service, which can be easily deployed on the available Grid nodes. Thus, Weka4WS also extends the Weka GUI to enable the invocation of the data mining algorithms that are exposed as Web Services on remote Grid nodes 212 ___________________________________ 978-1-42446359 6 10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE  


To achieve integration and interoperability with standard Grid environments, Weka4WS has been designed by using the Web Services Resource Framework \(WSRF\ as enabling technology. In particular, Weka4WS has been developed by using the WSRF Java library provided by Globus Toolkit 4.0.x GT4\ the Weka4WS framework all nodes use the GT4 services for standard Grid functionalities, such as security and data management WSRF 6 Web Service Resource Framework\as born as the production of Grid computing and web services combination, which is a family of technical specification concerned with the resource properties addressing, service group, and lifetime management of state resources. WSRF codifies the relationship between stateless web services and state resources in terms of the implied resource pattern, which gives the definition of the WS-Resource. WSRF describes the WS-Resource definition and association with the description of a Web Service interface, and describes how to make the properties of a WS-Resource accessible through a Web Service interface 3.

A Fast Distributed Matrix Association Rules Mining Algorithm weka4ws-based FDMAR Association rule mining is compartmentalized into two sub-questions 1\d all frequent sets in the data sets D : the frequent of each item must at least as big as scheduled minimum support 2\erate association rule according to the frequent itemsets: the rules must at least as big as the minimum support and minimum confidence In this algorithm we can get a matrix made up of 0 and 1 by scanning the database only once , and then compute the inner product of vectors 5.1 Reasoning and Proving for Fast Distributed Matrix Association Rules Traditional distributed algorithms need to generate and the judge frequent ittemsets in every local node but in grid environment the distributed matrix association rules algorithm based on weka4ws need to scan the database only once and provide every local matrix parameter , need not carry out local judgement 9 Because of the number of transactions included in the database on every local node may be different, the size of Boolean matrix that causes to generate is not uniform \( the number of row in matrix mainly\ every local node transmits the parameter of the matrix that is not uniform to global node, it can bring great trouble to the later handling. We have solved this problem with a kind of ingenious handling in algorithm, carried out illation for theory of model 214

Conclusion  Association rule mining is a very important problem in the field of data mining. This paper puts forward a new distributed mining algorithm for matrix association rules WEKA4WS-Based in grid environment , and embed it in WeKa4WS frame. It is excellent that it can reduce the times of accessing database and need not to generate candidate item sets based on Boolean matrix for Apriori algorithm need to generate plenty of candidate itemsets 12 The new algorithm need to scan the database only once and as the structure of the Boolean matrix is simple, it can be understood easily, and it is easy to compute without generating plenty of candidate item sets. It is specially important that this paper combines the grid with web service technology, builds the distributed data mining system under the grid environment, and also proves the validity of algorithms and feasibility of system.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
