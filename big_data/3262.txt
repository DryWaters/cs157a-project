Introduction  Automotive industry uses mass production techniques in order to decrease labor costs and increase the rate of production. However, mass production fails to sufficiently reflect pers onalized customer needs and demands to the final products because it produces identical items. Customiza tion according to different user needs may be only achieved by the application of different finishes and decorations to the end production line. The use of a family of computer-aided manufacturing systems has been introduced, known as mass customization in order to provide more product individuality keeping the advantages of mass producti   In this paper we present such a mass customization system, designed as an agentoriented architecture. Our framework applies a set of data mining \(DM techniques on data from automotive industry customer surveys in order to generate a set of business rules that describe the associations between the various user preferences about the design elements of vehicles. The extracted knowledge is integrated into the businesslogic component of an agent that represents the automotive industry. The goal of this agent is to provide a set of recommendations to customers based on DM results and to seek for their feedback Customers who are represented by personal agents evaluate the proposed recommendations. Their feedback is sent to a rule refinement mechanism whose purpose is to improve the generated recommendations The generated rules reflect user preferences about design attributes of various vehicle parts. These rules are taken into account in the vehicle design and manufacturing process In the following Section we present related work Section 3 describes the agen t-oriented architecture of our mass customization system and Section 4 outlines the elements of the DM mech anism that interacts with the agent framework. In Section 5 we present preliminary results derived from the application of DM techniques on customer surveys. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work  2. Related Work  Related work includes agent-based frameworks and DM techniques for mass customization in the automotive industry. Today only a few automotive industries have deployed mass customization systems in their product design and manufacturing process None of them combines agents and DM technologies for mass customization of vehicles For our purposes, the DM technique which was deemed more suitable for our needs is the associative classification AC\. This technique integrates association rule discovery and classification. Recently many associative classifica tion algorithms have been proposed. These include: CBA C P AR 3  C M AR     M C AR 5 and ADT [6 am ongst ot hers. The AC  approach could be divided into four main steps: a

discovery of all frequent rules, b\ion of all classification associative rules above the minimum confidence threshold, c\ection of one subset of class association rules to fo rm a classifier, and finally d\ measuring the quality of the derived classifier on test data Many AC algorithms have integrated the A priori  association rule discovery for discovering frequent rules in data Ot her popul ar approaches are t h e greedy strategy  and t h e FP–growth algorithm   In our implementation, we have deployed the Tertius  algorithm   Tertius as opposed to A priori  discovers first-order logic rules. It uses a top-down best-first search, which produces shorter and more general rules in the beginning and refines them later using subsumption The selection of a subset of class association rules to form the classifier is basically accomplished by the application of pruning techniques. Several AC algorithms use t h e dat a base coverage as t h ei r basic pruning technique. Other algorithms use pessimistic error estimation or lazy pruning techniques  In our work we have adopt ed dat a base coverage, since it generates simpler and more accurate classifiers Class attribute prediction mechanisms, which are based on association rules, are divided into two main groups   a t h e fi rst one conduct s predi c t i on based on the highest precedence rule and b\one takes into account multiple rules. In our framework we have adopted the first approach as it is considered to be an effective and simple technique that avoids conflicts and rule dependency issues. Amongst the different approaches for the classi fier evaluation, commonly used techniques include error rate and precision-recall In this paper we have used overall error on test data as a measure for evaluating the predictive strength of the generated classifier  3. The Agent-Oriented Architecture  Figure 1 illustrates the abstract functional architecture of the mass customization framework. The agents reside on the multi-agent system \(MAS\which interacts with a\e users via an appropriate user interface, and b\ponent. The latter applies AC techniques on user survey data, stored in an appropriate database \(DB\. The MAS includes the following agent types  User agents UA\These agents operate as user representatives that are c onstantly aware of user profile data \(e.g. age, nationality, gender, etc.\d user preferences about specific vehicle parts \(e.g seat color or texture\ndividual user is represented by one UA  Recommender agent RA by a UA\ for recommendations, based on a specific user profile and a corresponding set of user preferences. Its role is to provide a set of recommendations that best fulfill the requesting customer’s profile and preferences. In order to provide the requested recommendations, RA incorporates a rule base generated by the application of DM techniques on user survey data  Evaluator agent EA\e a user interacts with the UA, the EA is notified about user preferences and, based on them, it performs evaluation of the recommendations that RA provides. New incoming user preferences are also included into the customer survey DB to be used in the next scheduled rule refinement process The rule refinement process, as well as the steps that are required for the generation of the rule base, are described in the following Section  4. The Data Mining Component  The DM component implements an associative classifier. Its structure is de picted in Figure 2. The core elements of the DM component, enumerated as 1-4 in Figure 2, represent one step of the required procedure for the implementation of an associative classifier This classifier will produce a rule base for the prediction of the customer needs to be taken into account in the automotive design strategy The general steps for the implementation of an associative classifier are the following [10  1  All frequent rules are discovered    Figure 1.

2  Associative classification rules are selected amongst the rules produced in the previous step The most popular technique applied for this purpose is pruning. The rules that remain after the application of pruning, posses a minimum required confidence level 3  One subset of class associ ation rules is selected to form an appropriate classifier, based on the rules in step 2 4  The quality of the derived classifier is assessed by the use of testing data In the remaining section we describe each one of the separate elements of the DM component that implement as a whole the integrated associative classifier  4.1. Discovery of Association Rules  The first element of the DM component deals with the extraction of the initial set of association rules based on a training dataset from the user survey DB For this purpose, it applies the Tertius algorithm  for association rules extrac tion. This search algorithm results in shorter and more general rules. The rule discovery process is initialized by an empty rule base and proceeds by refining th e discovered rules in an iterative fashion  4.2. Pruning Redundant Rules  As soon as the association rules are extracted subsection 4.1\ar e received by the pruning element \(Figure 2.2\ent applies a pruning method in order to extract from the previous rule base those rules that are either redundant or misleading and it finally excludes them. In this way, it prevents those rules to influence in any way the final prediction process Amongst the various pruning methods proposed in the literature \(Section 2 e database coverage method  was used for our purposes, because it there is proven evid t h at i t  generat e s si m p l e r and more accurate classifiers. This method tests every rule of the generated set against the training data. If any rule is invalid for at least one record of the training set it is considered redundant and it is removed. The set of rules that remain after the pruning procedure forms the final set that passes as input to the next element  4.3. Prediction of Class Attributes  The third element of the DM component is used for the prediction of attribute values. This is realized through the application of the generated rules on the testing dataset. The algorithm adopted for the prediction of class attributes is based on the maximum confirmation value of a single rule  whi c h i s  a more flexible approach, compared to other multiple rule techniques  4.4. Evaluation  The last element that comprises the DM component is the rule evaluation element. It aims to provide evaluation of the predictive accuracy that characterizes the generated classifier. The accuracy of the classifier is measured by its capability to correctly classify test data, based on the resulted set of rules. Moreover, this element is responsible for the refinement of the existing rules in order to satisfy a required level of accuracy. Rule refinement is an iterative process which mainly involves the application of improvements on the first two steps of the AC process  5. Preliminary Results: Prediction Rules for Mass Customization of Vehicles  The original dataset used in our preliminary tests are derived from a set of 400 user surveys specifically designed in the context of an EU-funded project called CATER http://www.cater-ist.org  surveys \(however based on the same principles distributed to both truck and car drivers. Survey data were analyzed and pre-processed in order to be used for DM purposes. The expected outcome by the application of AC on user survey data was the generation of a set of rules that provide mappings between customer needs and design parameters of various vehicle parts For each individual part a separate dataset was created. Table 1 shows a snapshot of a dataset that Figure 2.

includes information about car seats. Each row represents data filled in by a separate user. For instance, the first row includes information about a male car driver from Asia, who belongs to the age range of 25-54 and believes that the main requirement for a seat is to be comfortabl e. For this user a seat that satisfies his affective needs \(i e. to be comfortable\s the one that provides “good support Table 2 includes some rules generated after the application of DM on the car seat dataset. For each rule the values of two rule-strength metrics are shown in the second and third column of Table 2. These metrics are called confirmation and support and their purpose is to measure the frequency of counterinstances. The rules shown in Table 2 have low values for the two metrics. However, the rule refinement process that requires user feedback and additional data is expected to improve the rule strength   Region Gender Age Descriptor Attribute Asia Male 25-54 comfortable good support Asia Male 55-65 cute roundish Asia Female 25-54 comfortable good support Europe Female 18-24 trendy spacious Europe Male 25-54 elegant solid Europe Male 25-54 elegant adjustable Europe Female 25-54 classic boxy Europe Male 25-54 modern solid Europe female 18-24 classic boxy Europe female 25-54 classic boxy Europe male 55-65 elegant good support Europe female 18-24 classic boxy   No Conf Support Rule 1. 0.217697 0.101761 Descr comf Attr good support  2. 0.162094 0.119374 Descr comf Attr body fitting  3. 0.158746 0.041096 Age 25-54  AND Descr comf  Attr good support  4. 0.144436 0.056751 Region Asia  AND Descr comf  Attr good support  5. 0.139820 0.052838 Gender male  AND Descr comf  Attr good support  6. 0.123784 0.015656 Gender male  AND Age 25-54  AND  Descr comf Attr good support  7. 0.123245 0.045010 Region Europe  AND Descr comf  Attr body fitting  8. 0.118928 0.048924 Gender female  AND Descr comf  Attr good support   6. Conclusions and Future Work  This paper presented an ag ent-oriented architecture for mass customization of vehicles based on the application of DM techniques on customer data Preliminary results have shown that the framework is capable of providing recommendations to the customers based on the generated rule base. However due to insufficient customer data the system has not adequately proceeded with th e rule refinement process which is expected to significantly increase the accuracy of the evaluated rules Further improvements will be also sought on the refinement process. Add itional pruning methods will be evaluated and tested. Moreover, multiple-rule prediction mechanisms will be benchmarked against the ones that rely on a single rule  References   M Tse ng a nd J Jia o  J Ma ss Customiz a tion  In  G Salvendy \(ed Handbook of Industrial Engineering Technology and Operation Management  3rd ed Wiley Interscience, 2001   B.

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

TREC ONTO p-value Macro-FM 0.388 0.386 0.862 Micro-FM 0.356 0.355 0.896 MAP 0.290 0.284 0.484 Table 1 Other Experimental results downgrade For the average macroand microF 1 Measures also shown on Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
