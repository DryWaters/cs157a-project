Maintaining Knowledge-Bases of Navigational Patterns from Streams of Navigational Sequences Ajumobi Udechukwu, Ken Barker, Reda Alhajj ADSA Lab, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Canada ajumobiu, barker, alhajj}@cpsc.ucalgary.ca Abstract In this paper we explore an alternative design goal for navigational pattern discovery in stream environments. Instead of mining based on thresholds and returning the patterns that satisfy the specified threshold\(s\, we propose to mine without thresholds 
and return all identified patterns along with their support counts in a single pass. We utilize a sliding window to capture recent navigational sequences and propose a batch-update strategy for maintaining the patterns within a sliding window. Our batch-update strategy depends on the ability to efficiently mine the navigational patterns without support thresholds. To achieve this, we have designed an efficient algorithm for mining contiguous navigational patterns without support thresholds. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the existing techniques for 
mining contiguous navigational patterns. Our experiments also show that the proposed batch-update strategy achieves considerable speed-ups compared to the existing window update strategy, which requires total re-computation of patterns within each new window Keywords Data streams, navigational patterns, webusage mining 1. Introduction An interesting problem in web usage mining that has attracted the attention of several researchers is the discovery of traversal patterns \(or link navigation 
patterns\of Tracking user-browsing habits provides useful information for service providers and businesses, and ultimately should help to improve the effectiveness of the service provided. In popular e-commerce sites, the web logs receive continuous streams of entries. For these web sites to improve their performance by utilizing discovered navigational patterns, the navigational sequences should be treated as data streams. In this work, we propose a framework for mining and updating contiguous navigational patterns from streams of 
navigational sequences. We utilize a sliding window to capture the most recent set of navigational patterns The class of patterns identified from streaming web log sequences in this work is contiguous navigational patterns. We assume pre-processing steps are applied  to the stream  of navigational sequences. Generally, there are two broad techniques for mining navigational patterns level-wise, apriori-based  s are derived from early algorithms for mining sequential 
patterns and association rules. These algorithms are level-wise and utilize candidate generation and test techniques so it is possible to define various test conditions for candidate patterns before they are included in the result-set. These algorithms can be used to discover different types of navigational patterns by adjusting the test conditions, so they can be used for mining generalized navigational patterns and for constrained navigational patterns. For example given the navigational sequence \(A, C, K, M, O, R representing objects \(or web pages 
order. A generalized navigational pattern would include çA, M, Ré as a valid pattern because the objects are visited in order. The test condition may also be set to constrain gaps between successive objects. If the maximum allowable gap between two consecutive objects in a pattern is 1, then pattern çA, M, R becomes invalid because the distance between èAê and Mê is 2. When such constraints are incorporated in the mining process the result is known as a constrained navigational pattern. A special case of constrained 
navigational patterns is contiguous navigational patterns, which results when the allowable gap between successive objects is set to 0 whereby no gap is allowed. The apriori-based algorithms can discover every type of navigational pattern discussed above Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMAê05 1097-8585/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


However, the candidate generation and test technique utilized in apriori-based algorithms is computationally expensive The development of tree-based techniques for association rule mining motivates the use of tree-based techniques for navigational pattern discovery [7 Unfortunately, the flexibility enjoyed in apriori-based techniques for navigational pattern mining is not transferable to their tree-based counterparts. The treebased techniques found in the literature identify all generalized paths but cannot differentiate constrained navigational patterns \(including contiguous patterns  set of constrained navigational patterns are included in the set of generalized navigational patterns. However, some application scenarios are better served by constrained or contiguous patterns. In such cases, the existing treebased algorithms cannot be used because they cannot differentiate between the different types of navigational patterns. For example, Nakagawa and  m e ndation system s based on contiguous sequential patterns perform better than those based on association or generalized sequential patterns in websites with low link connectivity, deep traversal depths, or dynamically generated content. These results support earlier results that advocate the use of constrained patterns for web page tree-based algorithm for mining contiguous navigational patterns that outperforms existing algorithms for discovering contiguous navigational patterns. We also contribute a novel batch-update strategy for maintaining current patterns from a stream of navigational sequences The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 presents our methodology for discovering and maintaining current navigational patterns within a sliding window. We present and discuss our experimental results in Section 4. Conclusions and areas of future work are discussed in Section 5 2. Related work Chen et al  propose algorithm s for m i ning maximal forward references from navigational patterns. The authors also propose apriori-based algorithms for mining frequent, contiguous navigational patterns from the set of maximal forward references. Our work also involves mining contiguous navigational patterns but we utilize a more efficient tree-based algorithm for this purpose. We are interested in streams of navigational sequences but not static collections of sequences. Our approach also does not require pre-defined support thresholds Pei et al  mining web navigational patterns termed the WAPtree. The authors show that the WAP-tree outperforms the earlier apriori-based techniques. However, the WAP-tree and its variants \(e.g., the PLWAP-tree cannot differentiate all the different types of navigational patterns that can be mined with the apriori-based algorithms. The WAP-tree and its variants are also driven by support thresholds. Our work differs significantly from the WAP-tree and its variants as we do not address the same problem. Our approach is directed at mining contiguous navigational patterns and is not driven by support thresholds. Our work is also tailored for environments with streaming navigational sequences Giannella et al  propose a fram ework for m i ning frequent association patterns from data streams. Their work is similar in spirit to the work in this paper However, we are interested in mining constrained navigational patterns rather than association patterns We also propose an efficient incremental patternupdate strategy within sliding windows, which differs from Giannella et al s total re-computation strategy   3. Methodology Our aim is to mine and maintain contiguous navigational patterns from input streams of navigational sequences. We use a windowing technique to capture the current navigational sequences. The input stream of navigational sequences is continuous but the navigational sequences are treated in batches. For example, if the base time unit utilized is one minute, then all the navigational sequences obtained from the web log for each minute are processed together as a batch. The window is used to determine which batches participate in maintaining the set of current contiguous navigational patterns Several windowing techniques exist. For example given that the window size is four batches and the following batches of navigational sequences arrive in this order: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10 B11, & B12. We can have a windowing strategy that processes batches B1 to B4 in one window and then batches B5 to B8 next. This would mean that after processing batch B4 the system waits to accumulate batches B5 to B8 before continuing. This approach does not support the aim of real time processing in data stream environments. An alternative windowing approach would be to have a sliding window that gets Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMAê05 1097-8585/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


updated with the arrival of each batch. Using our example, that means that batches B1 to B4 are processed in the first instance. When batch B5 arrives the window becomes batches B2 to B5. This presents different challenges because we must remove pattern counts arising from batch B1 and add those from batch B5. This can be done in two ways  Start a new mining process for each new window and accumulate the patterns for the navigational sequences present in that window  Design efficient techniques for removing the impact of the batch leaving the window while adding the new batch without starting afresh Intuitively, the second approach is preferable if the window contains several batches so it would be cheaper to remove the impact of one batch on the discovered patterns than starting the entire process from scratch. Before we discuss our strategies for maintaining patterns within a window, we first discuss our algorithm for mining contiguous navigational patterns from a batch of navigational sequences 3.1. Mining contiguous navigational patterns The aim here is to find objects \(or web pages are accessed together and the navigational patterns frequently exhibited by system users. However, unlike most algorithms, our technique is not based on predefined support \(or another threshold\We reported an algorithm for mining contiguous navigational patterns based on an adapted generalized suffix tree GST that does not require support thresholds earlier 8]. However, the adapted GST algorithm cannot be used efficiently with the window maintenance scheme discussed in Section 3.2. We propose a less compact data structure termed the AC-NAP tree A ll C ontiguous N avigational A ccess P attern tree mining the contiguous patterns without pre-defined support thresholds The AC-NAP tree is a general \(not necessarily balanced 1 Each node except the root node has a symbol, a label, a count, and a last-id property. The symbol indicates the object/webpage represented by the node. The count accumulates the number of unique navigational sequences that have reached or traversed the node. The last-id holds the identifier of the last sequence to reach or traverse the node 2 The concatenation of node symbols from the root node to any internal or leaf node constitutes the nodeês label. Each node label represents a navigational path with a support count equal to the nodeês count property 3 Each node can have an arbitrary number of children, but no two paths from any node are identical so no two child-nodes of any node can have the same symbol The AC-NAP tree construction algorithm takes the set of navigational sequences with unique identifiers defined for each sequence as input. The objects \(or web pages\ are allocated unique symbols and these are used in generating the navigational sequences. The steps involved in constructing the ACNAP tree are 1 Starting with the first navigational sequence extract the suffixes of the sequence from position 1 to position n where n is the length of the sequence. For example, given that èLê, èQê, & èR are symbols used to represent objects \(or web pages\in the system, and that çLQRé is the first navigational sequence to be added to the ACNAP tree. The suffixes of the navigational sequence are çLQRé for position 1; çQRé for suffix starting at position 2; and çRé for suffix starting at position 3. When the AC-NAP tree is created, it is given a root node. When the first suffix is added to the tree, a child node is created for each item in the suffix. Each node in the tree has a node symbol Ö which is the object \(or web page\node label which is the path from the root to that node \(i.e the concatenation of all the node symbols from the root to that node, inclusive of the nodeês symbol\ulates the number of unique navigational sequences that have reached the node; and a last-id property which holds the identifier of the last suffix that reached that node. Note that suffixes inherit the unique identifiers of their parent navigational sequences. Figure 1 shows the steps in creating the base AC-NAP tree with the suffixes of the navigational sequence çLQRé. We have numbered the nodes for ease of discussion. The shaded oval is the root node while the unshaded ovals are the other nodes of the tree. Each suffix of a sequence is added to the tree starting at the root node. The suffix being added follows the path of the child node whose symbol is the same as the next item in the suffix to be added. If there is no child node from the current node that has the next item on the suffix as a node symbol, a new child node is created from the current node and the symbol is assigned as the next item on the suffix being added. Thus, no two child-nodes from the same parent node may have identical symbols. A node label is assigned to a node at creation, for example in Figure 1, the node label Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMAê05 1097-8585/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


for node 1 is çLé; the label for node 3 is çLQR the label for node 5 is çQR etc At creation, the last-id property of a new node is the same as the identifier of the navigational sequence from which the suffix is derived. The node-count property of a new node in the AC-NAP tree is set to 1 2 The remaining sequences from the set of navigational sequences are added one at a time to the AC-NAP tree. For each sequence, all its suffixes are extracted and added to the tree in order. Each suffix is added to the tree by traversing the nodes starting at the root node similar to the process used in constructing the base tree\when a suffix reaches a node, if the identifier of the suffix is different from the last-id property of the node, the node count property of the node is incremented by 1 and the last-id property is updated to the identifier of the suffix that just traversed \(or reached 3 Finally, output all node labels and counts to a database, adding a unique identifier for each pattern. The node labels are the patterns and the node counts are the support counts for the respective patterns Figure 2 shows an AC-NAP tree for the navigational sequences çLQRé, çLQRé, çLQé, and çQRé. The representation of these navigational sequences using the adapted GST algorithm is shown in Figure 3 The adapted GST accumulates patterns along edges so a stop signal suffixes end at leaf nodes. The root node in Figure 3 is the shaded oval, the internal nodes are the unshaded ovals, and the rectangles represent the leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are handled differently than internal nodes in the adapted GST technique. \(Udechukwu et al  provide a full discussion on the adapted GST algorithm.\There are two internal nodes in Figure 3, with labels çLQ and çQé, respectively. The node with label çLQé is traversed by suffixes from three sequences so pattern LQé has a count of 3. Similarly, pattern çQé has a count of 4 because its node is traversed by four sequences. Pattern çQé from Figure 3 is equivalent to node 4 in the AC-NAP tree of Figure 2. Similarly pattern çLQé of Figure 3 is the equivalent of node 2 in Figure 2. The difference between these two representations is the AC-NAP tree reports all patterns while the adapted GST algorithm collapses some patterns that can be inferred from other patterns. For example, both patterns çLé with support count of 3 and pattern çLQé with support count of 3 are reported in the AC-NAP tree but in the adapted GST representation only pattern çLQé with support count of 3 is reported because pattern çLé does not occur independently and can be inferred. Collapsing some inferable patterns \(as is the case with the adapted GST algorithm laudable attribute in some data mining scenarios However, when mining patterns independently across different windows, as is the case in this paper, it is challenging to identify and update subparts of the collapsed patterns. For example, pattern çLQé may be found in batch B1 with support count 4 using the adapted GST algorithm. Given that there was no independent occurrence of pattern çLé it can only be inferred from çLQé. Assuming that in batch B2 pattern Lé occurs independently with a count of 2, it now becomes challenging to obtain the total count of çL across the two batches because this would require searching through the patterns from batch B1 to extract the highest count for çLé. Fortunately, this challenge is addressed in the AC-NAP tree 3.2. Maintaining patterns within a window Recall that we are working with streams of navigational sequences. The navigational sequences are grouped together into batches representing sequences that arrived within a base time unit. A sliding window is used to specify which batches participate in reporting the current set of navigational patterns. Consider the example used earlier in Section 3. Given that the sliding window size is four batches and the following batches of navigational sequences arrived in order: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9 B10, B11, & B12. Our methodology mines the navigational sequences in each batch independently Thus, when batch B1 arrives, the navigational patterns in B1 are mined and stored in a database table with the following schema Current_patterns pattern-id batch-id, patternname, support-count Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMAê05 1097-8585/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

We utilize a memory-based DBMS table for this purpose. Our examples in this section are based on memory-based DBMS concepts from the MySQL 1 DBMS. The Current_patterns table within MySQL is created in main memory using the following SQL statement CREATE TABLE Current_patterns   pattern-id INT, batch-id INT, pattern-name VARCHAR, support-count INT, PRIMARY KEY \(pattern-id    ENGINE = MEMORY  Similarly, the navigational patterns from batch B2 are mined and added to the table. The batches are mined independently and added to the table until the window size is reached \(in this case, until batch B4 is processed\Table 1 shows a sample of some navigational patterns for the first window Table 1. A sample representation of patterns in a knowledgebase table Pattern-id Batch-id Patternname Support-count 1 1 LQR 20 2 1 L 50 3 1 QR 30 4 2 QLR 40 5 2 QR 5 6 3 L 15 7 3 QR 20 8 4 QR 10 9 4 LQR 5 Notice that some patterns repeat in different batches For example: pattern çQRé occurs in all the four batches with support-counts 30 for batch 1 \(i.e., B1\5 for batch B2; 20 for batch B3; and 10 for batch B4. To obtain the unique navigational patterns within a window and their corresponding occurrence frequencies, the following SQL statement is used SELECT pattern-name, SUM \(support-count FROM Current_patterns GROUP BY pattern-name  1 http://www.mysql.com At the arrival of the next batch of navigational sequences \(i.e. batch B5\window shifts its start position to batch B2. This means that patterns from batch 1 \(i.e., B1\ust be removed from the Current_patterns table. This is achieved using the following SQL statement DELETE * FROM Current_patterns    WHERE batch-id = 1 The new navigational patterns discovered from batch B5 are then added to the Current_patterns table and the entire process repeats. We call our approach for maintaining and updating patterns within a sliding window the batch-update strategy. An alternative  re-com pute the entire set of patterns for all the batches within the window for each update. Our batch-update strategy follows a simple intuition: since the patterns within a window are processed using a sliding-window protocol that involves incrementally adding and removing sequences from the window, it makes sense to incrementally update the resulting navigational patterns and knowledgebase in a similar fashion. Thus the essence of our batch-update strategy is to remove the impact of navigational sequences that are no longer in the sliding window from the knowledgebase while adding the impact of the new sequences that just arrived at the window. This update process must be achieved correctly in the most efficient way. It is important to note that the simplicity of update enjoyed in the batch-update strategy is only possible when the patterns in the individual batches are discovered without support thresholds 4. Experimental results and discussions The major focus of our experiments is the evaluation of the batch-update strategy proposed in this paper. All the experiments reported here were executed on a personal computer running Microsoft Windows XP professional edition, with a 2GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor, and 512 MB RAM. The algorithms are implemented in Java \(in the JBuilder 8 personal edition IDE\knowledgebase was stored in a MySQL DBMS. Java database connectivity is used for communication between the programs and the knowledgebase. We tested the update strategies i.e., batch update vs. total re-computation publicly available, anonymous, real-world web logs of msnbc.comé users from W e  chose to ignore single-valued navigational sequences i.e., sequences consisting of a single page visit\as Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering: Stream Data Mining and Applications \(RID E-SDMAê05 1097-8585/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


they do not capture interesting link information. We also ignored sequences with 50 events or longer, as they were more likely to be generated by web crawlers given that the average sequence length in the original dataset is 5.7 page visits/events\ental evaluations, we set the batch size to 1,000 navigational sequences, and use window sizes of 5, 10, and 20 batches per window. For each window size, we ran 10 updates to evaluate the average performance of the different update strategies. Our results are reported in Tables 2, 3, and 4 for the three window sizes respectively We compare the performance of the two updatestrategies \(i.e., batch-update vs. total re-computation using both the apriori-based algorithm ACNAP tree for mining contiguous navigational patterns within each window. \(Note: the other tree-based algorithms for discovering navi cannot differentiate contiguous navigational patterns so we do not include them in our evaluations.\e do not report any execution times for our batch-update strategy with apriori because apriori-based algorithms are extremely expensive if support thresholds are removed and our batch-update strategy requires the removal of support thresholds. The execution times reported in Tables 2 Ö 4 are the total times required to mine the patterns within each new window and update the knowledgebase. \(The knowledgebase is utilized in applications that are based on navigational patterns such as web recommendation systems, page prefetching/prediction etc plementation, we also use a stored procedure that transfers all patterns arriving at the memory-based table to a regular diskbased table such that a historical trail of patterns is maintained The results of our experiments show that our batchupdate strategy runs in \(near\e irrespective of the window size \(i.e., given that we have the same number of navigational sequences in each batch, as is the case in our experimental setup The results follow our intuitive reasoning because our batch-update strategy only computes the patterns within the new batch entering the window and re-uses the patterns already discovered in the batches previously in the window. Furthermore, the storage and representation scheme used to discover patterns means the final step of removing the impact of patterns from the batch exiting the window is also achieved at a minimal cost 5. Conclusions This paper proposes an efficient framework for discovering and maintaining navigational patterns from streaming navigational sequences. Similar to previous work we utilize a sliding window to track the set of current navigational patterns from the data stream We utilize a sliding batch-update strategy for maintaining the patterns within the sliding window This differs from the earlier approach that required a total re-computation of patterns within windows However, our methodology requires efficient patterndiscovery techniques that are not based on support thresholds. To achieve this we propose the AC-NAP tree A ll C ontiguous N avigational A ccess P attern tree\ining contiguous navigational patterns without support thresholds. Our experiments show that our batch-update strategy is practical and achieves significant speed-ups important in streaming environments. The path-mining algorithm presented in this work discovers contiguous navigational patterns An area of future work is to develop a path-mining algorithm for the general case of constrained navigational paths that would not utilize pre-defined support thresholds 6.

Related work and conclusion Mining sequential patterns has been extensively studied in data mining community since the first research work in [1]. The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

  12  Figure 32 Bottom view of dual frequency antenna tile with perforated L-band patc h in lower layer with Kuband patches  Figure 33 Layer stack with perforated L-band patch in lower layer with Ku-band patches  8  B EAM FORMING N ETWORK  A major keystone for the su ccess of phased array antenna onboard aircraft is the capability of steering the main beam in the direction of the geosta tionary satellites. This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
