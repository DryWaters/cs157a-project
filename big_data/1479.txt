Undetected suspicious individuals, hiding among \nnormal population, disguising themselves as normal people yet \nmaybe involved in terrorist activities silently. Such individuals are \ncalled sleepers and from sleeping terrorist cells. It is a very difficult \ntask to identify such individuals. Two or more individuals, who \nwant to have an interaction to participate in a suspicious activity, \nmay not have a direct link rather they may be use other individuals \nand different modes of association to establish a link between them. \nThe aim of this paper is to propose a novel idea to identify such \nindividuals/group with different association between members \nwhich may not be observed under normal circumstances.\nKeywords—component Covert Members, National Security, \nHidden Associations \nI. INTRODUCTION nArea of terrorism detection has got tremendous growth \nespecially after the incidents like September 11, 2001 United \nStates Indonesia United \nKingdom Pakistan. This field has \nattracted interest in order to increase measures for internal and \nexternal security after facing a number of incidents.  \nIt has been observed that large-scale terrorist attacks were ncoordinated by small, determined networks of individuals who \nused a number of stratagems to camouflage their identities and \nconnectivity [1]. Terrorists are normally structured in small \nhidden cells premeditated to curtail the chance of recognition \n[2,3]. Detecting such hidden terrorist networks is a difficult \nproblem in practice. These networks are small \(e.g. the \nSeptember 9/11 network consisted of 19 terrorists [16] and \nthey have limited external connectivity. Also individuals \nbelonging to a terrorist group are very difficult to detect as they \nmay be connected through different associations. In this paper \nwe propose a new model of using different databases as means \nof associations to identify such individuals which may not be \nconnected directly but they may be connected through indirect \npaths comprising of different modes of associations through \ndifferent databases.  \nOver several last years, social network analysis \(SNA technologies have been used frequently for \nfinding hidden suspicious networks. [4,5,6,7,8]. Therefore the nproblem has been viewed as a graph in which individuals are \nrepresented by graph nodes while edges any mode of \nassociation between the individuals is represented by graph \nedges.  \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows– Section 2 \ncovers overview of some contributions made is this area so far. \nThe proposed model is discussed in detail in Section 3. Section \n4 covers the challenge and limitations which are to be faced in norder to implement the proposed method. Section 5 provides \nthe summary of work done and future areas of work. \nII. RELATED LITERATURE\nAs discussed earlier, with an increasing need to handle \nterrorist threats proactively and reactively, this area has \nattracted a number of researchers.  \nNasrullah Memon et al [9 presented detection of critical \nregions in covert networks taking terrorist networks of 9/11 as \na case study. In their research they have presented the study of \nstructural cohesion which they say that was traditionally used \nonly for Social Network Analysis \(SNA numerous other application areas like \ninvestigative data mining for destabilizing terrorist networks. \nThe number of actors which if removed from a group would \nresult in the disconnection of group defines the structural \ncohesion. They have discussed several structural cohesion \nconcepts namely cliques, n-cliques n-clans and k-plex to \nconclude familiarity, robustness and reach ability within \nsubgroups of the 9/11 terrorist network.  Moreover they have \nalso proposed a methodology of detecting critical regions in \ncovet networks; removing/capturing which nodes will disrupt \nmost of the network. \nThe same researchers have made another contribution [10]. \nStudy and development of new measures, theories, \nmathematical models and algorithms to detect high value \nindividuals in terrorist networks has been discussed in this \ncontribution Some specific models and tools have also been \ndescribed and applied to a case study of 7/7 London Bombing \nto reveal their applicability to the area.   \nNasrullah Memon and David L. Hicks [11] have again \napplied new measures, theories, mathematical models and \nalgorithms to detect key players in March 11 Madrid train nbombing terrorist network.  \n978-1-4799-0048-0/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 541\nNasrullah Memon, Abdul Rasool Qureshi, Uffe Kock Wiil, \nDavid L. Hicks [12] presented area of subgroup detection in \nterrorist networks Also a novel algorithm for subgroup \ndetection has been proposed, and an implemented \ndemonstration system has been presented. The idea presented \nin this work is that discovery of the organizational structure of nterrorist networks leads investigators to terrorist cells. \nTherefore, detection of covert networks from terrorists’ data is \nimportant to terrorism investigation and prevention of future \nterrorist activity 


nAnother important contribution in the area has been made \nby Alice Paul [13] in his thesis titled “Detecting Covert \nMembers of Terrorist Networks”. Author has proposed to \nmodel a covert organization as a social network where edges \nrepresent communication between members and then \ndetermine the subset of members to remove that maximizes the \namount of communication through the key leader. Author has \npresented a mixed-integer linear program representing this \nproblem and also decomposition for this optimization problem nStructural characteristics of vertices and subsets that increase \ncommunication have also been discussed Author is of the view \nthat future work should develop his presented structural \nproperties as well as heuristics for solving this problem as \ndiscussed approaches prove impractical for larger graphs, often nrunning out of memory. \nAnother significant work published has been done by \nBelinda A. Chiera [14] in the University of South Australia. \nTheir presented work takes a first step towards determining \nhow to locate hidden terrorist networks through the novel use \nof group-based social network metrics to characterize the nfeatures of hidden networks.  \nSteve Kramer [15] developed and presented a new \ntechnique. The proposed algorithms have been implemented in \nParagon Network Analysis \(PNA is more robust to missing or erroneous \ndata as compared to earlier techniques, especially techniques \nbased on traditional centrality measures or on subgroup \nconnectivity. The presented algorithm has been claimed that it \ncan follow the changes in a terrorist cell as it shifts from a \nhidden “sleeper” state to an “active state and as a proof of \nclaim; results of tests have also been included. It has been \ndescribed that the presented software could assist the \nintelligence community by warning of impending attacks from \nhidden cells going into action. \nWith this overview of the work done in the area, a new \nmodel as a contribution is presented in the next section. \nIII. INTEGRATED GROUP DETECTOR \nThe proposed model named Integrated Group Detector has \nbeen designed and presented keeping the observation in mind \nthat it is not necessary that two individuals must be connected \nthrough only one medium, rather they can be connected \nthrough different modes which previously might have been \nignored. In our proposed model, we declare every observation \nmedium of association through which two or more individuals \nmay be associated as one layer. Our model takes the advantage \nof the work done in the area of integration of data from \nheterogeneous database sources and also from the previously \npresented approaches in the area of terrorist network detection \nwhich have been discussed in detail in the previous section. \nThe basic entity under consideration is an individual which has nbeen represented as graph node and any association between \nthe individuals represented as an edge at any level of the graph.  \nWe propose a model which consists of three layers, first \nlayer is the Association Finder layer, Second layer will be used \nto resolve the heterogeneities of the source data bases and the nfinal layer is the data layer containing all the heterogeneous \ndata sources. \n \nFig 1: Proposed Architecture nThe model is flexible as far as the number of data sources is \nconcerned, which means that new data sources can be added to \nthe existing model only by having an associated layer in the \nheterogeneity resolver layer nFrom whole population of individuals, identify a set of \nsuspicious individuals P consisting of n members applying a \npredefined criteria. For example, emails content can be \nchecked for the presence of certain predefined words \(that have \nbeen defined as words of interest and receivers of that specific email can be \nadded to P. \nIterate on all members of P, check each against every \navailable data source for its linked individuals. Pi and Pj will \nbe considered connected if in any data source they have a link, \ne.g. if Pi has exchanged an email with Pj or Pi has sent an SMS \nto Pj or Pi has transferred an amount to Pj and so forth.  \nModel all identified individuals and their association in a ngraph consisting of individuals present in set P as nodes and \nassociation which may be from different data sources as edges. \nResults can be visualized using social network analysis \ntechniques like one presented by Bin Zhu, Stephanie Watts, \nHsinchun Chen [17]. \nApply graph theory to find hidden associations at different nlayers \(data sources Zengbin Zhang, \nTianyin Xu [18] may be applied. Also Wenfei Fan [19] graph \npattern matching technique can be applied. For the purpose of \nanalysis of sleeper cells any tool as presented by David Combe, \nChristine Largeron, Eod Egyed Zsigmond and Mathias Géry \n[20].  \n \nAssociation Finder \nHeterogeneity Resolver \nData Source \n542\n Fig 2: Integrated Group Detector System Architecture \nIV. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS \nThe Integrated Group Detector has been implemented using \nMicrosoft Visual C# and tested against publically available \nNoor Din Terrorist Network which consists of several different \nlayers like organization classmates, communication, kinship, \ntraining, business and finance, operations, friendship, religious, \nsoul mates, logistical places, logistics functions and meetings.   \nThe dataset consisted of 79 individuals i.e. 79 nodes. When \ngroup was created using single layer at a time, the structure \nobtained was totally incomplete missing very important links. \nThis can be misleading especially when data is of so sensitive \nnature. When 


all layers were used a complete picture of the \nnetwork was obtained.  \nV. LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES \nAs the data sources which are planned to be used as layers \nof interest vary in different formats and technologies so nintegration is a challenge.  \nAlso privacy of personal data is again an issue that needs to \nbe resolved in order to implement the proposed model.  \nAfter identifying associations and after modeling them in \ngraph applying graph operations is also a very complex \nproblem especially when nodes and edges under operation are nlarge in number. In our identified problem, number of nodes \ncan be in millions, so complexity is again a big challenge in the \nimplementation.  \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nNational Security has become a big challenge of the 21st ncentury.  In this paper we have presented a model which will \nallow for detecting of individuals/group with different \nassociation between them which may not be observed under \nnormal circumstances. The model is multi-layered which will \ncheck for associations at all the different layers. Such a model \nwill be computationally very expensive as it will need to check \nfor associations at each level. One future area that can be \nlooked into is implementing such a system on either grid or on \nparallel machines. By distributing the work load, the model \nwill become such less computationally expensive. \nREFERENCES \n[1]. Martonosi et al, “A new framework for network disruption” 2011. \n[2]. Kathleen M.

is\ndone through various Components’ implementations of the\nCommandHandler interface.\nThe doCycle operation of the Periodic interface is the mecha-\nnism by which a periodic thread is given the CPU each period\n- also an operational activity. In Aquarius FSW, the science\nmanager Component provides an implementation of Periodic\nupon which doCycle is called at 100Hz to perform science\ndata management.\nFigure 4 helps in understanding how polymorphism and\nsubstitutability are again used to achieve significant changes\nin FSW behavior by swapping out an old version of a\nComponent for a new version. The class ComponentX in\nthis figure represents a typical Component. Note that it is\nderived from the abstract Component base class, the same\none that appeared in Figure 3. All of the functionality of\nthe initial version of ComponentX is implemented in the\nclass ComponentX, represented in the figure by the virtual\nfunctions operation1  operation3 getVersion suppose at some time during the\nmission, a change is required in the behavior of existing\nfunctionality of ComponentX, as well as the addition of some\nnew behavior. These changes are accomplished by defining\na new class, ComponentXV2, in which only operation2 thus, the code of the other two operations are\nreused, unchanged  new functionality. The in-\nstantiated new version of ComponentX, an instance of class\nFigure 4. The inheritance pattern of Components.\nComponentXV2, thus contains code both old and new. This\nmeans that it is only necessary to upload the new code \(the\nimplementations of the functions of ComponentXV2 code that is already part of the FSW.\nDesign for Reuse\nThere is a tendency to think of reuse as being important only\nin a multi-mission sense. As important as reuse between mis-\nsions is, reuse internally, within the same software subsystem,\nhas important benefits. But reuse on any level doesn’t just\nhappen; it has to be designed for by carefully separating the\ngeneral from the specific, layering the software to separate the\nconcerns of each. Designing for reuse forces the definition\nof minimal and clear interfaces. Internal reuse avoids doing\nthe same thing in multiple ways, decreasing the possibility\nof errors, and increasing the value of time spent testing. To\nachieve higher reuse, Aquarius FSW is divided at the root\nsource-code level into two parts: a framework, which is not\nAquarius-specific; and the Components’ source code, which\ntend to be highly Aquarius-specific.\nThe framework part of the code provides the skeleton of a\nsolution for common but important tasks. To name the most\nimportant ones:\n1 Components of the FSW\n2 definition of Component classes and specific UML interfaces implementing the data flows shown in Figure\n2.\n3 Managing Components: instantiating, connecting, discon-\nnecting, and finalizing them\n4 small number of key operating sys-\ntem capabilities, including queues, threads, and semaphores.\nThese wrappers lend the using code OS and platform inde-\npendence, for the supported platform and OS configurations.\nThe code for the Components tends to be highly mission-\nspecific. For example, one Component embodies all knowl-\nedge of the radiometer that is contained in the FSW, and is re-\nsponsible for the management of the radiometer including all\ncommand & control, monitoring, and science data collection.\nAnother Component is responsible for all interfaces between\nthe FSW and the communications board. These functions are\ngenerally highly specific to Aquarius.\n4. TECHNIQUES & PROCESSES\nThe Use of UML\nThe Unified Modeling Language \(UML tech-\nnology for Object-Oriented design in general, and for Com-\nponent architecture as well. UML was made for expressing\nOO-based architecture and design, and the concept of Com-\nponent is contained in UML and is fairly well developed.\nWe found the use of UML highly effective for the following\nactivities:\n1 of the FSW, including describing the\ncontext in which the FSW operates, and a high-level descrip-\ntion of the requirements\n2 Components\nand interfaces between them\n4 diagrams such as State Machines, Activities, and\nCommunication Diagrams.\n5 tool we used generates\nthe declarations of classes and operations in C++. It also is\nable to read C++ header files and build or refine a model from\nthem.\n6 at generating and round-tripping in Java, which we used\nfor test tools.\nDesign Process: Defining the Components\nOne very key activity in architecting a Component-based\nsoftware system is defining the components and the inter-\nfaces among them. We found an effective procedure for\naccomplishing this. The most directly applicable of our\npreviously-listed architectural guiding principles here is part\nof 2 minimality of interactions among parts of\n6\nthe FSW. This implies finding a decomposition of logical\nresponsibilities into Components that results in the least and\nsimplest possible communication among them.\nUsing a white board, and the kind of diagrams shown in Fig-\nure 2, it is easy to try out various 


candidate decompositions\nof the FSW into Components, sketching out the data flows\nthem. Reducing the number and complexity of data flows\nin each candidate decomposition informs the decision among\nthe alternatives.\nAnother key guiding principle we identified in defining the\nComponent decomposition is that the software should follow\nthe physical modularity of the hardware. In Aquarius, there\nwere three custom-made circuit boards with which the FSW\nhad a direct interface. We wanted to be able to test in configu-\nrations in which any combination of those three boards being\npresent or not present could occur.\nIf a particular board is not present, it needs to be simulated\nin software, and this is easily accomplished by creating a\nsimulation version of the Component or Components that\nimplement the interface to that board. Clearly, if a single\nComponent has a direct interface to more than one board, then\nit’s quite difficult to accommodate having one or the other\nof the boards, but not both, in the software. Also, the ease\nof substituting just one Component to simulate a non-present\nboard is better than substituting multiple ones; thus, it’s best if\nthere is one software Component for each discrete, removable\nhardware piece.\nAgain refering to Figure 4, the simulation version of Com-\nponentX is implemented as the class ComponentXSim. Note\nthat, because that class is derived from the ComponentX base\nclass, the simulation version can exercise much of the flight\ncode, which resides in the ComponentX class.\nHaving identified the Components and the data flows between\nthem, the next step is to convert the data flows into actual\nUML Interfaces, with function signature definitions. This\nstep includes making decisions about whether a given inter-\nface operation is synchronous or asynchronous, and whether\ndata is pushed or pulled.\nRefer again to the simple runtime diagram of Figure 2. The\nComponent instances and data flows shown in that diagram\nhave been converted into specific classes and interfaces in\nthe diagram of Figure 5. For example, the data flow labeled\n”msg” going from the CommBoardCmp object at the top of\nFigure 2 to the CommandCmp is shown to be implemented, in\nFigure 5, as the interface MessageSink, and its being provided\nby the CommandCmp, and used by the CommBoardCmp.\nIn the model, the MessageSink interface has a single opera-\ntion in it: acceptMessage this is not shown in any of the\ndiagrams in this paper model, the header file for\nthe code of interface MessageSink can be generated by the\nUML tool.\nThe Use of C++\nThere has been much debate in the FSW community about\nthe relative benefits and suitability of C versus C++ for FSW.\nC has been the dominant FSW language in our institution.\nAmong the concerns about using C++ for FSW are:\n1 Performance.\nBefore discussion each of these, we need to describe our\nrestrictions on the use of C++ for Aquarius FSW. We use the\nfull C++ language with the following exclusions:\n1 Information \(RTTI linking more complex, executables larger,\nand significantly complicates pointer logic.\n2 handling \(try, throw, catch or virtual inheritance. This feature can\ncause virtual functions to run slightly slower, and it implies\nthe use of RTTI.\n4 tremendously increase the size of\nthe image, and are not really required in FSW anyway.\n5 of templates. We do allow templates,\nbut sparingly. This avoids code bloat.\nThese restrictions on the language make it possible to avoid\nrealizing the concerns outlined above. We avoid code bloat by\ncarefully using templates, and by avoiding unneeded library\nfeatures and RTTI. We avoid hidden memory allocation by\navoiding exception handling, and also by an educated and\ncareful use of Standard Template Library \(STL container\ntemplates, i.e. by allocating memory for these containers\nup front, and knowing how to use them so that they do not\nallocate memory thereafter.\nThe complexity argument, we find, is a combination of\nunfamiliarity with OO concepts and ways of thinking, as well\nas a reaction to indeed overly-complex use of inheritance\nand template usage, often perpetrated by new users of C++.\nAquarius’ FSW design and code has been presented and\nreviewed extensively, and our experience tells us that it is not\nmore complicated than other FSW designs of similar size.\nAnd finally performance: The ISO Technical Report on C++\nPerformance \(see [3 thoroughly examines the performance\nof C++ in every aspect of execution, and concludes that C++\nis in some respects \(e.g. virtual functions in a multiple-\ninheritance hierarchy in\nmany respects no different at all. Our experience agrees.\nAquarius FSW has quite demanding performance require-\nments, among them handling interrupts at rates in excess of\n100Hz while sending downlink data at 1/2 MB/second, which\nit meets easily.\n5. THE USEFULNESS OF PLUG & PLAY\nCOMPONENTS\nTo date, the run-time modification capability has been ex-\ntremely useful in flight as well as testing situations. It has\nallowed lower-risk and quicker problem fixes in flight and\nin integration and thermal testing. It has enabled tests on a\nsystem level that would normally be possible only in white-\nbox context, allowed rapidly prototyping design modifica-\ntions and problem fixes, and served other utility purposes.\n7\nFigure 6. The class model of the 


EEPROM Writer Component.\nFollowing is a brief discussion of some of the applications of\nthis capability.\n1 Fixing problems after the flight instrument had been as-\nsembled: In integration testing with the flight Radiometer,\na minor FSW bug was found \(not copying a status word\nfrom the instrument into the science header Later still,\na deficiency in the design for reporting of radio frequency\ninterference was detected, which had to be fixed by using\nsome spare words in the science block for additional RFI\nstatus bits. However overwriting the EEPROMs at that late\ndate was judged too risky, and the decision was made to fix\nthese problems by uplinking modified components. This was\ndone in flight after the instrument was originally turned on.\nThese fixes together required uplinking modified versions of\nthree Components.\n2 Late in the development, we\nrealized that writing the EEPROMs using a patch instead of\nthe traditional serial port-based EEPROM writing application\nwould save us from having to modify the flight hardware con-\nfiguration to enable the serial port if we wanted to write the\nEEPROMs after the flight system had been assembled This\nwould also open the possibility of writing the EEPROMs in\nflight, though this is not planned EEPROM Writer\ncomponent was developed to write a flight software image to\neither \(or both EEPROMs. This com-\nponent is not part of the original flight software component\nconfiguration. It is itself uploaded as a new flight software\npatch. There are two on-board EEPROMs; one on the CPU\nboard and the other on communications board. The EEPROM\nWriter component is capable of writing to and verifying of\neither EEPROM selected via ground command. The EEP-\nROM Writer component, of class EepromCmp, consists of an\nEepWriter, and CmdHandler classes, as shown in Figure 6.\nDuring the connection process, the installCommandHandlers\nmethod registers all the new ground commands needed for\nuplinking a complete FSW image, with unique op-codes\nand their associated command parsers. The scheduleTasks\nmethod adds the EepWriter object to the schedule as a new\nperiodic task with pre-selected priority. The EEPROM writes\nmust be timed carefully, and this Periodic runs at 100 Hz to\naccomplish this. Once installed, the EepWriters CmdHandler\nobject wakes up on a series of ground commands to upload\na new flight image. The image is written to one of the EEP-\nROMs in chunks during periodic calls from the Scheduler to\nthe EepWriter.\n3 sole\npurpose is to waste CPU time at a high priority, and to\nprogressively use more of it as time goes on. We want to\nmake sure that the performance of the FSW degrades in a\npredictable way. This patch is called the CpuHog.\n4 try it out before\nchanging the baseline and overwriting the EEPROM, so we\nmade a patch of the component that contains the driver. After\ndebugging the driver, we decided to incorporate the new\ndesign into the baseline.\n5 analog accu-\nmulation register because the board required more time than\nits specification said it did. We made the modifications\nnecessary in a patch of the component that contains the\ninterface to that register and, after some experimentation and\nmodifications \(over several patch uploads made it part of the baseline.\n6 driver chip became very noisy above a certain\ntemperature, and had to change the FSW to handle this which\nincluded disabling an interrupt and other changes. Under\n8\nextreme time pressure, we quickly put the fix into a patch,\ntested it, and then incorporated it into the baseline. Doing the\npatch let us test the fix in the thermal chamber before having\nto write the EEPROMs with a new edition of the FSW.\n7 system-level patching tests: we have\nseveral components that intentionally fail at different steps in\nthe patching sequence so that we can test the FSW’s response\nto these failures.\n8 a suspended task: on\none of our system test scenarios, we intentionally peek an\ninvalid address, which causes the thread that handles the peek\ncommand to get suspended. We don’t want to reboot, so we\nuplink a replacement patch for the component containing that\nthread. The finalization process of the replaced component\ndeletes the original thread, and installing the replacement\ncreates a new one. In this case, we install a new instance\nof the very same version of the component. This could avoid\na reboot in flight.\nWe believe that the effort of designing and implementing the\nComponent management framework and its application to\nAquarius FSW, as well as the additional work of thoroughly\nverifying the Component replacement logic, has been amply\nrewarded.\n6 VERIFICATION\nVerification of the FSW, both in terms of implementation of\nthe requirements and also of a high degree of reliability, takes\nplace by both analysis and by testing. Testing is preferable,\nwe resort to analysis when testing is not possible or practical.\nTesting takes place on two levels: ”black box”, system tests,\nin which only the flight data paths in and out of the FSW\nare available; and ”white box”, subsystem tests, which are\nimplemented as C++ applications which have access to the\ninternals of the parts of the software under test.\nWe spent a great deal of time writing test tools and test code;\nin fact we wrote about half again as much test code as we did\nflight code, and it was well worth it.\nAn important aid for testing: by 


wrapping OS functions\nin a C++ interface, our FSW could run on both the target\nPowerPC under VxWorks, and on the Solaris/SUN target,\nusing native Solaris Posix threads, queues, etc. Thus, we\ncould run almost any of our tests on either the workstation\nor the target.\nAutomated System Testing\nWe defined a set of scenarios at FSW-system level, using only\nthe flight interfaces: 1553 bus messages and high-speed serial\nport for science downlink. This set of scenarios was sufficient\nto verify almost all of the FSW’s requirements. \(There were\nsome requirements that had to be verified on a white-box\nlevel, and a few that could only be verified by inspection or\nanalysis this:\n• Command Tool: reads command dictionary, processes\nscripts with commands in simple English/ASCII format, with\ndelay specifications per command, converts commands to\nbinary, 1553 format commands, sends them on a socket to\nSIM version of communication board interface Component.\nCan run indefinitely, being given new scripts to process by\ncopying files into the input directory.\n• Telemetry Tool: Accepts ”1553” messages on a socket from\nthe SIM version of the comm board interface Component,\nconverts binary messages into simple ASCII format.\n• Sci Data Tool: Accepts binary science block messages on\na socket from the SIM version of the comm board interface\nComponent, converts binary messages into simple ASCII\nformat.\n• Test Executive: Reads a suite of tests, executes each one\n\(option to particular tests simultaneously or in series Command/Telemetry and SciData Tools, evaluates results\nby comparing ASCII housekeeping and science data output\nfiles with expected results files in the form of Perl regular\nexpressions.\nWith these tools, we were able to easily run long suites of test\nscenarios and quickly evaluate the results. This enabled us\nto do a comprehensive retest as often as we liked \(subject to\nthe limitation that it took many hours to run the entire set of\ntests new\none, seems risky, even though it is entirely common-place\nin ground software. But because it is not so often done in\nflight software, and because of the higher reliability needed,\nwe perceived a greater risk in doing it, and therefore paid\nspecial attention to the verification of this capability in the\nFSW.\nOne of the difficult things to verify was that there were no\nstray interactions between successive versions of a compo-\nnent. For example: if Component A did not completely\ndetach from Component B, and Component B were replaced\nwith a new version, might Component A still have an invalid\nreference to the old instance? The order of Component\nreplacement then, is meaningful. With about 10 Components\nthat can be patched, Aquarius FSW might be vulnerable to\nbugs such as this, only in specific Component replacement\norder.\nVerifying the lack of such bugs is a combinatorial problem,\nresulting from the ordering of Component replacement op-\nerations. To test this, we developed a program that gener-\nated thousands of pseudo-random sequences of Component\nreplacement operations. We ran this program frequently\nthroughout the development process. This gave us signifi-\ncantly more confidence that we had uncovered any bugs in\nthe connection/disconnection logic.\n7. FSW QUALITY\nAt JPL software defect rates are tracked on an ongoing basis\nin order to understand how well \(or not well doing in\nproducing quality software.\nMetrics are collected on all types of software: ground system\nas well as flight, and categorized by type. Defect rates are\nalso categorized by phase: development, system test and\noperations. These values for instrument flight software are\nshown in the Table 1.\nOverall, Aquarius FSW had an order of magnitude fewer\n9\nTable 1. Average instrument flight software defects per\nthousand physical lines of code, by phase\nPhase Average AQ AQ/Av\nDevelopment 1.6 .053 3.3%\nSystem Test 1.71 0.16 9.2%\nOperations 0.14 0 N/A\ndefects than the average for JPL instrument FSW projects.\nWe should note that this dataset was collected over only\nfive instrument flight software projects, so its authority is\nquestionable. But it does provide a rough metric of software\nquality.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nOne frequently-heard reaction to the plug-and-play capability\nprovided by our architecture is: That is not necessary in flight.\nAnother is: That increases risk by reducing determinism\nbecause of the dynamic connection process.\nThe first objection is not surprising After all, once the system\nis launched, it can hardly change so much that it would need\nmajor behavior modifications. This may be true, but it seems\nto us that it rarely is. Many missions, including Aquarius,\nhave had to make significant FSW changes after integration.\nMoreover, this objection misses the point that important use\ncases for the FSW happen well before launch: namely during\ndevelopment and integration, and in the continuous verifica-\ntion that \(should be plug-and-play architecture, as we have\nseen, greatly enhances the ability to do better, faster more\nflight-like testing at all phases of development.\nAnd that addresses the second objection: by improving test-\ning, this capability decreases the overall risk to the mission,\nby making the FSW better tested and thus more reliable.\nThere is only so much test time, and if the FSW is difficult\nto test because of built-in rigidity, then that degrades the\nquality and quantity of testing, and so results in a less reliable\nproduct.\n9.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
