formed distributed system consisting of individual sensing nodes which can be orbital or terrestrial in situ or remote sessile or mobile and which have the ability to communicate and exchange information Sensor Webs have been demonstrated successfully in variety of environmental sensing applications including oxygen gas sensing 1 and soil moisture sensing 2 These demonstrations have also shown how the collected information can control external systems such as sprinklers how it can handle spatio-temporal sensing and how it can increase the robustness of the sensing network Our work takes 
Sensor Webs into a new phase by making them intelligent collaborative and self-aware The intelligence is added to each sensor and allows the Sensor Web to be truly adaptive to the events in the environment it senses The Sensor Web becomes a multi-agent system  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 25102008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1295 Version 4 Updated December 6 2007 where individual sensor agents can collaborate form dynamic coalitions to handle tasks that a single sensor cannot and can negotiate in order to 
form the best set of coalitions that maximize the overall utlility of the Sensor Web Each sensor identifies tasks that it cannot perform and then uses the Contract Net protocol to ask other agents to assist it We applied our approach to some of the Earth Observing 1 EO-1 instruments and have shown that the agents can correctly form a Sensor Web that will satisfy the dynamically generated sensing and processing needs 2 SENSOR AGENT ARCHITECTURE Each sensor hosts an intelligent agent that adds to the sensor autonomous decision making The sensor 
agent3 consists of two basic components as shown in Figure 1 the Reasoning Component and the Communication Component The Communication component is responsible for receiving messages from and delivering messages to the other sensor agents in the Sensor Web The Reasoning component consists of four sub-components The event monitor snoops the data collected by the sensor and if it identifies interesting events it informs the Reasoning component While the event monitor reacts to events the task generator uses these events to 
predict future sensing requirements needs and parameters The Reasoning component decides whether the sensor can satisfy on its own the new sensing needs arising from the event by checking its own state represented by the agent state sub-component or whether it will require the assistance of other sensors In the latter case the agent generates task requests through its task component and contacts other agents that it believes can assist it These other agents will choose to respond to this request and if they 
respond they will do so through a bid The bid evaluator sub-component examines the bid and if satisfactory it awards the task to some other sensor agent After the task request bidding bid evaluation and task assignment phases the coalition of sensors is finalized and then the newly created Sensor Web proceeds with its sensing tasks Since the task scheduler allows the Sensor In this paper we will use agent and sensor agent interchangeably to indicate the intelligent agent associated with a specific sensor or sensors 1 


M capable agents 11 Web to schedule future tasks the sensing coalition may change over time since different sensors may exit and enter it as the sensing tasks and requirements change over time Sensor Agent Model and a variety of message protocols RDF was created in 1999 as a standard on top of the Extensible Markup Language XML for encoding metadata for the semantic web 6 The 2004 updated RDF standard moved beyond that and allows the encoding of ontological information about things in the world and their relationships between them 5 The RDF standard is supported by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C 7 task 42  A Ini ializatlon 5 Request fr bid 7 Contract awad K XU Match Maker AgenBt b3 Rd 63 Bid Ae Figure 1 Architecture of a sensor agent 3 SENSOR AGENT OPERATIONS The operations of our sensor agents are summarized in Figure 2 A sensor is initialized by its sensor description represented in SensorML 3 SensorML is a standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium that provides a description of sensor systems This description allows an agent to be aware of is own capabilities As the sensor senses the environment its event monitors may identify an event or set of data that necessitate additional sensing and processing tasks that cannot be performed by the sensor The sensor agent will attempt to identify the sensors that can perform these tasks by contacting a Matchmaker The Matchmaker provides the sensor agent with the names and contacts of the sensors it believes can perform the necessary tasks Next the sensor agent composes bid requests for these sensor agents and asks them to bid for the tasks When bids are submitted it evaluates them and then it awards the sensing or processing contract to the best suited sensor The process of contract award leads to the formation of a coalition of sensors that can collaborate to perform complex sensing tasks i.e it leads to the formation of a Sensor Web All agent communicative acts follow the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents FIPA and Resource Description Framework RDF standards 4 5 FIPA is an IEEE Computer Society standards organization that promotes agent-based technology and the interoperability of its standards with other technologies 4 FIPA defines among others the message parameters for multi-agent systems including the contents and semantics of a message Figure 2 Operations of a sensor agent Sensor Representation Sensors in our work are represented using a subset of SensorML 3 In our work we chose to represent some of the instruments on EO1 Specifically we represent the Advance Land Imager ALI Hyperion and LEISA/Atmospheric Corrector LAC The sensor representation is simpler than one that is possible through a complete SensorML formalism actually some of these instruments have no complete SensorML description yet and our goal was to represent the basic sensor capabilities so as to allow reasoning For example the Advanced Land Imager ALI sensor of EO-1 is a multispectral imager with a spectral range from 0.4 to 2.4 ptm ALI covers from the visible to the near infrared to the short-wave infrared spectrum and has a resolution of 30 m except for its panchromatic band that has a resolution of 10 m Our representation refers to ALI's sensing capabilities in terms of the bands resolution signal to noise ration etc plus capabilities of the vehicle such as on-board processing and storage Event Monitoring and Generation of Tasks A sensor operates in some standard mode sensing its environment processing the data and sharing some parts of it with users and other sensors At the same time the sensor agent uses event monitors to identify events of interest Events of interest are driven by the satisfaction of a logical condition involving state data4 data-driven events Data4 State data are any data that are associated with the agent or the 2 33 Request for agents wh[o ca Event Mionitoring 0.I X  r Agenit1 43harces ot per frm a 


driven events can be instantaneous and conditioned on the current values of state variables that reflect the current state of the world or continuous for example trends or averages involving those variables Continuous data-driven events require storage of previous value\(s in some form For example an event condition that checks on a running average or a trend would be classified as continuous since prior state information would have to be stored The event monitor is developed as a collection of active conditional elements that match against the state variables of the sensor For example an instantaneous event monitoring rule would be if SOIL-TEMP  1000F then ACTIVATE-AGENT indicating that if the sensed parameter soil temperature is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit the sensor agent should be activated Or if FREE-DISC-SPACE  1000 then ACTIVATE-SPRINKLER Such a rule requires that the event monitor store historical soil temperatures for at least the last 30 minutes The interesting event data are also shared with the task generator The task generator identifies which tasks cannot be satisfied by the sensor and generates task requests The Matchmaker The Matchmaker is a centralized repository of sensor agent capabilities and needs 8 When sensor agents enter the multi-agent Sensor Web environment they advertise their sensing and processing capabilities to the Matchmaker An advertisement example is given below to allow for readability we have stripped the FIPA and RDF tags and we are showing only the messages our program will print out ALI Pan Registering provided services Matchmaker:Agent ALI Pan registered urn:ogc:def:classifier:SpectrumI Visible urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI CloudSensing urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI LandSensing This Matchmaker capabilities registration message comes data it is collecting through its sensor\(s from the ALI Panchromatic sensor and indicates that it can sense in the visible spectrum and can sense clouds and land Capabilities registered with a Matchmaker are always described on a high level There are two reasons for that First detailed capabilities might change over time for example the area sensed by a mobile sensor such as one on a space vehicle Second an agent requesting a capability may be willing to settle for something worse than what it asked for for example it may like imagery with 100 m resolution but anything under 1 km resolution might be acceptable compared to no data If all capabilities were advertised in perfect detail it would become impossible to make compromises between requested and available sensor services In addition to capabilities agents may register requests with the Matchmaker A request indicates that the requesting agent is looking for others that can satisfy its needs by performing the required tasks The following is an example of a registered need Manager Requesting agents with my required services urn:ogc:def:classifier:sensorSpectrumI ACTIVATEAGENT indicating that if the sensor parameter free disc space is less than 1000 units bytes Kbytes etc the sensor agent should be activated Note that state variables can be both internal to the sensor i.e its own state tasks status and external to it e.g sensed data requests by other sensors A continuous event monitoring rule would be if SOIL-TEMP increased by 50 in 30 minutes then SWIR urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI LandSensing This message asks for help from agent\(s who can perform sensing of land using a short-wave infrared sensor When the Matchmaker receives a request for capabilities it looks at the capabilities that agents have registered with it and sends the list of capable agents to the requesting agent Contractingfor Sensing and Processing Tasks Our work is based on the seminal research on Contract Nets described in 9 and 10 In the Contract Net protocol agents request that others submit bids for completing specific tasks and then evaluate these bids to identify the most capable agent Our work adopts this approach and adapts it to the environment of Sensor Webs After one of our sensor agents has generated a task and has received from the Matchmaker a list of agents that could perform it it contacts these agents directly with a request for bids Each bid request consists of a task abstraction and a bid specification The task abstraction is a description of the task in finer level of detail than the one sent to the Matchmaker but still not completely specified since the requesting agent may need to make tradeoffs when it receives the task bids What the task abstraction indicates to the agents receiving the bid request is that if they cannot satisfy at least that requirement they should not bid The bid specification indicates the contents of the response to the bid These are the items the bid requesting agent manager will use to evaluate the submitted bid The 3 


following is an example of a bid request Manager:Sending Instrument meets task abstraction Sending bid Quality signalToNoiseRatio='GOOD Double resolution='30.0 The bid requesting agent receives bids and waits a currently predefined period of time before it starts evaluating them the waiting time is used in lieu of requiring agents to respond with a will not submit a bid message The evaluation is based on the bid specification and the bid submitting agent that meets the required specifications the closest is assigned the task contract The use of a Contract Net protocol for sensor task assignment achieves a number of goals First only sensor agents that can perform the task respond to a bid request limiting the communication overhead of the system Second by advertising general needs the requesting agent can use internal domain-specific evaluation criteria to assign the task to a sub-optimal agent but to one who can still provide a satisfactory solution this allows us to deal with over-constrained task requests that have no optimal solution Third the approach makes optimal use of the sensor network by exchanging the minimum possible number of messages and by assigning a task to the most capable and available sensor Finally the approach responds to a changing environment that requires a dynamic allocation of tasks and which leads to the formation of an adaptive intelligent Sensor Web 4 RELATED WORK Some work has started to add to Sensor Webs the ability to adapt and react to the environment For example Jain et al 11 discuss how the DeSiDeRaTa adaptive resource management strategy could be used by constellations of satellites to dynamically reconfigure their computational load Some other work has looked at changing the configuration of a sensor web using mobile sensors to improve sensing a thermocline 12 The work by Chien et al with the EO1 system showed how to dynamically configure its sensors based on user requests 13,14 There is also a lot of work making proposals of how Sensor Webs could be best used such as the proposal described in 15 Our work differs from these and many other similar efforts We implement a general intelligent adaptive and testable mechanism to form coalitions of pods that can perform sensing tasks Our approach is not specific to some particular sensing task or sensor type Our work is applicable to all Sensor Web tasks since it develops the overall Sensor Web formation methodology and individual components such as the specific event monitors or particular sensor capabilities can be changed for different types of Sensor Webs and sensors Our work touches upon the areas of event monitoring Active database systems provide event alerters triggers that notify applications of interesting data events 16 However an alert mechanism can only let an agent know about relevant changes but it does not support an agent whose information needs change due to changes in an environment as our proposed event monitoring There has been some previous work in using multi-agent systems to control suites of sensors For example Soh et al describe forming coalitions of sensors to track moving vehicles in real time 17,18 Modi et al approach a similar sensor coalition problem from the perspective of distributed resource allocation 19 while Horling et al use the Task Analysis Environmental Modeling and Simulation TAEMS language to quantitatively describe alternate ways a goal can be achieved and consequently allow alternate ways of assembling sensors in a coalition 20,2 1 This and similar work in sensor networks deals with sessile homogeneous sensors which are dedicated to a single sensing task e.g tracking vehicles and where the goal of the multi-agent architecture is to pick the best sensors for the task Our work in Sensor Webs deals with heterogeneous sensors which can be mobile and which must come together into a dynamic coalition to satisfy an a priori unkown dynamically formulated task There is work in multi-agent reconnaissance for example see 22 23 and 24 but this work focuses on task planning task coordination and task precedence and not on forming sensing coalitions of heterogeneous sensing assets Finally there are some proposals for multi-agent reconnaissance for planetary exploration but no concrete system has been deployed 25 5 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we describe how a combination of a Matchmaker and Contract Net architecture allows for the dynamic formation of Sensor Webs In our approach 4 out bid requests task abstraction Integer wavelength='1200 bid specification signal-To-NoiseRatio resolution This example bid request indicates that the bid submitting agent must be able to sense at 1200 nanometer wavelength If an agent is going to submit a bit it must indicate its signal to noise ratio and its resolution at that frequency which means that the bid requester will use these two parameters to evaluate bids before awarding the task to another sensor agent Sensor agents receiving a bid request decide if they can perform the task by looking at the task abstraction and if their requested sensing or processing capabilities are not already allocated If they can respond to a bid request they do so by submitting a bid as the one below which was sent from the Hyperion sensor agent of EO1 Hyperion 


sensors use SensorML to represent their abilities and then register these with a central capability repository the Matchmaker The sensor agents actively monitor the environment and when it is so required they post task needs with the Matchmaker These needs indicate tasks that they cannot complete on their own and for which they need the generation of a Sensor Web After the Matchmaker provides them with the agents who could satisfy these needs the agents use the Contract Net protocol to request and evaluate bids for these tasks Under this protocol agents submit bids for the completion of tasks and the bid requesting agent uses domain-specific criteria to evaluate these bids and then award task contracts thus recruiting agents to the Sensor Web In our work we used the EO-1 sensing instrument ALI Hyperion and LAC as potential sensors and have shown how the overall approach allows for the formation of a Sensor Web Future work will expand the Contract Net protocol by allowing negotiation for the use of limited constrained resources and by allowing sensors to share their resources among many requests by agents We will also compare our approach to the formation of a Sensor Web with other competing ones such as ones based on a Service Oriented Architecture 26 REFERENCES 1 Delin K and S.P Jackson 2000 Sensor Web for in situ Exploration of Gaseous Biosignatures Proc IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky MT 465-472 2 Teillet P R Gauthier G Fedosejevs M Maloley A Chichagov and G Ainsley 2003 A Soil Moisture Monitoring Sensorweb Demonstration in the Context of Integrated Earth Sensing Proc of SPIE vol 5151 Earth Observing Systems VIII William L Barnes Ed 63-73 3 Botts M ed 2002 Sensor Model Language SensorML for In-site and Remote Sensors OpenGIS Interoperability Program Report OGC 02-026 v 07 Open GIS Consortium Inc 4 FIPA 2007 Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents www.fipa.org last accessed October 20 2007 5 Lassila 0 and R Swick eds 1999 Resource Description Framework RDF Model and Syntax Specification Recommendation W3C 6 W3C 2007 www.w3.org last accessed October 21 2007 7 XML 2007 www.xml.org last accessed October 21 2007 8 Kuokka D and L Harada 1996 Integrating Information via Matchmaking J of Intelligent Information Systems vol 6 no 2-3 261-279 9 Smith R 1980 The Contract Net Protocol HighLevel Communication and Control in a Distributed Problem Solver IEEE Trans on Computers vol C29,no 12 1104-1113 10 Smith R and R Davis 1981 Frameworks for Cooperation in Distributed Problem Solving IEEE Trans on Systems Man and Cybernetics vol SMC11 no 11 61-70 11 Jain S L Welch D Chelberg Z Tan D Fleeman D Parrott D Pfarr M Liu and C Shuler 2002 Collaborative Problem Solving Agent for On-Board Real-Time Systems Int Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium 12 Zhang B G Suhkatme and A Requicha 2004 Adaptive Sampling for Marine Microorganism Monitoring IEEEIRSJ Int Conf on Intelligent Robotics and Automation 13 Chien S R Sherwood D Tran B Cichy G Rabideau et al 2005 The Autonomous Sciencecraft Embedded Systems Architecture IEEE Int Conf on Systems Man and Cybernetics Hawaii USA 14 Chien S B Cichy A Davies D Tran G Rabideau et al 2005b An Autonomous Earth Observing Sensorweb IEEE Int Conf on Systems Man and Cybernetics Hawaii USA 15 Koratkar A J Grosvenor J Jung and J Geiger 2005 Autonomous Multi-sensor Coordination The Science Goal Monitor Proc of SPIE vol 5659 293-300 16 Hanson E.N and Noronha L.X 1999 Timer-driven Database Triggers and Alerters Semantics and a Challenge SIGMOD Record vol 28 4 11-16 17 Soh L-K C Tsatsoulis and H Sevay 2003 A Satisficing Negotiated and Learning Coalition Formation Architecture in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 109-138 18 Soh L-K and C Tsatsoulis 2005 A Real-Time Negotiation Model and a Multi-Agent Sensor Network Implementation Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems vol 11 no 3 215-271 19 Modi P.J P Scerri W-M Shen and M Tambe 2003 Distributed Resource Allocation in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 219-256 20 Horling B R Mailler J Shen R Vincent and V Lesser 2003 Using Autonomy Organizational Design and Negotiation in a DSN in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 139-184 21 Horling B R Vincent R Mailler  J Shen R Becker K Rawlins and V Lesser 2001 Distributed Sensor Network for Real Time Tracking Proc of the 5th Int Conf on Autonomous Agents Montreal Canada ACM Press 417-424 22 Giovanini L J Balderud and R Katebi 2007 Autonomous and Decentralized Mission Planning for Clusters of UUVs Int J of Control 80:7 11695

This recipe for ontologizing the data is a more detailed explanation of what is shown pictorially in Figure 3 It is important to realize that essentially all that is happening in this process is that the data are being extracted through parsing and then combined with the template ontology to form an encoded output just as the figure shows The steps listed above will be discussed in further detail in the subsequent paragraphs of this section The first step in ontologizing the data was to read the ontology into the Java program In order to perform this and all other actions required to manipulating the ontology the Jena Semantic Web Framework package or Jena was used.5Jena is an open-source Java Framework that serves as a programmatic environment for RDF RDFS OWL and SPARQL while also including a rule-based inference engine ref By reading a template ontology into Jena the user can programmatically create instances populate properties perform queries or perform a myriad of other tasks on the ontology Jena served as the backbone of our program With the ontology read in and ready to accept data in Jena we now turn to combining the relevant data with the template ontology to produce the structured output as shown in Figure 3 To this end steps 2 and 3 are essentially the same as steps 4 and 5 with only the source of the information being different For football the parsing of the files was made simpler by the fact that each player and play was given its own line in their respective files and the files were simply ASCII-text written in a format that was consistent from team to team for the rosters and within a play type in the play-to-play files That is each roster was structured in exactly the same way regardless of the team and each unique type of play had the same structure within a game and between games As a result traditional parsing techniques were used to parse the files For the rosters this simply meant that Java tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used The play-by-play was understandably much more complex but was parsed with a combination of using regular expressions to match the type of play and then using built in Java functions to perform further sentence examination This same methodology was used in the combat simulation program For structured delimited output tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used Conversely for freeform chronological accounts of events regular expressions were used to perform the coarse matching while built-in Java functions were used for the precise extraction of information within a sentence While parsing the play-by-play file or the output files in the simulation domain is quite time consuming to write and difficult to get perfected it is conceptually the easiest at a high level The program simply examines a line determines if it matches a pattern extracts the necessary information and stores it in data structures until it is put into the ontology 7 5 htp.H Jena.sourceforge.nlet As mentioned earlier Jena handled all interactions with the ontology including combining the extracted data with the template ontology We refer to the original ontology as the template ontology because it provides the definition of the structure that holds the data but has not yet been realized with actual instances of the data thereby serving as a template for the associated classes When the combination of actual data with the template structure happens we say we have an output ontology which can then be queried using SPARQL Thus in order to transition from the template ontology to the output ontology we need to create instances of the event classes and fill in their properties Creating an instance of an RDF class in Jena follows the same pattern regardless of the domain First the template of the class is found in the ontology using the getOntClass function This template is then used to create a specific instance of the class using the createlndividual function Now that an individual is created its properties are set by either using the addProperty or setPropertyValue functions depending upon whether the property can have more than one value or not The getProperty and createTypedLiteral functions are typically required to provide the arguments when using either of the property-filling functions This same methodology can literally be used for creating any instance of a RDF function in Jena and serves as the substance to the magic referred to originally in Data Integration Manager of Figure 2 To further clarify the process we will now discuss the specifics of the how the template ontology was transformed into the output ontology for the football example As mentioned in the steps for ontologizing the data above the input files or the rosters of the teams in the case of football were put into the ontology first When the roster file was opened an instance of the Team class was created and the name property populated using the methodology described in the previous paragraph Then the information for each individual player was read one at a time As mentioned previously the Player class was used to represent a player in the ontology As a result an instance of the Player class was created for all the individuals on the roster and the setPropertyValue function of Jena was used to set its properties By repeating this for every player on the roster all the actors in the scenario were put into the ontology Once the definition of an individual Player was completed the Player was added to the team using the addProperty function which was used to allow for multiple Players to be on the same team With the input files completely parsed the event log files were parsed next In both domains the majority of the information came in the form of ASCII-text strings that included the actors the action performed and the context of action For football this information typically included the involved players names the type of play the game situation and the stats about the play such as the yards that were gained As mentioned above regular expressions were 7 


used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
