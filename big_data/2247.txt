INTRODUCTION \nWith today’s drastic increase in energy demand, it \nbecomes more and more important to use alternative green \ntechnologies Solar, wind, and hydroelectricity are popular \nchoices, because they are abundant and produce low \npollution One big challenge however is how to manage these \nnew energy resources together with the traditional electricity \ngrid. Today’s smart home technologies and devices offer a \nvariety of house appliances with embedded sensors. Through \nInternet websites or ad hoc applications, customers are able to \nmonitor household appliances and receive data from the \nsensors in real time. However, users do not receive any \nsuggestion on what measures to take to save energy and \nmoney. Recent developments in smart building and smart \ngrid domain 1] have suggested that we should embed sensing \nand controlling ability into these systems and their nsubsystems to monitor the real time heat exchange, water \nsupply, airflows and energy consumptions and then decide \nhow to regulate powers and energy from different resources.  \n    Smart homes require a complex integration of software \nand hardware design. Each appliance in the household has \nsensors that monitor the appliance power usage and \nperformance. Given a user requests to various appliances, an \noptimizer, based on energy supply and demand, can make \ndecisions on how to configure the household energy related \nelectronics and how to schedule appliances efficiently. It is \napparent that the key goal of the optimizer is to manage nenergy at every moment while satisfying user requested task \nschedules. The “energy management system” is composed of \na software module executing a number energy management \nalgorithms and a hardware module that control the physical \nimplementation of the management policies decided by the \nsoftware module. The software module is an online \nsimulation-based management system that makes decisions \nbased on the different types of tasks assigned. It also has the \nability to manage energy resources to achieve optimized \nsystem performance and efficiency. The hardware module \nimplements the physical management, i.e. it executes the \noptimized decisions coming from the software module. In \norder to provide optimized solutions and performance, it is nimportant for the software module to have access to user load \ndefined execution sequences, environmental constraints such \nas the maximum solar power available, the energy cost of \nloads, the power limit obtainable from the grid and other \nrelevant information. In addition, the individual sensors \nembedded in each appliance must report to the software \nenergy management module to provide real-time feedback to \nthe system. Utilizing the system real time information, the \nsoftware module then suggests a load-executing sequence that \nsatisfies user requirements, and at the same time provides the \noptimized total energy usage.  \n   This paper discusses a new power management system \ndesign. A new hardware design is developed to implement the \nproposed management energy solution. The new design \nconsists of bidirectional DC-DC converter and a battery ncharger/discharger circuit. By adopting this approach for smart \ngrid systems, we provide a management solution to optimized \nenergy distribution and usage. \nII. ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGN \nA.  Overview  \nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the three inputs of the designed \nsystem are the photovoltaic \(PV and the \ngrid utility. The DC-DC converter regulates the PV obtained \n517978-1-4799-0066-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n voltage based on the load requirements at any given time. The \nexcess energy available from the PV can be stored in a battery \nor any virtual storage device [2]. Under the worst condition, \nwhen solar energy is not available and there is not enough \nenergy stored in the virtual storage, the power management \nsystem disables the paths from both the PV modules and the \nvirtual storage, and utilizes the grid energy. At the output of \nthe system, there are multiple ports in the form of DC and AC \nloads. For the AC loads, the output of the DC-DC converter is \nconnected to the input of the inverter and then fed to the AC \nloads. For the DC loads, the output to the DC loads can be \nprovided directly by the DC-DC converter or can be regulated \nas required by passing through another DC-DC converter. Due \nto their efficiency, lifetime, reliability and low 


cost [2], in \nsmart homes, the most popular back up storage choice is the \nvalve regulated lead acid \(VRLA battery. \n \nFigure 1.  Block diagram of the physical energy management system \nSensors are attached to each of the end-user appliances to \ncontrol their ON/OFF operation. Most of the events are \nscheduled when maximum energy can be obtained from the \nPV cells. The power is supplied by the PV cells, the battery or \nthe grid based on the cost per unit of energy. During the night, \nwe try to use the least amount of power possible Energy \nprovided at night is distributed either by the battery and/or the \ngrid. The ratio again depends on the cost.  The load scheduling \nis done on an hourly basis and fed as input to the control of the \nenergy management system that is comprised of a DC-DC \nconverter and a DC-AC inverter. Based on the PV power and \nthe load power, our DC-DC converter works either as a buck \nconverter or a boost converter. The duty cycle of the converter \nis adjusted based on the load curve. Excess energy is stored in \nthe battery during the buck mode of operation. During the \nboost mode of operation, if the load power is greater than the \nPV power, energy is discharged from the battery. If both the \nPV power and the battery power cannot meet the load \nrequirements then the grid needs to be activated.   \nB. Energy Management Bidirectional DC-DC Converter \nThe DC-DC converter is considered as one of the most \nimportant parts of the energy management system. Many \ndifferent types of DC-DC converters [4-6] were reviewed and \nstudied to understand their operation and performance, and neventually choose the most suitable one for this specific \napplication. The bidirectional battery charger/discharger \n\(a.k.a. buck/boost bidirectional converter capabilities and operating modes and it \ncan be modified for storing excess energy, and to use the \nbattery as a back-up source when the energy generated by the \nprimary source \(PV modules nuser’s needs. The buck/boost bidirectional converter can be \nemployed in the power management of solar applications to \nachieve both step-down and step-up functions and has the \nadvantages of simple configuration fast response, and easy \ncontrol. Battery can also be charged and discharged via the \nbidirectional converter Since the PV modules generates a \nnon-constant output power, the noise and the ripple voltage \ncan degrade the efficiency of the converter. To protect and \novercome this issue, capacitors are placed in parallel to nstabilize the operation voltage. The inductors in the power \nDC-DC converter can be energized by the PV generated \npower or the battery. When the PV modules are not producing \nany power, the switches are turned off, and the energy stored \nin the inductor is released and transferred to the output.  As \nillustrated in Figure 2, the inductor is placed after the switch in \nthe buck converter, and is located before the switches in the \nboost converter.  \n \nFigure 2.  Configuration of the energy management DC-DC converter \nThe DC-DC converter consists of both buck and boost \nconverters and a bidirectional buck-boost converter to charge \nand discharge the battery. This can be considered as multiple \ninput multiple output \(MIMO battery \nworks as either input or output. The primary input of the DC-\nDC converter is the PV cells, which generate power using \nsunlight. The output power of the PV cells is limited by its \nperformance and it is defined by the manufacturing process.  \nOne of the main functions of the DC-DC converter is to step \nup or down the voltage. The voltage will be stepped down if \nthe load requirement is less than the power generated by the \nPV cells, and the excess will be stored in the battery via the \nbidirectional converter. The voltage will be boosted up to the \ndesired level if the load requirement exceeds the power \ngenerated. In this case the battery may be turned into a \nbackup source if excess power is necessary. The output of the \nconverter can be directly connected to the load, or to the input \nof another DC-DC converter or to the input of a DC-AC ninverter. In addition, it is very important to understand the \nvarious modes of operation that occurs depending on the \ndifferent load conditions. The first case to consider is the light \nmode condition. In this case, the power required at the load is \nless than the power generated by the PV cells.  \n  Light Mode: PLoad Pgenerated \(1 and the battery is considered as \nan output and will be charged from the excess energy \ngenerated by the PV modules. The circuit diagram for the light \nmode is described in Figure 3. The current flows are described nwith arrows.  The current goes from the source to the load and \nto the battery.  In buck mode switch S4 is always ON, switch  \nS3 is always OFF and S1 and S2 keep switching. While the \ncurrent flows from the PV cells to the load switch S5 is OFF \nand switch S2 is OFF. When the battery is charging \(and \n518\n current flows from the PV cells to the load nof the switches during this operation. The pulse width \nmodulation \(PWM dependent \non the following factors: load power, power generated by the \nPV cells, feedback voltage and the reference voltage. \n \nFigure 3.  Operation of the DC-DC converter during the light mode \n \nFigure 4.  Control signals during \(a b nthe PV cells, excess energy is available at the source. This \nexcess energy is delivered and stored in 


batteries by charging \nthem up. This ensures that no energy is wasted. The energy \nstored in the battery can be retrieved when the load \nconsumption exceeds the PV power generation, or when there \nis no PV generation night time or cloudy and hazy days converter during heavy mode \nThe second case is the heavy mode condition, which occurs \nwhen the output power from the PV modules is less than the \nload requirement. In this case, it is assumed that the battery is ninitially charged \(i.e. for generality, we assume the heavy \nmode phase follows a light mode phase Mode: PLoad > Pgenerated \(2 operate both the PV modules and the \nbattery to power the load together. As illustrated in Figure 5, \nthe output power of the PV modules will be boosted up \nthrough different switches. In boost mode the switch S2 is nalways OFF and S3 and S4 keep switching. The switches S1 \nand S5 switch with a half period of S3 and S4.  The nbidirectional battery charger/discharger also sends its stored \nenergy to the load through switches S4 and S5 and the \nsecondary inductor Ls. During the charging mode of the \nbidirectional converter, the current of the secondary inductor, \nLs, keeps increasing through the switches S3 and S5 until the \nswitch S4 turns ON. As soon as the switch S4 turns ON, the \ninductor current decreases to deliver its stored current to \npower the load.  In case of cloudy days, hazy days or at night \nthe bidirectional DC-DC converter is enabled and powers the \nload through S4 and S5. The path from the PV modules is \ncompletely disabled since it is not generating any power.  \nHowever, most of the time, the battery itself cannot provide \nadequate energy to power up all the loads, so the grid utility \nis enabled to supply the necessary power. If the energy \ngenerated from both PV modules and stored energy in the \nbattery is not sufficient, the real time task coordinator will \nassign the grid utility to power the load by itself. For \nsimplicity, the grid is not shown in the circuit level nschematic, but is assumed to be present in the system. \nControlling the gates of the MOSFETs is essential and naffects the performance significantly. Many different \ncontrolling methods have been proposed by researchers in \norder to provide stable, efficient, fast and accurate signals to \ncontrol the switches [3-5]. Since the DC-DC converter \noutputs a stable DC voltage to the DC-AC inverter, the output \nvoltage fed back is adopted to control the gates of the \ntransistors. The output voltage of the DC-DC converter is \nsensed by a voltage sensor and compared with a reference \nvoltage \(Vset PI controller. The output of PI controller is sent \nto a pulse-width modulation \(PWM noutput of the PWM circuit can be sent to a driver circuit to \nproduce the signal necessary to control the gates of \nMOSFETs in the DC-DC converters. Unfortunately, this \nconventional analog control feedback mechanism is very \ndifficult to implement in our situation. In our situation, a \ndifferent control mechanism is required because of the load \nscheduling and energy management interface model of the \nsoftware module. Among the various methods that are \nsuitable for our application is the use of an accurate and fast \nmicrocontroller. We propose to control the operation of the \nphysical power distribution model using a PIC controller \n\(F560DC The power generated by the PV cells and the \npower required by the load will be sensed and fed into two \ninput parameters of the controller, and these two values are \ndirectly related to the performance and play an important role \nin the control algorithm. The variables used in the algorithm \nare defined as follows: PIN Power generated by the PV \nmodules, PLOAD: Power required by the load, Pboost: Power at \nthe output of the boost converter, Pbattery: power stored in the \nbattery. The microcontroller has a built-in PWM controller to ncontrol the gates of the MOSFETs. The range for the PWM \ncontroller will be set based on our DC-DC converter design. \nBased on the PLOAD, the duty cycle of the converter will be \nadjusted and the excess power will be stored in the battery. \nThe value of the power stored in the battery will constantly be \nfed back to the controller. Here, if “PIN < PLOAD” then we \n“enable the boost mode of the DC-DC converter”. The output \nin the boost mode is sensed and is fed back to the controller. \nThe controller then calculates the boosted output power \n519\n available. This boosted output power is then compared with \nthe power required by the load. We do not encounter any \nproblem if Pboost is greater than PLOAD. Hence, we proceed to \nthe case when Pboost is less than PLOAD.  Here, if “Pboost < Pload” \nthen we “regulate Pbattery to supply the deficit power”. And, if \n Pbattery + Pboost < PLOAD”, then we “obtain power from the \ngrid”. \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nAll experimental simulations were carried out using \nHSPICE. The experiments were conducted for a single PV \ncell the output of which is provided as input to the DC-DC \nconverter. Tables II to IV illustrate the various results that \nhave been obtained for the efficiency of the DC-DC converter \nof the physical energy management system. The DC-DC \nconverter is an integral part of the physical energy \nmanagement system that is responsible for transmitting the PV \nenergy to the load. Table I gives the values for the total time \ntaken by the converter to transmit energy under different \nloading cases. It can be observed that it normally takes more ntime to transmit energy when there are multiple output sources \n\(e.g. battery charging and load

Figure 6 summarizes the boost converter \nefficiency for different input voltages and different duty \ncycles. The input voltage has been varied in steps of 0.1 V nfrom 0.3V to 0.7V and the values for the corresponding input \ncurrent, output voltage and output current have been tabulated. \nThe efficiency has then been calculated using \(1 nEfficiency = PIN ?

In this case, multiple inputs \(PV cells and battery energy management system are activated.

process the JSON data into an intermediary\ndata format or do any processing on the message itself.\nMongoDB however must convert the data to BSON, a bi-\nnary based implementation of JSON. This first requires parsing\nthe JSON into Ruby’s native hash structure and from there\nconverting it to BSON data. JSON parsing would be required\nin any application performing this task and so as a real world\ntest, it is fair to include this load during MongoDB’s tests.\nThe YAJL C library is used in these tests which is currently\nconsidered to be one of the most efficient implementations\navailable. The Ruby MongoDB driver is also using the native\nC BSON driver, so the use of Ruby is not unfairly affecting\nthe results.\nHowever to determine whether the performance issues are\nin the JSON library, an additional test was done where the data\nwas converted to a hash only once. This hash was then passed\nto the MongoDB driver. This was repeated for both document\nsizes and get the results in table V and VI for both the 1KB\nand 3KB tests respectively.\nTABLE V. TIME TAKEN TO INSERT 1KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken \(seconds 4.79 19.12\nThroughput \(inserts per second TO INSERT 3KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken seconds inserts per second tests demonstrate that a significant amount of the\ntime is being spent parsing the JSON to a Ruby hash With\nthe 1KB documents, performance increased by approximately\n38.4% and by 52.6% for the 3KB documents. This suggests\nthat as the complexity and size of the document increases,\nthe time required to parse it also increases. However despite\nremoving the JSON parsing from the test, CakeDB remained\n5.4 times faster in the 1KB test and 5.5 times faster in the\n3KB test.\nD. Conclusions\nThe initial tests with both 1KB and 3KB documents\nshowed that CakeDB has better throughput for handling in-\nserts. This is due to its low impact client, streaming inserts\nand latched insert handling on the database itself. The results\ndemonstrate that a specialized database can out perform a\ngeneral purpose database and that CakeDB has significant\nperformance benefits over MongoDB. Additional tests showed\nthat even with pre-hashed datasets and using bulk inserts,\nMongoDB was not able to approach the performance offered\n63\nby CakeDB. This suggests that the performance difference is\nnot simply due to external overhead \(such as JSON parsing in industry there are numerous workloads that do\nnot lend themselves well to a ‘scale out’ approach. This paper\nproposed a disk based approach for storing and then retrieving\nsequential data. By using disk rather than RAM as the main\nform of storage, this approach is able to store significantly\nmore data on a given machine.\nXV. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nCurrently CakeDB only supports simple time range based\nqueries. This works well for reporting, but limits its applica-\nbility to more general use cases. To address this, support is\nbeing added for BSON \(Binary JSON allow for\nricher and more precise queries.\nAlthough CakeDB did not initially focus on read perfor-\nmance, in general usage, read performance was significantly\nbetter than expected. Further research will be undertaken to\ndetermine whether or not such an approach could yield similar\nread performance to current systems \(such as MongoDB Data\nraises questions as to how value can or should be defined.\nIt could be said that the value of data consists of both\nintrinsic and extrinsic value. Further research will be conducted\nto see whether pricing algorithms \(such as those used in\npricing financial derivatives value\nbenchmark.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Kallman, H. Kimura, J. Natkins, A.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
