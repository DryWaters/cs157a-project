Introduction With the rapid evolution of Internet and the broad 
application of computer technology, the number of electronic texts increases quickly. How to manage and utilize these resources becomes an imminent issue Automatic text categorization technique is one solution Automatic text categorization can be defined as assigning class labels to new texts based on the knowledge obtained in a categorization system at th e training stag veral classifiers have been devised and used abroad, such as decision trees [2 n e ur al n e t w or ks [3 k near est n e ighb or s   support vect or m achi n es [5  and association rule   
Categorization based on association rules needs short time to train and classify, and the classifier built can be understood easily   1  6  have ap pl i e d a ssoci at i o n r u l e s to classify texts, and expe riments show that they are effective. But they ignored different words’ contribution to text categorization. Words which exist in all categories do little contribution to categorization, while the words having large proportion in one category but small proportion in others do great contribution. In previous approaches, if a text contains all the words appearing in a rule, the rule 
matches the text or the rule satisfies the text. Because of ignoring the word frequency, the number of rules satisfying the same text increases. This paper offers a novel approach which introduces fuzzy sets concept in, so the classification rules not only contain words, but also the corresponding frequencies. The degree of a word appearing in texts is restricted in the classifier, so texts can be classified more accurately than previous approaches  2.  Background knowledge 2.1. Association rule Definition1 Let I= {i 1 i m be a set of items, and D 
be a set of transactions where each transaction T  I. An association rule is an implication of the form “X Y where X  I, Y  I, and X Y  The support of the rule X Y is the percentage of transactions in D that contain both X and Y, and the confidence of the rule is the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also 
contain Y. The problem of discovering association rules from D consists of generating the rules having higher support and confidence than given thresholds. These rules are called strong rule   2.2. Fuzzy association rule  Fuzzy method is proposed to cope with quantitative association rule mining [8 Fo r qu an titativ e attrib u t es, the  ordinary treatment is transforming them into binary ones There are two traditional methods. The first is to partition the attribute domain into discrete intervals. Each element maps to its own interval. However, some related intervals 
may be missed because this partition excludes some potential elements near the sharp boundaries. The second is to divide the domain into overlapping regions. The boundaries of intervals overlap one another, so each element locating near the boundaries maps to two intervals which surely overemphasizes the importance of these elements. The literature [9 r op o s ed a soft m e th o d The  attribute domain is divided into several fuzzy sets, and an 


Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Mach ine Learning and Cybernetics, Dalian, 13-16 August 2006  1031 element belongs to a set with a membership value. Fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between members and non-members of a set, so fewer boundary elements are excluded. Moreover, because the membership degree of an element outside an interval is smaller than that in the interval, it is not overemphasized. Usually fuzzy sets are described by linguistic terms, which make them understood more easily  Let D= {T 1 T n be a set of transactions and T j is the j th tuple. Let I={i 1 i m be a set of items, where each attribute i k associates with a set of fuzzy sets     1 l ik ik f f so the set I can be expressed by y 1 y m where y k is a fuzzy set associated with one attribute of I. The membership degree of T j in the fuzzy set y k is denoted by T j y k  Definition2 Let X={y 1 y p and Y={y p+1 y p+q be  fuzzy subsets of I, and X Y  In the fuzzy association rule X Y, the support of X is defined as  n y T X Sup n j p i i j     1 1     1 The support of X Y is defined as  n y T Sup n j q p i i j     1 1   2 The confidence of X Y is defined as    X Sup Sup Conf  3 3.  Related work The literature [6 us ed the ap proach pres ente d in [10 to  build classifier and it brought a new method to predict classes forward. However, the process of building classifier is complex. When one rule is added into the classifier, it is necessary to calculate the curren t total number of errors and to determine the default-class over again. Th proposed a method to select rules according to their ranks It is easier to build a classifier, but it also has some limitations. It predicts classes for new texts only by confidence, and it does not cons ider the frequency of words This paper improves the approach proposed in [1   combining the class prediction method in [6 t h en  designs a text classifier based on fuzzy association rules. In this section, we introduce the categorization approach in  and in the next section, the improved version will be introduced The process of building classi fier in [1 e n e ralized as follows Step1: Data preprocessing. In this step, data cleaning is required. The useless words fo r building classifier can be weeded out according to a given list of stop words and TF/IDF values. For mining association rules, texts should be transformed into transactions. A text corresponds to a transaction, which consists of the cleansed words and the class label attached to the text  Step2: Rule mining. The Apriori algorithm is used to mine association rules. It is needed to divide the training text set into subsets by categor y first, and then association rules are mined on each subset. When all rules are generated, each rule’s confidence can be calculated based on the whole rule set. Deleting the rule whose confidence is lower than the minimum confidence threshold, the remainder rules are strong rules Algorithm1: Mining association rules Input: A set of texts of the form d i c, w 1 w n  where c is the class label attached to the text, and w i is a feature word of the text; Th e minimum support threshold min-sup; The minimum confidence threshold min-conf Output: A set of association rules of the form w 1    w m c Method 1 generate the candidate 1-itemsets C 1  2 generate the frequent 1-itemsets F 1  3 for \(i=2; F i-1  i 4  combine two items of F i-1 to generate C i  5   delete the item whose \(i-1\set  F i-1 from C i  6   delete the text containing no item in F i-1  7   calculate the support of each item in C i  8   according to min-sup, generate F i  9 for each item M in F i i>1  10  generate the rule M c Step3: Rule pruning. In the mining phase, too many rules are mined. Such a large number of rules would decrease the classification effectiveness and efficiency, so pruning is required. The criterion of pruning is that removing the rule containing more words but having lower confidence, and removing the rule which can not classify any training text correctly Definition3 Being given two rules R 1 and R 2 R 1 has higher rank than R 2 if 1 1 has higher confidence than R 2  2\ If the confidences are equal, the support of R 1 must exceed R 2  3\ Both confidences and supports are equal, but R 1 has less attributes in antecedent than R 2  Algorithm2: Pruning association rules  Input: The training text set D; The rule set S found in the mining phase

The form of rules in the classifier    Step4: Classifying new texts. The rules survived in the pruning phase constitute the actual classifier. The form of rules in the classifier is shown in Table 1. Given a text without class label, the classification process is matching all rules in the classifier with th e text. Usually, there are many rules matching the text. If these rules have the same consequent, no doubt the text falls into the category corresponding to the consequent. But it is more general that the consequents are different. In this case, we should estimate which class is more suitable. Here the average confidence is used to predict classes for new texts Algorithm3: Text classification Input: A new text d; The classifier ARC \(the rules in ARC have been sorted according to definition 3\ The confidence threshold   Output: Class assigned to the new text Method 1 initialize the rule set S as   2 for each rule R in ARC 3  if R satisfies d 4   if R is the first rule  5\   save R in S, and save its confidence in Maxconf; // the first rule has the highest confidence 6   else if R.conf > Maxconf  7 save R in S 8  divide S into subsets by category 9  calculate the averag e confidence on each subset 10\ assign the class label corresponding to the subset which has the highest value to d 4.  Algorithm improvement 4.1. Data preprocessing The paper cl assi fi ed En gl i s h t e xt s, w h i l e  we deal with Chinese texts in this paper. For Chinese texts, the first thing is segmenting them into words. Then the method of Information Gain [11  is u s ed to select featu r e word s from training texts. For building a fu zzy classifier, the weights of feature words are used to desc ribe the frequency of words appearing in texts. We use the method of Entropy-weighting 11 to calculate weigh t s. After all th e weigh t s are calculated, the operation of transforming texts into transactions is completed  4.2. Fuzzification The word-items in transactions are expressed by word, weight> pairs, where we ight is real-value. If rules were mined on these precise values, the obtained rules would be too special, and have no meaning [9  I n sect i o n  2.2, three methods are introduced to deal with quantitative attributes. We adopt fuzzy sets to define weight, and use natural language to describe the fuzzy sets. In our experiments, we partition the weight domain into three fuzzy sets and define three linguistic terms: f, m, and n to describe them separately. The partition is shown in Figure 1 which is drawn based on the distribution of weights. From Figure 1, we can calculate the membership values of each word in the three fuzzy sets, and transform original crisp transactions into fuzzy ones  4.3. Fuzzy association rules generation We improve the mining algorithm in [1  min e fu zzy association rules. In the impr oved algorithm, the form of the input text is di:{c,<w 1 l 1 w n l n where l i is a fuzzy set, and the form of the output rule is <w 1 l 1     w m l m  c. In the mining process, we should store not only words in candidate item-sets C i and frequent  agriculture>, <farm produce Agriculture computer>, <input Computer art>, <main body>, <create Art 


Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Mach ine Learning and Cybernetics, Dalian, 13-16 August 2006  1033 item-sets F i but also their corres ponding fuzzy sets. The membership values need not to be reserved. Take an example to explain: the member ship degree of the word w 1 in the fuzzy set f is 0.6, in the set m is 0.4, and in the last set n is 0. Suppose min-sup is 0.2, <w 1 f>and<w 1 m> should be stored in F 1 but the values 0.6 and 0.4 need not to be stored 4.4. Rule pruning In the pruning algorithm in t is classified b y  a rule correctly, the text is deleted and the rules covering the same text are removed, but some significant rules may be lost. To improve this algorithm, we set a cover-count variab whic h is use d to rec o rd how many rules cover the text correctly. The initialization is 0 When a rule classifies a text correctly, add 1 to the variable value of this text. When the value equals to the given threshold, the text is deleted. That allows more selected rules. When classifying a new text, it may have more rules to consult. If a classifier contained too few rules, there would be many new texts matching with no rule. However if the number of rules in a classifier were too large, the classification error rate would increase, and the efficiency would decrease. By experiments it is found that when the cover-count threshold is 4, the classification performance is optimal. In our approach, the default-class i s de fi ne d  which will be used in the next phase. We choose the category which contains the larg est number of training texts covered by no rule correctly to be the default-class  The fuzzy classifier we build consists of many rules Only four rules are selected to show in Table 2. Compared with Table 1, we can find that the rules in the fuzzy classifier contain the frequency of words. We use the fuzzy sets corresponding to weights to represent the frequency. If the weight of a word locates between two fuzzy sets, in other words, if a word has membership degrees in two fuzzy sets simultaneously, the case that several rules contain same words but different fuzzy sets in antecedents would occur. The first two rules in Table 2 show this case Table2. The form of rules in the fuzzy classifier     4.5.  Class Prediction The paper [1 p p lie d a v er ag e confidence to predict classes for new texts, but there is a limitation. Suppose rules R 1 and R 2 both satisfy the new text d, where R 1  w 1 f>, <w 2 m C 1 conf=92 sup=5 and R 2 w 1 f w 3 n C 2 conf=90 sup = 30 According to their confidences, C 1 should be assigned to d, because the confidence of R 1 is higher than R 2 But in fact, assigning C 2 to d is more reasonable. Although R 2 has appreciably lower confidence, its support is far higher than R 1 We adopt the method proposed in  It  us ed min \(preofrule\up conf\ict class, where min \(preofrule\he minimum time that the words in the antecedent of a rule appear in the new text, sup and conf are the rule’s support and confidence separately. We calculate the sum of min preofrule\*sup * conf on e ach rule subset to replace the average confidence. Because multi factors are taken into account, the limitation existing in the average confidence method clears away. The categorization method in  doe s not consider the case that there is no rule matching the new text, which generally occurs. We use the default-class defined in rule pruning phase to deal with this case. If there is no rule satisfying the new text, we assign the default-class to it Classifying texts by fuzzy association rules is matching words and their frequency in rules with these in texts. If a word does not appear in the classifier, the word is useless, because it does not have any influence on categorization. Therefore, we can remove the words that do not appear in the classifier from texts to improve categorization efficiency 5  Experimental results and performance analysis Experimental data comes from Chinese text database of Fudan University. The texts in the database belong to 20 categories, but the nu mbers of texts in each category are not equal. If training texts are too few, they are not sufficient to train a classifier. Thus, we ignore the categories which contain less than 100 texts, and only consider nine categories with larger number. Table 3 shows the numbers of texts of each category in bot h training set and testing set We use precision, recall, ma cro-average F1 and total  to evaluate t h e performance of our approach. In experiments, four approaches are compared. In these approaches, we do the same preprocessing operation on the training texts, and in the rule mining process the support and confidence thresholds are uniform, which are 1% and 30% separately The experimental results are shown in Table 4 In Table 4, Method1 and Method2 represent the categorization method in [1 d [6 sep a rat e ly  Meth od 3 i s  an improvement on Method1.

On the basis of Method3, Method4 introduces fuzzy sets in, and obtains better results   6.  Conclusion This paper introduces a new approach for text categorization, which is an improvement on the existing association rules categorization approaches. It first proposes to introduce fuzzy sets concept in text categorization Experiments show that it is feasible and the performance of our approach is improved further. In class prediction process, new texts should match with fuzzy rules, so it is needed to calculate weights of the words in new texts Therefore, this method is suitable for the case of classifying many texts once. Compared with traditional approaches our method increases the spending on weights calculation and fuzzification.

The P/R breakeven point indicates the value at which precision equals recall. The larger the measure scores the better the system performs. The precision of top-K returned documents is another important measure which refers to the relative value of relevant documents in the first K returned document The results of P/R breakeven point of ten topics are listed in Table 2, which shows that the improvement is achieved by using PTM with pruning. As the min_sup  increases, the average value of P/R breakeven point of ten topics reduces slightly from 0.409 to 0.406. This Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence \(WI  04 0-7695-2100-2/04 $ 20.00 IEEE means that the effects of these pruned patterns are not significant since their supports are relatively smaller than the remained patterns. The performance is obviously enhanced by applying the pruning scheme as we can see the measure of P/R breakeven value increased from 0.406 to 0.443. This is caused by the fact that the noises of meaningless patterns are reduced as they are pruned. By using combination of min_sup and pruning scheme as constraints, we can not only save computation time but also improve the accuracy Table 3 shows the precision of top-20 returned documents on each topic. It is obvious that the PTM-2 outperforms other three models as far as the average P/R breakeven point concerned. However, the measure of PTM-1 is even lower than the result of the keywordbased model Pr. The reason is that the  overfitting   caused by the meaningless patterns of PTM-1 influences the effectiveness of the system. Thus, in order to enhance the performance, the pruning scheme is required to be a part of the pattern-based models Table 3.

Related work and conclusion Mining sequential patterns has been extensively studied in data mining community since the first research work in [1]. The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
