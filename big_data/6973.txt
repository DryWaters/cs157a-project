Identifying Frequent Items in P2P Systems Mei Li Microsoft Corporation Redmond WA 98052 USA meili@microsoft.com Wang-Chien Lee Pennsylvania State University State College PA 16802 USA wlee@cse.psu.edu Abstract  As peer-to-peer P2P systems receive growing acceptance the need of identifying frequent items in such systems appears in a variety of applications In this paper we de\036ne the problem of identifying frequent items IFI and propose an ef\036cient in-network processing technique called in-net work lter ing netFilter  to address this important fundamental problem netFilter operates in two phases 1 candidate 036ltering data items are grouped into item groups to obtain aggregates for pruning of infrequent items and 2 candidate veri\036cation the aggregates for the remaining candidate items are obtained to 036lter out false frequent items We address various issues faced in realizing netFilter including aggregate computation candidate set optimization and candidate set materialization In addition we analyze the performance of netFilter derive the optimal setting analytically and discuss how to achieve the optimal setting in practice Finally we validate the effectiveness of netFilter through extensive simulation I I NTRODUCTION Peer-to-peer P2P systems such as BitTorrent 1 G nut el l a 2 and N aps t er 3  ha v e become popul ar pl at forms for sharing and exchanging voluminous information among thousands or even millions of users Since there is no centralized administration in P2P systems peers have to collaborate with each other to perform vari ous tasks including routing indexing and searching Moreover various system statistics and valuable user access information are distributed amongst peers making applications that need a global view of such information/statistics particularly difﬁcult to operate 1 Since many applications require the statistics for frequently accessed les e.g MP3 frequently happened events e.g network attacks frequently issued queries e.g keywords etc in this paper we focus on developing efﬁcient techniques for identifying frequent items in P2P systems 2  Here we rst deﬁne the problem of identifying frequent item IFI in P2P systems Assume that a P2P system has N peers and the data set of interest A has n distinct data items e.g recording number of downloads of n pop songs Peer i  1 001 i 001 N  has a local item set A i 002A  Each item  x  in A i has a local value  denoted by v i x  indicating the value associated with Item x at Peer i The global value of Item x  denoted by v x  is the sum of the local values at all the peers in the system i.e v x  001 N i 1 v i x  Given a threshold value t IFI This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation under IIS-0328881 IIS-0534343 and CNS-0626709 1 A music marketing rm may want to nd out which MP3 songs have been downloaded more than 10,000 times in the past week 2 Since those events and access patterns are usually logged in data les we collectively refer them as data items  identiﬁes the frequent items whose global values are greater than t  IFI can then be formally deﬁned as IFI  A t   x  x 003A v x 004 t   Essential operations in a variety of P2P applications can be transformed into the problem of IFI as summarized in Table I In the table we summarize these operations their corresponding applications and the local item set maintained at a peer Peer i with 1 001 i 001 N  and the local value associated with an item in transformation to the problem of IFI All of these applications can be realized by identifying the frequent items with global values greater than a given threshold value Although the problem of IFI is prevailing in P2P systems it is not yet addressed by previous works based on the authors best knowledge In this study we investigate this problem in depth We assume that peers form an unstructured P2P systems where no global index structure is maintained Effectively identifying the frequent items in such unstructured P2P systems is challenging A naive solution is to collect the global value for each item and then output the items with global values exceeding the threshold as the results However the frequent items are usually a small portion of the whole set of items in the system Therefore collecting the global value for each item obviously is an overkill In this study we propose an efﬁcient in-network ltering technique called netFilter for identifying frequent items in P2P systems netFilter operates in two phases 1 candidate ltering and 2 candidate veriﬁcation  To perform candidate ltering items are grouped into disjoint item groups and the aggregates 3 for these item groups are obtained from the system These aggregates of item groups act as lters to prune majority of unqualiﬁed item groups from further consideration A small subset of items is retained as the candidates  Candidate veriﬁcation is then invoked to obtain the global values for these candidates to verify whether they truly satisfy the threshold condition The set of frequent items identiﬁed through netFilter is precise in terms of the following two aspects First there is no false positives infrequent items that are incorrectly reported as frequent items or false negatives frequent items that are not identiﬁed Second the reported global values of the frequent items are precise 3 The aggregate for an item or a set of items refers to the combined value for the item\(s from different peers in the system For instance the aggregate for Item x  a x s 001 i 001P v i x  P\001 1  2   N   When P   1  2   N   the aggregate for x is also the global value of x  In such cases we use global value and aggregate interchangeable if the context is clear

items Fig 1 An illustrative example of netFilter The example in Figure 1 illustrates the basic concept behinds netFilter The system has three peers P1 P2 and P3 Their local item sets are de picted in the tables besides the peers where the left and r ight columns represent the identiﬁers of the items and their lo cal values respectively The threshold value  t s 3  We assume the eight items are assigned to four item groups as follows Items a and b are assigned to Item-group 1 and so on During candidate ltering we collect an aggregate for each item group Among the four item groups only Item-group 2 has its aggregate above the threshold value Thus only the two items Items c and d  belonging to Item-group 2 are retained as the candidates During candidate veriﬁcation the global values for Items c and d are obtained as 1 and 3 respectively Thus Item d is returned as the result Three important technical issues need to be addressed in netFilter 1 aggregate computation  i.e how to obtain the aggregate for an item or a set of items from all the peers spread in the system 2 candidate set optimization  i.e how to obtain a good candidate set with majority of them truly satisfying the threshold condition 3 candidate set materialization i.e how to generate or materialize the candidate set for candidate veriﬁcation with no peer having a global view of the complete item set in the system We propose techniques to address these issues Moreover to optimize the performance of netFilter we derive the optimal setting mathematically and discuss how to achieve the optimal setting in practice Finally we evaluate the effectiveness of netFilter t hrough extensive simulations The rest of this paper is organized as follows In Section II we review some relevant works The design details of netFilter and its analysis are presented in Section III and Section IV respectively The evaluation of netFilter is presented in Section V We draw the conclusion and outline future directions in Section VI II R ELATED W ORKS Reference 6 propos es t echni ques t o a ddres s i ceber g query  which is relevant to IFI However the technique is designed for centralized systems where all items

coordinator or multicasted to a small number of sites for processing In our work the data are inherently distributed among peers Thus these techniques are infeasible due to the excessive communication overhead Some works investigate collecting the approximate count for an item in the networks e.g 13   15  7  8  p ropos e gossip mechanisms to obtain the aggregates in P2P systems Different from these works we focus on identifying frequent items rather than obtaining the counts for all the items 4 proposes a technique to perform top-k retrieval in P2P systems This work is different from our study in the following two aspects First top-k ret rieval only needs to report k items while in IFI the number of items that need to be reported might be very large Second in 4 t h e a ut hors a s s u me t h at each item only appears in the local item set of one peer i.e the non-zero local value of an item at a peer is the global value of this item On the contrary we do not make such an assumption Instead we need to address for which items we need to collect the global value s for and how the global value for an item is collected from the system The works that are most relevant to our study are

item sets Fig 2 The operations of netFilter these studies we investigate obtaining a precise set of frequent items without the aforementioned errors Obtaining a precise set of frequent items is necessary in certain applications For instance false positives are not desirable in network attack detection As another examp le in cache management the precise global values of the frequent items e.g keywords or documents are required to facilitate cache replacement The proposed techniques in   12  a re not appl i cabl e t o addres s the problem of obtaining the precise set of frequent items which we are addressing here III I N N ETWORK F ILTERING netFilter consists of two phases candidate ltering and candidate veriﬁcation We summarize the basic operations of netFilter in Algorithm 1 where candidate ltering and candidate veriﬁcation correspond to Lines 1-3 and Line 4 in Algorithm 1 respectively Algorithm 1 Algorithm for netFilter 1 Partition items into item groups 2 Obtain aggregate for each item group 3 Prune unqualiﬁed item groups with aggr egates below the threshold and obtain the items in the remaining item groups as candidates 4 Obtain the global values for the candidates and return the items with global values above the threshold as the results Three important issues need to be addressed carefully in netFilter  Aggregate computation Both candidate ltering and candidate veriﬁcation require computing the aggregates corresponding to the item groups during candidate ltering and candidate items during candidate veriﬁcation respectively Peers have to collaborate with each other to obtain the global value for an item or a set of items  Candidate set optimization The effectiveness of netFilter relies on the goodness of the candidate set i.e how many items in the candidate set truly satisfy the threshold and how many do not The latter are false positives in the candidate set How to reduce the number of false positives in the candidate set is an important issue 4   Candidate set materialization After candidate ltering the candidate set should be materialized and then disseminated to the system for candidate veriﬁcation Given the item groups satisfying the threshold a peer would be able to produce the complete candidate set if it had the knowledge of the complete set of items in the whole system Unfortunately each peer normally only has a partial set of items in its local item set i.e A i 005A  4 Note that the false positives here refer to infrequent items in the candidate set There is no false position in the nal set of frequent items returned after candidate veriﬁcation Figure 2 illustrates the operations of netFilter and the issues involved in different phases of netFilter Our strategies to address these issues are detailed in the subsequent subsections A Aggregate Computation To obtain the aggregate for an item or a set of items two possible approaches are 1 gossip-based aggregate computation called gossip aggregation in short 8 15   w here peers exchange their current aggregates with their neighbors till the aggregates almost converge to the global values 2 hierarchy-based aggregate computation called hierarchical aggregation in short 13  w here peers f orm i nt o a hi erarchi cal infrastructure and pass the aggregates in a bottom up fashion along the hierarchy The gossip aggregation mechanisms proposed in the literature require multiple  O  logN   rounds of communication among peers till the aggregates almost converge Among these proposals 8 i s vul nerabl e t o p eer failure The technique proposed in 15 is more f a ult-res ilient but only obtains approximate aggregates On the other hand hierarchical aggregation normally requires one or two rounds of communications among peers to obtain the precise aggregates even though it is more sensitive to the leave or failure of the peers at the higher levels of the hierarchy In this paper we follow the basic principle of hierarchical aggregation to design our aggregate computation The major concern with forming a hierarchy in P2P systems is the frequent update of the hierarchy upon peer join/leave/failure To avoid this we only recruit peers that are more stable e.g being online for a longer time to perform netFilter where other peers forward their local item sets to one of these peers participating in netFilter The assumption of existence of stable peers is reasonable as discussed in 14 N e v e rt hel e s s  t h e proposed technique is applicable to a well-designed gossip aggregation which is left as our future work In the following discussions if unspeciﬁed otherwise peers refer to the peers participating in netFilter In the following we rst discuss how to obtain the aggregates along the hierarchy and how to update the hierarchy upon peer join/leave/failure 1 Forming Hierarchy Peers form a hierarchy based on the principle of breadth-ﬁrst-s earch BFS Basically each peer Peer i with 1 001 i 001 N  becomes a node in the hierarchy at depth d  i  as follows  d  i  is the length of the shortest path in terms of logical hops from the root of the hierarchy to this peer A designated peer is rst chosen as the root node of the hierarchy with depth as 0  This designated peer could be a randomly selected peer the most stable peer or a peer that is close to the center of the network In this study we choose a peer randomly as the root node and leave other options for future exploration The immediate neighbors of the root node become the nodes at depth 1 in the hierarchy They set the root node as their upstream neighbor and set themselves as the downstream

neighbors of the root node The immediate neighbors of the peers at depth 1 that are not yet included in the hierarchy become the nodes at depth 2 in the hierarchy This process continues till we reach the peers whose immediate neighbors are all already included in the hierarchy i.e these peers have no downstream neighbors Such peers are the leaf nodes of the hierarchy The nodes that are neither the root or leaf nodes are called the internal nodes of the hierarchy In netFilter the communication cost incurred at the peers located at the higher levels of the hierarchy is almost the same as that incurred at the peers lo cated at the lower levels of the hierarchy as detailed in Section IV-A Thus this aggregate computation mechanism does not result in performance bottleneck at the root of the hierarchy Nevertheless the hierarchy is still vulnerable to single point of failure We can construct multiple hierarchies to alleviate this issue similar to 13  F o r presentation brevity we omit the details Figure 3 illustrates one example of the hierarchy The peers depicted by the squares are participating in netFilter These peers form a hierarchy with four levels Other peers depicted by the dark circles connect to one of the peers participating in netFilter and report their local item sets to them Fig 3 An illustrative example of aggregate computation Multiple peers might simultaneously issue requests for identifying frequent items with different threshold values Instead of forming a separate hierarchy and invoking individual netFilter for each request we use the following technique The requests from different peers are rst forwarded to the root node which then invokes netFilter with the threshold value t set to the minimum threshold value among all the requests that it receives The returned result set is the superset of the result sets for the requests with larger threshold values We can simply form the proper result set for each request from this superset and forwards it to the corresponding peer requesting such a frequent item set In this way multiple requests from different peers are sharing the same hierarchy and netFilter process 2 Computing Aggregates To compute the aggregate for an item or a set of items the peers corresponding to the leaf nodes propagate the corresponding local values to their upstream neighbors A peer representing an internal node merges its own local value for the item\(s under consideration with the values received from its downstream neighbors and then forwards the merged result to its upstream neighbor Eventually the root node has the nal aggregate for the item\(s 3 Updating Hierarchy In most deployed P2P systems peers exchange heartbeat messages with their neighbors periodically to inform the aliveness among each other Here we modify these heartbeat messages slightly by including a DEPTH counter indicating the depth of the message sender in the hierarchy so that they can be used to update the hierarchy upon peer join/leav e/failure To accommodate a new peer participating in netFilter the upstream neighbor and downstream neighbors of the newly joined peer are set up similarly as described in Section III-A.1 The repair of the hierarchy upon peer leave/failure is more complex Upon detecting that the upstream neighbor leaves or fails by the lack of heartbeat messages from this neighbor for a predeﬁned time interval a peer invokes the repair of the hierarchy as follows It rst sets its depth in the hierarchy as 006  In addition the downstream neighbors of this peer are recursively informed to set their depth as 006  When a peer with depth as 006 receives a heartbeat message from a neighbor  P i  with depth  d  P i   less than 006  it becomes a node at depth  d  P i 1 in the hierarchy by setting P i as its upstream neighbor B Candidate Filtering To perform candidate ltering items are rst partitioned into disjoint item groups The aggregates for item groups are obtained through aggregate computation as presented in Section III-A.2 These aggregates of the item groups act as lters to lter out unqualiﬁed items i.e those in the item groups with aggregates below the threshold and retain the items in the item groups with aggregates above the threshold as the candidates We call the items with their global values below the threshold as light items and the items with their global values above the threshold as heavy items  Similarly we call the item groups with their aggregates below above the threshold as light heavy item groups  In the following we rst discuss how items are partitioned into item groups We then discuss strategies for candidate set optimization 1 Item Partitioning Given the fact that a peer only has a partial set of items in the system a solution to partition items into item groups that requires a priori knowledge of the complete set of items in the system would mandate heavy coordination among peers Here a natural solution for item partitioning is hashing  Each of the n items is mapped to one of the g item groups through a hashing function h  x  A\007B  where A and B are the set of items and set of item groups respectively g is referred to as the lter size  Each peer obtains the local values for the item groups as follows It assigns each of its local items to one of the g item groups and increases the local value of the corresponding item group accordingly 2 Candidate Set Optimization Since the aggregate of an item group is the summation of the global values of all the items in the item group some items in the heavy item group might have their global values below the threshold but are retained as the candidates i.e these candidates are false positives There are two types of false positives in the candidate set caused by two different reasons 
37 
39 


1 Homogeneous false positive The global values of all the items in a heavy item group are below the threshold but their summation exceeds the threshold the heavy item group consists of light items only 2 Heterogeneous false positive Some items with their global values below the threshold are grouped into the same item group with other items with global values above the threshold the heavy item group consists of some light items and some heavy items Two strategies are proposed to minimize the number of false positives in the candidate set Strategy 1 Setting the 036lter size properly Small g lter size incurs low communicatio n overhead during candidate ltering but results in a large number of false positives in the candidate set Large g reduces the number of false positives in the candidate set but incurs high communication overhead Therefore we should set g to achieve a nice tradeoff between the number of false positives and the communication overhead incurred during candidate ltering Strategy 2 Applying multiple 036lters To further reduce the number of false positives we apply multiple  f  lters Each lter is deﬁned by a hash function i.e h  x  i 1 001 i 001 f  A\007B i  which maps one of the n items to the set of item groups B i  An item becomes a candidate only if each of the f item groups that it belongs to is heavy Filter 4 23 5 46 7 10 9 8 123 5 46 7 10 9 8 123 5 46 7 10 9 8 123 5 46 7 10 9 8 objects candidates Filter 1 Filter 2 Filter 3 1 Fig 4 An illustrative example of multiple 036lters We use Figure 4 to illustrate an example for multiple lters We apply four lters and obtain four sets of aggregates with one corresponding to each lter The shaded rectangles indicate heavy item groups and blank rectangles indicate light item groups Suppose an item x is hashed by the four lters to Item-groups 1 5 2 and 3 respectively Another item y is hashed to Item-groups 7 5 10 and 1 respectively Since all of the four item groups that Item x belongs to are heavy Item x becomes a candidate On the other hand Item y is pruned since one of the item groups that Item y belongs to Item-group 1 according to Filter 4 is light Note that appropriate settings of f and g are crucial to the effectiveness of netFilter An analysis that derives the optimal settings for them will be given in Section IV C Candidate Veriﬁcation In order to perform candidate veriﬁcation we need to address candidate set materialization i.e generating the candidate set so that peers can compute the global values for these candidates If the root of the hierarchy has a complete view of all the items in the system it can materialize the candidate set by examining the heavy item groups obtained from candidate ltering However in practice the root may not have the complete set of items in the system One possible solution is to perform another aggregate computation to obtain the complete set of items in the system Given the large number of items this aggregate computation is almost as costly as the naive approach and thus it is not feasible We observe that with the list of heavy item groups provided each individual peer can determine which of the items in its local item set are candidates Thus each individual peer can materialize part of the candidate set and obtains a partial candidate set During aggregate computation these partial candidate sets are merged implicitly When we reach the root of the hierarchy we obtain the complete set of candidates and their global values Based on this observation we propose to perform candidate set materialization and aggregate computation for the candidates called candidate aggregate computation n an integrated fashion as illustrated in Algorithm 2 Eventually the root node has the global value for each item in the complete set of candidates exactly It then outputs those items with global values above the threshold as the results Algorithm 2 Algorithm for candidate set materialization and candidate aggregate computation 1 The root propagates the identiﬁers of the heavy item groups downwards along the hierarchy recursively 2 Upon receiving the identiﬁers of the heavy item groups a peer materializes the candidate set according to its local item set and obtains a partial candidate set 3 The peers corresponding to the leaf nodes of the hierarchy start to propagate the pairs of 002 identif ier local value 003 of the items in its partial candidate set to their upstream neighbors 4 A upstream neighbor merges its partial candidate set with the partial candidate sets received from the downstream neighbors updates the values for the candidates accordingly and propagates the merged result upwards along the hierarchy IV A NALYSISOFNET F ILTER In the following we rst derive the cost model for netFilter From the cost model we derive the optimal setting for the lter size g the number of item groups per lter and the number of lters f  We then discuss how to achieve the optimal settings for netFilter in practice For comparison we also derive the cost model for the naive approach where the host nodes forward their local item sets along the hierarchy As we explained before we recruit a set of stable peers to form the hierarchy Thus we expect that th e events of join/leave/failure of the peers in the hierarchy are rare In addition both of netFilter and the naive approach under consideration are based on hierarchical aggregation Therefore we ignore the cost incurred by hierarchy formation and update Table II lists the symbols used in the following discussions Without loss of generality we assume that t is expressed as 002  v in the following discussions where v is the summation over all of the local values of all the items in the system i.e v  001 n j 1 001 N i 1 v i j nd t is 002 fraction of v  We call 002 as the threshold ratio  In addition we assume that we have the values of v and N through simple aggregate computation To obtain v  each peer contributes a single value i.e the summation over all of the local values of the items in its 
38

local item set to the nal aggregate To obtain N  each peer contributes the single value of 1 to the nal aggregate The aggregate computation for v and N can be combined with other aggregate computation since they only need to propagate one single value along the hierarchy respectively TABLE II S YMBOLS Symbols Descriptions N Number of peers in the network n Number of distinct items in the system o

lters s a Size of the value representing an aggregate s g Size of the identiﬁer of an item group s i Size of the identiﬁer of an item Since the main focus of this paper is to identify frequent items at a minimum communication overhead we use the following performance metric in the analysis  Communication cost the average number of bytes propagated per peer Communication cost includes the cost incurred by candidate ltering and candidate veriﬁcation The cost incurred by candidate veriﬁcation itself includes the cost to disseminate the identiﬁers of the heavy item groups to the system and the cost to compute the aggregates for the candidates We refer the cost incurred by candidate ltering dissemination of the identiﬁers of the heavy item groups and candidate aggregate computation as candidate ltering cost  candidate dissemination cost and candidate aggregation cost  respectively A Cost Model for netFilter During candidate ltering a peer propagates the aggregate for each item group Thus the candidate ltering cost is s a  f  g  After candidate ltering the root propagates the identiﬁers of the heavy item groups to the system Thus the candidate dissemination cost is s g  f  w  To obtain the global value for a candidate item each peer propagates the pair of 010 identif ier value 011 for this item Therefore the candidate aggregation cost is  s a  s i    r  fp   We can then derive the total cost incurred by netFilter denoted by C filter as C filter  s a  f  g  s g  f  w  s a  s i    r  fp   1 Note that the same candidate ltering cost is incurred at all the peers except the root node in netFilter the candidate lter cost is 0 at the root node since all these peers need to propagate the aggregates for all the item groups to their upstream neighbors in the hierarchy Similarly the same candidate dissemination cost is incurred at all the peers except the leaf nodes in netFilter the ca ndidate dissemination cost is 0 at the leaf nodes The peers located at the higher levels of the hierarchy have higher candidate aggregation cost However we expect that the total number of heavy items and false positives after candidate ltering is small and thus the total communication cost is not dominated by candidate aggregation cost Putting all together the communication cost incurred at the peers located at the higher levels of the hierarchy is not signiﬁcantly higher than that incurred at the peers located at the lower levels of the hierarchy Therefore netFilter does not impose a performance bottleneck at the root of the hierarchy as mentioned in Section III-A.1 B Cost Model for the Naive Approach We derive the communication cost incurred by the naive approach denoted by C naive  as the details on the derivation are included in the complete version 11  s a  s i   o 001 C naive 001  s a  s i   o   h  1  2 The above result may seem surprising since intuitively we expect that the communication cost incurred by the naive approach is O  n  N   The reason that this cost is smaller than O  n  N  is that a peer only needs to propagate the pairs of 010 identif ier value 011 for the items with nonzero values these items are the union of the items in its own local item set and the items propagated from its downstream neighbors Averaging over all the peers the number of items that a peer needs to propagate is in the order of o  resulting in the above Formula C Optimal Setting for the Size of Filters  g  Given the average global value of light items in the system   v light  in order to avoid homogeneous false positives no more than t  v light items should be hashed to an item group Therefore g should be greater than n   v light t Since t 002  v and v=n   v  we obtain the optimal setting for g i.e g opt s g opt  c   v light 002   v 3 with c as a small positive constant D Optimal Setting for the Number of Filters  f  We argue that the optimal f setting denoted by f opt sthe one that can make the number of heterogeneous false positives denoted by fp 2 ssmallas g  s a s a  s i  At this point netFilter incurs the minimum communi cation overhead denoted by C opt  We rst derive the formula for fp 2 before we explain the reason The number of heterogeneous false positives  fp 2 sthe total number of light items multiplied by the probability of heterogeneous false positives denoted by p fp 2  The total number of light items is  n  r   p fp 2 equals the probability that a light item resides in the same item groups with a heavy item for all the f lters In the following we derive p fp 2 We rst consider a speciﬁc lter i  1 001 i 001 f  The probability that a heavy item resides in one speciﬁc item group among 
39 
41 


the g item groups for lter i is 1 g  and the probability that a light item does not reside in the same item group with this heavy item for lter i is 1  1 g  From this we can then derive the probability that a light item does not reside in the same item group with any of the r heavy items for lter i is 1  1 g  r  Therefore the probability that a light item does reside in the same item group with at least one of the r heavy items for lter i is 1  1  1 g  r  We can then derive p fp 2 equal to the probability that a light item resides in the same item groups with a heavy item for all the f lters i.e p fp 2 1  1  1 g  r  f  Thus fp 2  n  r   p fp 2  n  r   002 1  002 1  1 g 003 r 003 f  4 We now explain why we can achieve the minimum communication cost  C opt  with the optimal f setting  f opt s the one that makes fp 2 as g  s a s a  s i  Since the number of heavy item groups normally is much smaller than the lter size i.e w<<g  the candidate dissemination cost is much smaller than the candidate ltering cost and is ignored in the following derivation With the proper setting on g as discussed in Section IV-C we avoid homogeneous false positives and thus fp  fp 2  Therefore Formula 1 can be simpliﬁed as follows C filter 012 s a  f  g  s a  s i    r  fp 2   5 According to the above fo rmula when we increase f to f opt 1  we increase the candidate ltering cost by g  s a However the decrease on fp 2 will be at most g  s a s a  s i since fp 2  g  s a s a  s i when f  f opt and fp 2  0 when f  f opt 1  We can then derive the candidate aggregation cost decreases at most by  s a  s i   g  s a s a  s i  g  s a  Therefore the communication cost incurred by netFilter when f  f opt 1 is not smaller than C opt  Increasing f further will incur communication cost greater than that incurred when f  f opt 1  On the other hand when we decrease f to f opt  1 the candidate ltering cost decreases g  s a  According to Formula 4 fp 2 increases y times with y  1 1  1  1 g  r  i.e the increase on fp 2 is g  s a s a  s i   y 1  In most cases y is greater than 2  We can then derive the increase on the candidate aggregation cost is greater than  s a  s i   g  s a s a  s i  g  s a  Therefore the communication cost incurred when f  f opt  1 is greater than C opt  Similarly decreasing f further will increase the communication cost further beyond that incurred when f  f opt  1  From above discussion we can see that the communication cost is the minimum when f  f opt  Replacing fp 2 by g  s a s a  s i in Formula 4 we can derive f opt  004 log 1 1  1  1 g  r  s a  s i    n  r  g  s a 005  6 E Setting netFilter Optimally In Practice From Formulae 3 and 6 we can see that in order to obtain the optimal setting for g and f  we need to know  v light   v  n  and r with 002  s a and s i given In the following we explain how to obtain the estimation for these values in practice We perform random sampling to obtain  v   v light n and r  In the following we explain how to obtain  v and  v light  The estimation for n and r are obtained in similar fashion interested readers please refer to 11 for d et ai l s  W e propos e to randomly select a few branches in the hierarchy e.g the peers along the path from the root to the leaf nodes for sampling Each of the sampled peers randomly selects some of the local items from its local item set for which the aggregates are collected from these sampled peers Assume there are x distinct items in the sampled item set and each of such items has an aggregate from the sampled peers as v 001 i  1 001 i 001 x  We estimate the global value of each of such items as  v i  v 001 i  v 001 x i 1 v 001 i as mentioned in the beginning of this section v is the summation over all of the local values of all the items in the system and can be obtained by simple aggregate computation We then derive the estimation for  v light  denoted by  v light as  v light  001 1 002 i 002 x  v i t  v i 001 1 002 i 002 x  v i t 1  7 and the estimation for  v  denoted by  v as  v  001 1 002 i 002 x  v i x  8 V P ERFORMANCE E VA L UAT I O N We rst tune the performance of netFilter by varying the size of lters  g  and the number of lters  f  We then evaluate the performance of netFilter under different settings of data skewness  003  and threshold ratios  002  For comparison we also implement the naive approach and evaluate its performance 5  In the following we rst describe the simulation setup and performance metrics We then present the details of the simulation results The simulation parameters and their default values unless otherwise stated are given in Table III Most of these parameters are self-explanatory More details for some of the parameters are given as follows We use zipf distribution with data skewness parameter 003  to model the distribution of values for items We generate 10  n instances of these items with their frequencies global values following zipf-distribution We then randomly distribute these 10  n items to the N nodes Therefore the number of items on each peer is 10  n N the default is 10  10 5 1000  1000  Without loss of generality we use 4-bytes integers to represent the aggregate values identiﬁers of item groups and identiﬁers of items We use the total communication cost deﬁned in Section IV as the main performance metric To better understand the performance of netFilter we dis tinguish the candidate ltering 5 As mentioned in Section II some st udies 12 obtain a n a pproxim a te set of frequent items and the communication cost incurred is O  a 001  where a is either a constant or proportional to log  n  and 002 is the given error tolerance We do not compare with these techniques since the result set returned in these studies is approximate which is different from our focus here In addition when the given error tolerance is very small the communication cost incurred by these techniques is even higher tha n the cost incurred to obtain a precise set of frequent items using our technique

number of candidates propagated per peer during candidate veriﬁcation and the number of heavy item groups with g varying from 25 to 500 the number of lters is set to 3  For readability the y-axis is on log scale From this gure we can see that when the lter size is very small  001 50  the ltering performance is poor In fact at this range of lter sizes none of the items are pruned Thus the candidate veriﬁcation performs similarly as the naive approach and the average number of candidates propagated per peer during candidate veriﬁcation is in the order of the size of local item set 6  When the lter size increases the ltering performance improves signiﬁcantly resulting in signiﬁcant reduction on the number of candidates propagated per peer When the lter size increases further the

lter size is small  001 50  the number of items in an item group is very large which makes all item groups heavy Thus at this range of lter sizes the number of heavy item groups increases with the lter size When the lter size becomes larger  004 75  the number of items in an item group becomes less resulting in less number of heavy item groups Figure 5\(b shows the communication cost incurred by netFilter under the same setting as for Figure 5\(a We also 6 The reason that this number is smaller than the total number of candidates in this case n  is the same as explained in Section IV-B plot the candidate ltering cost candidate dissemination cost and candidate aggregation cost in the gure The candidate ltering cost increases linearly with the lter size The candidate aggregation cost and candidate dissemination cost are proportional to the number of candidates propagated per peer and the number of heavy item groups as displayed in Figure 5\(a respectively This conﬁrm s our analysis in Section IV-A With above discussion we can easily explain the plot for the total cost in Figure 5\(b The total cost initially increases slightly then decreases signiﬁcantly followed by an increase again When the lter size is very small   100  the total cost is dominated by the candidate aggregation cost This explains the initial increase of the total cost since candidate aggregation cost increases when g 001 50  When the lter size becomes larger  004 100  the improved ltering performance results in signiﬁcant decrease on the candidate aggregation cost When the lter size increases further the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost explaining the latter increase of the total cost Among all of the tested cases the total cost reaches the smallest when g is 100 This conﬁrms our analysis in Section IV-C According to Formula 3 g opt  c   v light 001   v  c is a small positive constant Since 002 is 0.01 and  v light  v is around 0  8  we obtain g opt  c 80  B Effect of the Number of Filters We vary the number of lters  f  from 1 to 10 the lter size is set to 100 and evaluate its effect on the performance of netFilter From Figure 6\(a we see that the number of candidates propagated per peer decreases with the number of lters which conﬁrms the beneﬁts of multiple lters as discussion in Section III-B The major trend observed on the number of heavy item groups Figure 6\(a is that it almost increases linearly with the number of lters which is expected 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 number of filter \(f number of candidates  number of heavy

dissemination cost and candidate aggregation cost When the number of lters is small the candidate aggregation cost is large With the increase of the number of lters the ltering performance improves resulting in reduced candidate aggregation cost On the other hand the major trend observed on both candidate ltering cost and candidate dissemination cost is that they increase linearly as expected The total cost initially decreases then increases When the number of lters is small the total cost is dominated by the candidate aggregation cost The initial decrease is due to the improved candidate aggregation cost With the further increase

on the number of lters the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost which explains the latter increase Among all of the tested cases the total cost is the smallest when f is 3  conﬁrming our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisﬁes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P systems and made the following contributions 1 We identify and formally deﬁne the problem of IFI and discuss how the need of addressing IFI exists in a variety of applications in P2P systems 2 To 100

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
