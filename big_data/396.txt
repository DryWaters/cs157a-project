Seoul, Korea, soohkim@smu.ac.kr Abstract Data Mining & Statistics Analysis is the search for valuable information in large volumes of data. It is now widely used in health care industry. Especially breast cancer is the second most cause of cancer and the second most dangerous cancer. The best way to improve a breast cancer victimês chance of long-term survival is to detect it as early as possible. Currently there are three methods to diagnose breast cancer mammography, FNA \(fine needle aspirate\ and surgical biopsy. The diagnose accuracy of 
mammography is from 68% to 79%, the accuracy of FNA is inconsistent with varying from 65% to 98%, the accuracy of a surgical biopsy is nearly 100%. The procedure of a surgical biopsy, however, is both unpleasant and costly. In this paper, we use a FNA with a data mining & statistics method to get an easy way to achieve a best result We combine some statistical methods such as PCA, PLS linear regression analysis with data mining methods such as select attribute, decision trees and association rules to find the unsuspected relationships 
In addition, the experimental results are shown and discussed 1. Introduction In the last decade, Data Mining & Statistics Analysis has been widely used in health care industry When certain Data Mining & Statistics methods used and valuable information extracted from huge data, it can assist clinicians to make informed decision and improve health service. This paper used a breast cancer database from University of Wisconsin Madison Clinical Sciences Center  The datab as e has abo ut  690 instances used for breast cancer diagnosis. The 
data of the attributes are obtained from FNA procedure first drawing the aspirate, staining the cells and enhancing their boundaries using a computer curvefitting program. The ten physical features of the enhanced cells are documented. So the database uses these ten different attributes to predict two fields: B benign or M = malignant. This paper will do the data preprocessing, data transformation and splits the data into training and testing of data set.  For this procedure, we use training data to build the model and 
use testing data to validate the model. Especially we use some statistics methods such as PCA, PLS linear regression analysis, and data mining methods such as select attribute, decision trees and association rules to find the unsuspected relationships and summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful The data we used has total 699 instances, 10 attributes plus the class attribute: 1. Sample code number, 2. Clump Thickness, 3. Uniformity of Cell Size, 4. Uniformity of Cell Shape, 5. Marginal Adhesion, 6. Single Epithelial Cell Size, 7. Bare Nuclei 
8. Bland Chromatin, 9. Normal Nucleoli, 10. Mitoses 11. Class. And the class distribution is: Benign: 458 65.5%\ Malignant: 241 \(34.5 This approach follows a seven-step process to extract useful information from data: 1. Goal identification,  2. Get a target data set,  3. Data preprocessing, 4. Data transformation, 5. Data mining Statistics analysis,  6. Interpretation & evaluation and 7. Writing report.

relationships among all the attributes\ Unscrambler software for statistical analysis and Weka software for data mining are used in this paper  2. Qualitative Analysis of the Data 2.1 Select Attribute Analysis[3 There are six major attribute selection methods: A Information Gain Attribute Ranking, B. Relief, C Principal Components, D. CFS \(Correlation-based Feature Selection\E. Consistency-based Subset Evaluation, F. Wrapper Subset Evaluation. Because CFS chooses fewer attributes and it is faster and uses smaller trees than the other methods, we used this method. We obtain the running results for method 10fold cross-validation and evaluate on all training data  The results show that the attribute 1\(Sample code number\\(Marginal Adhesion\, 6\(Single Epithelial Cell Size\and 10\(Mitoses\ will not affect the result of class. Attribute 1 does make sense, because the numbers are all randomly assigned. We can eliminate it when we do the following analysis. The other attributes are related to our medicine knowledge  2.2 Principle Component Analysis\(PCA  PCA is a projection method that can help visualize all information from a data table.  It is a good qualitative analysis method. It can help us to find out in what respect one sample is different from another which variables contribute most to this difference, and whether the variables contribute in the same way or are independent of one another  It can also detect sample patterns and quantify the amount of useful information  The principle of PCA is to find the directions in space along which the distance between the data points is the largest  It can also be understood as to find the linear combinations of the initial variables that contribute most to making the samples different from one another Principal Components \(PCs\ined as the directions in space that correspond to the linear combinations of the initial variables which contribute the most to making the samples different from one another. PCs are calculated iteratively and the first PC carries the most information and each subsequent PC carries less information   PCA focuses on the decomposition of the raw data matrix X into a structure part and noise part.  The model can be displayed by the following equation: X TP T E \(T: scores matrix, P T loadings matrix, E: error matrix\.  The idea is to use fewer dimensions to replace a complex multidimensional data set, but still be considered a good approximation to fit the original data closely enough. The first principal components usually carry genuine information while the later PCs tend to describe noise.  Several techniques can be used to ensure that only informative PCs are retained in the model  The equation X = TP T E can be used to calculate principle components  It can be displayed in terms of individual PC contributions: X t 1 p 1 T  t 2 p 2 T  tNpN T E. When the equation is in this form the PC model can be calculated as the sum of outer vector products Here is the running result of PCA Figure 1. PCA running result Figure 2. PCA result - Scores  zoom in The diagram \(Figure 1\ above shows the results for the PCA model for the breast cancer with different classes of class 1 and class 2  The 4 plots shown are scores, loadings, residuals, and explained variance. The scores plot \(Figure 2\shows whether or not the model can separate different samples based on the spectral data.  The data sets here are clearly in 2 groups but with some data points in the area overlapped.  This makes sense because there are 2 different classes in the instances.  Scores plots can be used for outlier detection  An instance that does not fit into any group when the rest of the samples are clearly grouped can be classified as an outlier.  Grouping between instances indicates that classification is possible based on the attribute data and this scores plot for PC1 vs. PC2  Class 2 Class 1 Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Dis tributed Computing and First ACIS International Workshop on Self-Assembling Wireless Networks \(SNPD/SAWNê05 0-7695-2294-7/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


shows that the 2 different classes of breast cancer can be separated based on attribute data   Although the PCA result is not perfect, itês decent and encourages us to do a better analysis with PLS analysis method  3. PLS \(Partial Least Squares\Regression Analysis[5  While PCA modeling only uses the X variable data Partial Least Squares \(PLS\ modeling uses some reference data Y and correlates the X data to the reference data. It performs a simultaneous and interdependent PCA decomposition in both X and Y matrices  The Y-matrix is used directly as a guide for optimal decomposition of the X-matrix.  Past experience shows that PLS modeling can give the most accurate results for quantitative analysis. The Y data here is the class value 1 and 2  The diagram below \(Figure 3\ shows the matrix breakdown for a PLS model. We can define the score and loading complements in X as T and P and an additional loading as W \(loading weights  The score and loading complements for Y are defined as U and Q  Instead of two independent analyses of X and Y, PLS can connect the X and Y spaces directly by specifying the u-score vectors to act as the starting  points for the t-score vectors for the X-decomposition. That means t1 is at first replaced by u1 in the PLS algorithm, which allows the Y-data structure to directly guide the PCA decomposition of X  Likewise, u1 is substituted by t1 at a subsequent PCA \(Y\ stage  It is the Y structure that first influences the PCA \(X\position and then the otherwise ordinary PCA \(X\is carried out  After the X t-vectors are calculated, they are used as the starting u-vectors  By this means, the X data structure now also influences the PCA \(Y\mposition. By balancing both the X and Y information, PLS can reduce the influence of large X variations that do not correlate with Y Figure 3. Principles of PLS After we imported the data in Umscrambler, we can choose PLS1 and produce the result shown in Figure 4  Figure 4. Overview of PLS1 result The diagram above shows the results for the PLS1 model correlating the X- Data to the class Y in the breast cancer database. The four plots shown are predicted vs. measured, scores, loadings and residual validation variance. Letês take a look at some plots and improve the model Figure 5. Measured vs. predicted Y variable Figure 6. Influence plot of residuals A measured vs. predicted figure \(Figure 4\ shows the results obtained from the cross validation  There are two sets of data points for each sample  The blue data points correspond to the calibration set measured reference value and the red data points correspond to the predicted validation value.  The closer the calibration and validation points are a data, the more accurately the model is able to predict  The measured vs. predicted plot for this model showed good correlation between the calibration and validation sets  The correlation coefficient for the calibration set is  Data #41 Data # 41 Data # 649 Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Dis tributed Computing and First ACIS International Workshop on Self-Assembling Wireless Networks \(SNPD/SAWNê05 0-7695-2294-7/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


0.914 and is 0.911 for the validation set  The SEC is equal to 0.193 and the SEP is equal to 0.196  2 PCs were used  Good correlation between the calibration and validation set and a low error of prediction indicates that a model will be able to predict accurately  If some data points are taken out, the model can be improved and SEP can be reduced. For example, data 41 is the furthest plot off the calibration and validation lines and the residuals plot will show that this point may be an outlier.  That means this data point is either not well described by the model or influences the model too much. It may give bias and probably make the model quite useless for prediction  Residual is used to measure the variation that is not taken into account by the model. Leverage is used to measure how extreme a data point is compared to the majority. The plot \(Figure 6\lays the sample residual Y-variances against leverages. It is very useful for detecting outliers, influential data points and dangerous outliers data points with high residual variance. For example, data #41\(we just mentioned above\ lying to the top of the plot, and data #649 lying to the right most of the plot, are likely outliers, or data for which the regression model canêt predict Y adequately. By this way, we take some points out and recalibrate the model. Here is the recalibration model Figure 7. Measured vs. predicted Y variable after some data points taken out Figure 8. : Scores plot after data points taken out The above predicted vs. measured plot \(Figure 7 shows the recalculated model with some data points taken out.  The calibration correlation coefficient improved to 0.955 and the validation correlation coefficient improved to 0.953  The SEC was lowered to 0.139 and the SEP was lowered to 0.141.  From scores plot we can also see the improved result. This scores plot \(Figure 8\ shows clear difference between the two classes. The data points to the left of the straight line belong to class 1 and those to the right belong to class 2  This demonstrates the PLS1 model can separate different data points based on the nine X variables Figure 9. Loading weights Here is a two-dimensional scatter plot \(Figure 9 X- loading weights for the first two principle components from the PLS1analysis. It can be used to detect which X-variables are most important to predict Y. Compared the loading weights value, we can get the following order by its importance to influence Y X6 > X2 > X3 > X8 >X4 > X1 > X7 > X5 >X9 Where  Y  Class \(1 for benign, 2 for malignant\, X1 Clump Thickness, X2: Uniformity of Cell Size X3: Uniformity of Cell Shape, X4: Marginal Adhesion X5: Single Epithelial Cell Size, X6: Bare Nuclei, X7 Bland Chromatin X8 Normal Nucleoli  X9: Mitoses   We can get similar graph from regression coefficients plot \(Figure 10\ regression coefficients can be used to calculate the Y variable value from the X-measurements. The value of the coefficients gives an indication of which X variables have an important impact on the Y variable. Itês a good quantitative analysis method. From the above plot, we can obtain the following linear regression model Y = 0.0253* X1 + 0.0200*X2 + 0.0193*X3 0.0093*X4+ 0.0094* X5+ 0.0534 * X6  0.0180* X7 +0.0146* X8 Ö0.0024* X9  0.7530 Compared with the Select Attribute method, they are matched well. But here we get quantitative result and Select Attribute can only give us some rough qualitative results  One way to get an idea of how well a model can predict is to do predictions in The Unscrambler  The easiest way to do predictions is to create a model  Class 2 Class 1 Class 1 Class 2 Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Dis tributed Computing and First ACIS International Workshop on Self-Assembling Wireless Networks \(SNPD/SAWNê05 0-7695-2294-7/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


without some of the data points  In the Predict option in The Unscrambler, create a sample set with the data points that were taken out of the model  From above prediction result, we can see the model is pretty good and can give ideal prediction result. For 699 data points only 24 prediction results are not correct. The percentage of correctness is 96.57%. For the 24 incorrect results, 16 are incorrectly predicted as class 2\(malignant\en the facts are class 1\(benign\. Thatês better than more results are incorrectly predicted as class 1\(benign\ when the facts are class 2\(malignant We can then get the following Confusion Matrix Class 1 Class 2 442 16 8 233 classified as 1 = benign 2 = malignant 442: the outcome is correctly predicted as class 1 when in fact it is class 1 233: the outcome is correctly predicted as class 2 when in fact it is class 2 16  the outcome is incorrectly predicted as class 2 when in fact it is class 1 8  the outcome is incorrectly predicted as class 1 when in fact it is class 2 4. Decision trees & Association Rules Analysis 6 4.1 Decision trees Decision trees can divide the data points in the training set into disjoint subsets. Each of subsets is described by a simple rule on one or more attributes. A decision tree represents a series of questions \(yes or no The answer to the first question determines what is the next question that will be asked. There is a unique path from the root to each leaf. The path can form an expression of the rule used to classify the data points Here is the running result as following \(Figure 10 Figure 10.Visualization of the Decision Tree Model From the above result  we know that the Number of Leaves is 14 and the Size of the tree is 27 and we can create the following decision rules 1. If Uniformity of Cell Size <= 2 and Bare Nuclei <= 3 Then class = benign \(405.39/2.0 405.39/2.0 means that \(405.39-2.0\.39 = 99.51 records at level 2 are classified as benign and that 2.0/405.39 = 0.49% records at level 2 are classified as malignant 2. If Uniformity of Cell Size <= 2 and Bare Nuclei <= 3 and Clump Thickness <=3 Then class = benign \(11.55 3. If Uniformity of Cell Size <= 2 and Bare Nuclei <= 3 and Clump Thickness > 3 and Bland Chromatin <=2 and Marginal Adhesion  <=3 Then class = malignant \(2.0 4. If Uniformity of Cell Size <= 2 and Bare Nuclei <= 3 and Clump Thickness > 3 and Bland Chromatin > 2 Then class = malignant \(8.06/0.06 5.

Bare Nuclei > 2 and Clump Thickness <= 6 and Marginal Adhesion <= 5  Then class = benign \(5.79/1.0 4.2. Association Rules Association rules are used to find interesting association or correlation relationships among all the attributes. They may predict more than one conclusion For example, if A and B then C and D. The number of records an association rule can predict correctly is called coverage. Support is defined as coverage divided by total number of records. Confidence or accuracy is the number of records that is predicted correctly expressed as a percentage of all instances that are applied to Here the minimum support is 0.5, which means at least 699/2 = 349 records are predicted correctly with certain association rule. And the confidence is set as 0.9, which means at least 90% of instances that certain association rule applies to are correct. Because the association rules can only be used for category variable we have to switch all the numerical data to category data. A represents 1, B represents 2 and so on till J represents 10. From the running result we can get some best rules 1. Size=A nucleoli=A 356 ==> class=benign 355 conf:\(1 If Uniformity of Cell Size =1 and Normal Nucleoli =1 Then class=benign 2. Size=A nucleoli=A mitoses=A 350 ==> class=benign 349    conf:\(1 If Uniformity of Cell Size =1 and Normal Nucleoli =1 and Mitoses =1 Then class=benign 3. Shape=A 353 ==> class=benign 351    conf:\(0.99 If Uniformity of Cell Shape =1 Then class=benign 4. Size=A mitoses=A 377 ==> class=benign 374 conf:\(0.99 If Uniformity of Cell Size =1 and Mitoses =1 Then class=benign 5. bareNuclei=A nucleoli=A 355 ==> class=benign 352 conf:\(0.99 If Bare Nuclei =1 and Normal Nucleoli =1 Then class=benign 6.

Size=A nucleoli=A class=benign 355 ==> mitoses=A 349    conf:\(0.98 Rules 7-10 are not used for classification. They explored some associations among the attributes. It gave us more knowledge about the cancer information 5. Conclusion  This paper explores a standard step to extract valuable information from breast cancer database. It indicates that statistics and data mining techniques can offer great promise in helping us uncover patterns hidden in the data. The best model is often obtained after building several different types of models, or by trying different technologies and algorithms. We have used PCA, PLS1 regression, decision tree, association rules, select attribute techniques to get pretty good results. And these results can be used as reference for doctorês decision-making and organizationês research and so on 6.   References 1 Ma ng asa rian W  N. S t reet and  W  H.

512 The T-norms min produce 2.0 examples of A&amp;B, 0.6 of A&amp;+3, and 0.6 of -A&amp;-B. The corresponding values for the product T-norm are 1.7, 0.3, and 0.3. The measures yield prod I 0.85 I 0.7 I 0.35 I 5.7 I 0.0 1 0.0 As with the data in TI, there is a notable difference between the confdence measures with the two T-norms. There are also differences in the ratio of examples to counterexamples and the interest measures. The analysis of the examples generated by the minimum indicate that the association A =$ B may he of interest. However, with the examples produced by the product T-norm, both of the interest measures are neutral One fnal example considers tuples tuples with no discem able pattem af T m={a,b,p with parameter p .  Setting p to 0 produces the minimum and 1 produces the product. For a particular set of data, the optimal T-norm could he identifed by Ending the value of the parameterp E [0,1] that maximizes the validity measure under consideration. The optimization could use either algebraic or numeric methods, hut the latter seem more suitable for the analysis of large data sets VI. CONCLUSION The determination of the degree that a tuple is an example of a fuzzy rule or association depends upon the underlying relationship between the attributes. In data mining, this re lationship is not known a number of possible methods for determining 'examplehood' should be considered. When the attribute domains are covered or partitioned by the predicates the relationship between joint and marginal distributions im pose restrictions on the suitability of T-norms to evaluate the degree a tuple is an example of an association. The parametric representations of T-norms presents the possibility of simultaneously learning both the relationship between the attributes and the proper assessment of the number of examples and counterexamples REFERENCES I] C.

efficiency then AOFI. However utilization of fuzzy concept hierarchies provides more flexibility in reflecting expert knowledge and so allows better modeling of real-life dependencies among attribute values, which will lead to more satisfactory overall results for the induction process. The drawback of the computational cost may additionally decline when we notice that, in contrast to many other data mining algorithms, hierarchical induction algorithms need to run only once through the original \(i.e. massive dataset. We are continuing an investigation of computational costs of our approach for large datasets ACKNOWLEDGMENT Rafal Angryk would like to thank the Montana NASA EPSCoR Grant Consortium for sponsoring this research REFERENCES 1] J.

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter.

In all cases, we achieve high compression rate \(e.g., the rate is 25% for res=25 evaluate the query efficiency, we first set the resolution to the median value 50, and use the sketch index to answer workloads with various qrlen \(qtlen=10

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
