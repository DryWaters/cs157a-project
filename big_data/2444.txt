Kaliski str., Warsaw 00-908, Poland http://wel.wat.edu.pl  \n \n \nThis paper presents modified method of calculating intensity of electromagnetic nfield in urban areas. Analyses of propagation of spherical waves and \nsimultaneously usage of calculating diffraction and refraction coefficients of \nwaves on obstacles in shape of wedge has been proposed as a method.

Section V gives the related\nwork on network resources optimisation in cloud gaming and\nnetworked games in general and ?nally we conclude this\npaper in section VI by presenting conclusion and some future\ndirections for this work.\nII CLOUD GAMING\nCloud gaming can be de?ned as just executing games in a\nserver instead of users’ devices. In a client-server setup with\nthe cloud gaming paradigms, two main trends exist: Video\nstreaming and game state synchronisation.\nA. Video Streaming\nThe most used solution in industrials cloud gaming sys-\ntems are based on video streaming [2], [6], [3], [7]. In this\ncon?guration, only the server maintains a representation of the\ngame model; the client simply gathers inputs from the user and\nsends them to the server; and receives video from the server\nand displays it to the user’s screen. When launched the client\ncontacts the server to establish the connection and start the\ngame. As explained in [8], usually there are two connections:\none connection to send the user’s controller input to the server\nand one connection to receive the video from the server. The\n?gure 1 shows this game loop.\nFig. 1. Cloud game loop: Video streaming\nThe client game loop run two tasks: the video task and\nthe input task. With the input task, the client polls for input\nevents from the player. When an event is received it is written\ninto a packet and sent to the server. The video task enables\nthe client to receive packets from the server; these packets are\nused to decode the video stream. When a complete frame has\nbeen decoded, it is displayed in the application’s window.\nA typical server game loop also runs two tasks. An input\ntask that receives inputs from the client application and passes\nthose inputs to the game model, and a video streaming task\nthat captures frames from the game, encodes them into a video,\nand then sends the video output to the client.\nB. Game State Synchronisation\nThe client and the server have a representation of the game\nmodel. The client side periodically synchronizes his local game\nmodel with the server side remote game model which is the\ncentral one. This is done by receiving update messages about\nstate change in the game model. This game update loop is\npresented in the ?gure 2. The game usually starts with an\ninitialization stage where all the objects and entities of the\ngame model are initialized. After this phase, the game loops\nbetween the input phase and the update phase. The major\ndifference is that, with this con?guration, the video rendering is\ndone on the client side, and the server just sends state updates\nin smaller packets.\nFig. 2. Cloud game loop: Cloud Game loop: State synchronisation\nIn this paper, we will consider the game state synchro-\nnisation approach as an alternative to video streaming in\ncloud gaming because it does not have strong requirements\non network resources.\nIII. OUR TRAFFIC ADAPTATION APPROACH\nA Main Idea\nIn classical networked game architecture with the cloud\ngaming paradigm, all the game entities of a scene are up-\ndated in a synchronous basis. We aim at optimizing the state\nsynchronization between the client and the server. We make\nthe assumption that there are different synchronization needs\nper game entity. Some need a small update frequency and for\nothers a larger update frequency will be enough. For exam-\nple background entities need less synchronization than target\nentities in a shooting game. We therefore need an ef?cient\nmessage passing protocol that takes this synchronisation needs\nin consideration for better performances. That is why; we apply\na LoD inspired mechanism to prioritize some updates over\nothers.\nB. Level of Detail\nThe LoD technique has been widely used in 3D graphics\nand simulations. The basic purpose of the technique is to mod-\nulate the complexity of a 3D object representation according to\n148\nthe distance from which it is viewed \(or any other criteria   to\nmanage processing load on graphics pipeline while delivering\nan acceptable quality of images. The technique suggests to\nstructure the rendering details of a 3D object in order to\noptimize its processing quality if the object’s visible details are\nproportional to the distance from which the object is viewed.\nFig. 3. Basic concept of LoD: An object is simpli?ed by different\nrepresentations through varying number of polygons [9]\nThe gure 3 presents the rational of Clark: by changing\nthe number of vertices, we see the change in the quality and\nthe visualization of a sphere.\nGeometric datasets are usually too large in data size\nand complex \(in terms of time and computational resource\ndemands process. The LoD approach suggests different\nrepresentations of a 3D object model by varying in the details\nand geometrical complexity. The geometrical complexity of an\nobject is determined by the number of polygons used for his\nrepresentation. The more complex an object is, the more time\nconsuming its rendering will be.\nThe ?gure 3 shows how the number of polygons affects\nthe rendering quality of an image’s graphical representational.\nWith these different representations of a model on hand \(as\nshown in the ?gure3 technique will suggest their\nselection at a particular time point based on certain positive\nselection bias The latter can be their size, camera distance or\nany other criteria.\nThe application of this technique for our work is the ability\nto have different synchronization frequencies for each game\nentity, and select one at a 


particular time based on certain\ncriteria. This way, only more important entities will get the\nmaximum amount of network resources while others get less.\nThese entities can see their communication resources changed\nwhen the network situation changes or when their importance\nin the game changes.\nC. Overview of Our approach\nThe approach maintains a bidirectional multi-level quality\nof service for game entities at runtime. Meaning that the adap-\ntation needs to lessen the game’s communication requirements\nwhen it notices a bottleneck in the network \(materialized by an\nincrease in the response time, or packet loss in case of UDP\npackets an optimal communication frequency\notherwise. This is made possible using organizations.\nHere each entity belongs to a synchronization group \(with\na speci?c communication frequency group. The group assignment for an entity is\ndone according to its signi?cance in the organization The\nsigni?cance of an entity can be de?ned in many different\nways depending of the game designer settings. For this paper,\nwe use the functional importance of an entity in the game as\nsigni?cance.\nD. Organization of Entities\nOur organization model is inspired by the AGR model [11].\nThe AGR \(Agent, Group, Role advocates organization\nas a primary concept for building large scale and heterogeneous\nsystems. The AGR model does not focus on the internal archi-\ntecture nor the behaviour of individual agents but it suggests\norganization as a structural relationship between the collection\nof agents. The AGR model de?nes three main concepts as\nits basis for an organizational structure: agent, as an active\nand communicating entity; a group is a set of agents which\nis de?ned by tagging them under a collection; ?nally a role\nde?nes an agent’s functional representation in a group. The\norganizational model we use in our approach matches the AGR\nmodel as follows:\n• Agent: An agent represents a game entity involved\nin the game scene. Each entity has a signi?cance\nregarding its communication requirements.\n• Role: The role represents the reason why the entity\nis in the game. Each entity in the scene has a role\nand, a role can be shared by several entities. The role\ncan also be used to express entity’s communication\nsigni?cance.\n• Group: A group is a set of entities with the same\ncommunication needs. These entities are synchronized\nat the same frequency. An entity can move from one\ngroup to another at any moment according to the\nobserved network settings and his signi?cance in the\ngame.\nE. Communication Groups\nA communication group is characterized by a communi-\ncation frequency and a score coef?cient \(see score coef?cient\nbelow the group as shown in the ?gure 4. Each update transmission\nuses some communication resources for its completion. We\ndescribe a score coef?cient as an abstract measurement unit for\nthe notion of importance regarding communication resources\nfor weighting entities communication requirements. An entity’s\nscore coef?cient is calculated at runtime using a combination\nof the actual network settings \(here for UDP the packet loss\npercentage network load at running\ntime. This score coef?cient of an entity is computed using\nthe following formula:\nScoreCoefficient = Significance *\nCurrentNetworkCongestion\nThis generic notion of ScoreCoef?cient is a value that\nde?nes whether the entity is important at the current time or\nnot. As the signi?cance of an entity is depending to the game\nrules and the function of the entity, this notion can be exploited\nin many ways. For the game prototype developed in this paper,\nthe signi?cance is a weight de?ned on each role by the game\n149\ndesigner through a con?guration ?le. In case of congestion,\nentities are reassigned to groups.\nF Group Assignment Policy\nThe server side of the game engine maintains a collection\nof communication groups When the game notices a drastic\nchange in network load, the score coef?cient of each entity is\nrecalculated and entities are reassigned to new communication\ngroups if needed.\nAn entity of reference \(E.R trigger the group\nreassignment process for all the entities. The reassignment\nprocess is ordered only if the newly computed expected group\nfor the E.R is different from its current group as explained in\nthe ?gure 4. As general rule for getting the expected group for\nan entity, these conditions must be respected:\n• C1: The entity’s score coef?cient is lower than the\ngroup’s score coef?cient’s threshold.\n• C2: The group is the one with the lowest score\ncoef?cient threshold among the groups respecting the\ncondition C1.\nThis reassignment process is attempted every 5 seconds\nduring the game session.\nFig. 4. Group assignment policy\nThe algorithm 1 shows the group reassignment algorithm\nfor all entities in the game scene.\n1 proposition is a\ngeneric framework that uses as adaptation metric a score\ncoef?cient calculated at runtime The current congestion of the\nnetwork is the main parameter for the calculation of this score,\nand represents the network overhead created by the traf?c load\nat running time. Because our message passing is done using\nthe UDP protocol, as a representative of network congestion,\nwe monitor the packet loss in the network since in case of\ncongestion some packets will be lost. Knowing that with UPD,\nthere is no guaranty on the reception of the packets.\nTo monitor the packet loss at runtime, the server periodi-\ncally sends a number of monitoring packets \(100 packets, one\nAlgorithm 1: Assignment algorithm for all entities\n/* Loop for all entities in the 


game\nscene */\nfor entity in entities do\n/* Compute the expected group of\nthe entity */\nscoreCoef?cient nsigni?cance\(entity entity,\nscoreCoef?cient Add the entity in the\nappropriate group */\nif currentGroup != expectedGroup then\nexpectedGroup.add\(entity entity  client and simply counts the number of\nresponses it receives back. Each missing response is marked as\npacket loss. Thus in case of network congestion, the amount of\npacket loss will increase, and therefore our adaptation scheme\nwill trigger the reassignment of communication groups for the\nentities changing the communication pro?le of the game.\nG. A Short Example\nTo illustrate our approach, here is a simpli?ed version\nof a shooting game, My Duck Hunt, developed to evaluate\nour approach. You will ?nd a more complete description\nin the subsection IV-A. Suppose that we have 3 types of\nentities: clouds, ducks and a reticle. The player controls the\nreticle,let’s say the objective is to point the reticle on the ducks\nand shoot. These entities have different functional importance\nin the game, therefore different signi?cances as de?ned in\nthe subsection III-E. Here the signi?cance is a weight value\nassociated with each entity:\n• Cloud: represents clouds that are moving in the back-\nground. Less important; weight: 1.5.\n• Duck: represents ducks that are ying in the game\nscene. Ducks are the targets. Medium importance;\nweight: 1.\n• Reticle: represents the player’s weapon’s pointer in the\nscreen. More important, weight: 0.5.\nSuppose that we have 3 synchronization groups with dif-\nferent communication rates and score thresholds:\n• Degraded: Less important entities; rate every 100ms.\n• Medium: Semi important entities; rate: every 50ms.\n• Optimal: More important entities, rate every 10ms.\nWhen the game starts and when any drastic change is\nnoticed in the network load, entities are redistributed to the\ngroups.\n150\n• Without LoD: All the entities will always be attributed\nto the optimal group. Their updates will be sent\nevery 10ms and then will evenly compete for network\nresources, therefore will be impacted the same way by\nany network congestion.\n• With LoD: if there is no congestion on the network,\nall the entities will be on the optimal group. In case of\ncongestion, the entities are redistributed to the groups\nusing duck as E.R and the formula in III-E to compute\nentities’ current score coef?cient. So if the groups\nthresholds are well set, the clouds will belong to the\ndegraded group with updates sent every 100ms, the\nducks will belong to the medium group with updates\nsent every 50ms, and the reticle will belong to the\noptimal group with updates sent every 10ms, reducing\nthe overall traf?c load.\nIV. EVALUATION OF OUR ADAPTATION APPROACH\nThe objective of this experiment is to evaluate the impact\nof LoD based adaptation in cloud gaming on the player’s\nexperience. In order to evaluate this impact, we observe and\ncompare the reaction of players during a game session with\nand without the proposed approach.\nA. My Duck Hunt\nThe video gameMy Duck Hunt has been developed to\nconduct this experiment. It is a competitive shooting game\ninspired from the traditional Duck Hunt video game [12]. The\nrules of the game are the following: ?ve kinds of entities evolve\nin the game scene: the reticle, the ducks, the ?amingos, the\ngombas and the clouds. The player controls the reticle and\nshould point the reticle on the target and shut to kill. The\ngame is divided in 5 rounds or waves of ducks. The player\nhas to achieve the following goals:\n• Kill as many ducks as he can. For each duck killed,\nthe player gains points.\n• Do not kill ?amingos.\n• Protect ?amingos from gombas by killing gombas.\nEach ?amingo killed result in point loss.\nThe clouds are background decoration elements. The ?gure\n5 shows a screen shot of the game. Here, the ducks are the\nentities with a black body and a green head. The amingos\nare pink and the gombas are the brown entities on the ?oor.\nB. Participants\nThe test was conducted with 9 participants between 21 and\n30 years old with an average age of 25.33. The distribution of\nplayers based on their playing frequencies; it is given in the\ntable I. Only one participant reported that he does not play\nvideo games. The other participants play games at least one\ntime per week.\nNever 1 per year 1 per month 1 per week everyday\n1 1 2 5 0\nTABLE I. PLAYING FREQUENCIES DISTRIBUTION\nFig. 5. ”My Duck Hunt” video game\nC Protocol\nThe study follows a repeated-measures design. The candi-\ndates have to play two versions of My Duck hunt. One that\nincludes our LoD inspired proposition and the other without\nour proposition. In the later game all the entities are updated\nat the same frequency. The experiment proceeds as follows:\n• The candidates get a quick introduction of the game’s\nrules through a demo version of the game.\n• The candidates play one version then the other \(this\norder is random for all the players difference between the\ntwo versions. During the game, the candidates have\nto report when they perceive any type of bad quality\nof experience or interactivity shortage. They do so by\nholding the space key.\n• At the end of each round, the candidates evaluate the\nquality of experience for the round. They give a mark\nbetween 1 and 5. 1 indicating a bad game experience\nand 5 indicating a good game experience.\n• At the end of the experiment the candidates are\nindividually interviewed and asked to rate the global\ngame experience for each game version by giving a\nmark between 1 and 5.\nD. Network Con?guration and Congestion Simulation\nTo be able to control the 


network environment, the pilot\nexperiment is performed on a Local Area Network. In this\nLAN we have the game server machine, the client machine.\nSince we didn’t deploy the server on a real cloud with WAN\n\(Wide Area Network The proxy is used for network congestion simulation\nthrough delay, jitter and packet loss simulation. The proxy\nforwards all the packets from the client to the server and vice-\nversa. Since we are using UDP connections to send the state\nupdates, the proxy simulates a congested network by ignoring\nall the packets received while a threshold of packets sent per\nsecond is reached. This threshold represents the capacity of\nthe network or the available bandwidth: number of packets\nto forward per second. So to drastically change the network\ncongestion for the game, we just need to change this threshold\nvalue. The proxy is started at the same time as the game and\n151\nit is launched with a con?guration ?le dictating the network\ncapacity variations during the game. This ?rst 210 seconds of\nthis con?guration is given in the table II. From 0 to 30 seconds,\nthe proxy forwards 6000 packets per second; from 30s to 60s,\nit forwards 3000 packets per second denoting a 50.\nTime 0s 30s 60s 90s 120s 150s 180s 210s\nPkts/s 6000 3000 5000 2900 7000 2500 3500 3100\nTABLE II. PROXY CONFIGURATION FOR NETWORK CAPACITY\nThe game server is a Dell Precision M6500 with the\nfollowing con?guration: an Intel Core i7 Q 720 CPU and 4 Go\nof RAM. This is an experimental setup with a mono player\ngame, meaning that the processing cost of the game can be\nhandled by a server machine with these speci?cations. The\nonly bottleneck we have is the one simulated by the proxy\non the network link. The server platform is con?gured with\nthe four following communication groups sorted by other of\nimportance:\n• Optimal group: Entities with the highest communi-\ncation requirements. The update frequency of entities\nhere is 5 ms and the threshold score to stay in this\ngroup is 7.\n• Enhanced group: Entities with relatively high com-\nmunication requirements but lesser than those in the\noptimal group. Frequency = 35 ms, threshold = 15.\n Medium group: Entities with average needs in net-\nwork resources. Frequency = 40 ms, threshold = 70.\n Degraded group: Entities with the lowest communi-\ncation needs. Frequency = 75ms.\nE. Hypothesis\nIn order to evaluate the impact of the proposition we have\nstated the following hypotheses:\n• H.A.0 There is no difference in the game experience\nbetween the two versions of the game during round.\n• H.B.0 There is no difference concerning the global\ngame experience between the two versions of the\ngame.\n• H.C.0 There is no difference in the ratio of time spent\nholding the space key per the session duration between\nthe two versions of the game.\nF. Experimental Results\nWe use the paired t-test to reject the three hypotheses.\nThe statistical analysis was performed using R http://www.r-\nproject.org version 2.15.0. The hypothesis H.A.0 is rejected for\nthe ?ve rounds with p? value < 0.5. The difference between\nthe game experience during each round when using LoD and\nwithout LoD is statically signi?cant. The results of the t-test\nare summarized in the table III.\nThe hypothesis H.B.0 is rejected by the t-test. The differ-\nence of the global game experience between the game with\nLoD based adaptation and the game without LoD is statically\nsigni?cant with a mean M = 1.777778 t\(8 8 p-value\nRound 1 1.2222 4.4 0.002287\nRound 2 1.555556 6.4236 0.0002039\nRound 2 1.666667 3.7796 0.005391\nRound 4 1.222222 3.0509 0.0158\nRound 5 1.666667 3.0151 0.01668\nTABLE III. RESULTS\nThe different in the ratio of the time spent holding the space\nkey per the playing duration between the two game versions\nis statically signi?cant with a mean M = -0.1197444, t\(8 above analysis, we can see the effect\nof our approach on the players’ interactivity with the game,\ntherefore their QoE. In fact all the three hypotheses were\nrejected meaning that the players have perceived a signi?cant\ngain on the game experience with the adaptation technique\nnot only for each round but also for the overall game session.\nThe instability introduced by changing the congestion degree\nat the proxy had less impact on the game quality for all\nthe participants. Finally, these results validate our approach\non improving the overall quality of interactivity of the game,\nshowing that adapting the game traf?c to the available network\nresources signi?cantly increase the perceived quality of the\ngame.\nThis approach is not perfect, one limitation is that, the\nwhole adaptation can be very subjective, since the con?g-\nuration of the platform entity’s weight, score coef?cient\nthreshold this system can result to a very bad player’s QoE.\nIn our work, we suppose that the game designer knows what is\ndoing \(the signi?cance of each entity while this approach\nreduces the bandwidth needed for a good quality game, it does\nnot eliminate the requirement of a minimum bandwidth for an\nenjoyable game. It for sure requires less bandwidth than the\nclassic cloud gaming services.\nV. RELATED WORK\nIn the cloud gaming paradigm, to improve the interactivity\nperformance of a game architecture, two main causes for\ndelays have to be analysed: network latencies and video\nprocessing costs. Several research works have already brought\ncontributions to the optimization of the video processing 


mech-\nanism, in our study we are focusing on network optimization.\nA. Packet Compression and Aggregation\nPacket compression [13] tries to speed up transmissions\nby reducing bandwidth requirements Aggregation is another\ntechnique attempting to reduce the overhead associated with\neach transmission therefore limiting the bandwidth required by\nthe application. Speci?cally, before being transmitted, packets\nare merged in larger ones thus reducing the overhead. Both\nschemes, however, pay the latency bene?ts achieved with an\nincrement in computational costs. Information compressed and\naggregated, needs to be recovered with decompressing and\ndisaggregating algorithms at the receiving end, thus increasing\nthe time required to process each single event.\n152\nB. Interest Management\nTo reduce both the traf?c load in the network and the\ncomputational cost to process each game event, Interest Man-\nagement techniques have been very rewarding 14]. In some\ngame scenario, events generated are relevant only for a small\nfraction of the users. Therefore implementing an area-of-\ninterest scheme for ?ltering events, as well as a multi-cast\nprotocol, could be put in good use to match every packet with\nthe nodes that really need to receive it and, consequently, to\nreduce both the traf?c and processing burden at each node [15].\nGames having interest areas occupying a signi?cant portion of\nthe global virtual environment could hence be further delayed\nif Interest Management schemes would be implemented.\nC. Optimistic Algorithms\nIn order to be less depending on the real responsiveness\nof the network, optimistic algorithms for synchronizing game\nstate at servers can be implemented in order to avoid delay\nperception at destination. In case of lousy interactivity between\nclient and server, in fact, an optimistic approach executes\nevents before really knowing if ordering would require to\nprocess other on the way events ?rst. Game instances are thus\nprocessed without wasting any time in waiting for other even-\ntually coming packets. On the other hand, this performance\ngain is paid with some occurrence of temporary consistency\nloss.\nD. Dead reckoning\nDead reckoning is another method that can help to min-\nimize the effects of latency, but it can also introduce some\ntemporary incoherence between the factual game state and the\nassumed one at the server r [16]. In fact, attempting to limit\nthe bandwidth required by the application this scheme utilizes\na reduced frequency in sending update packets while com-\npensating the lack of information with prediction techniques.\nObviously, predicted movements and actions are not always\ntrustful These eventual restoring actions further impact on\ninteractivity and playability of the game.\nE Games@Large\nIn Games@Large [17], A. Jurgelionis et al., propose a\ndistributed gaming platform for cross-platform video game\ndelivery. The system executes games on a server PC, located\nat a central site or at home, captures the graphic commands,\nstreams them to the end device, and renders the commands\non the end device allowing the full game experience. For\nend devices that do not offer hardware accelerated graphics\nrendering, the game output is locally rendered at the server and\nstreamed as video to the client. The advantage of this approach\nis that the architecture is transparent to legacy code and allows\nall type of games to be streamed. For devices with rendering\ncapabilities, it discharges the server from rendering and en-\ncoding the game output, enhancing the server performance, it\nalso reduce the amount of data to be transmitted since only\ngraphics commands are sent to the client, thus reduces the\ngame latency. For users with low end devices, the latency of\nvideo encoding and video transmission remain the same as in\nother cloud gaming architecture like Onlive.\nThese mechanisms propose enhancements that can improve\nthe performance of a real-time networked game by reducing\nthe traf?c load between the client and the server. Nonetheless,\nthis traf?c reduction introduces some computation expenses\ncontributing to the lag or other incoherence in the game.\nTechniques such as interest management and dead reckoning\nare widely used to reduce both the network load and the com-\nputational cost for a better player quality of experience. None\nof the analysed work has tried to couple the traf?c reduction\nwith a scheduling mechanism for an ef?cient message passing\n\(messages with different importance by\nthe game to the actual capacity of the network. We present\nhere a novel synchronization adaptation technique, speci?cally\ndesigned for ef?cient event delivery in client-server games with\nthe cloud paradigm.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have presented a new network aware\nadaptation technique for game state synchronisation in cloud\ngaming. We tackle the challenges of instability and shortage\nof network resources required to enjoy a classic cloud game.\nBased on LoD principles, our proposed approach uses entities\norganization model in order to minimize the effect of low or\nunstable network capabilities in maintaining game interactivity\nand improving player’s QoE.\nFuture work is to support wider range of signi?cances\nfor an entity. We will need to implement a version of the\nadaptation scheme using a topology heuristics \(distance to\ncamera experimentation in a multi-player cloud gaming\nenvironment where each player has his own network resources,\nhis own camera and sees different angle of the game scene.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.

CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we suggested a network aware Hadoop \nperformance model and explored its scalability with the model. \nOur experimental results showed that the model could predict a \njob’s execution with 5 % average error compared to the real \njob measurement within up to 4 rack 160 server clusters in nresolution of second. We could explain the cause of the real job \nmeasurement pattern under various conditions with the model. \nIn addition, with the model, we explored the Hadoop \nscalability characteristic in large clusters under various inter-\nswitch bandwidths and a numbers of reduces which are \nimportant for the scalability. By using the result, we showed \nHadoop scales out well in the typical cluster network nconfigurations, and suggested guidelines for application design \nand Hadoop scalability improvement. \n A 160 server cluster is a sufficiently large cluster for most \nof newly joined users to big data analysis without sufficient \nbudget for cluster and experience. Our model contributes the \nusers to save cost by assisting to analyzing potential of their \ncluster before adding a new server.  \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] J. Dean and S.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
