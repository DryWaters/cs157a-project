RSenter: Tool for Topics and Terms Extraction from Unstructured Data Debris\nRichard K. Lomotey and Ralph Deters\nDepartment of Computer Science \nUniversity of Saskatchewan \nSaskatoon, Canada nrichard.lomotey@usask.ca, deters@cs.usask.ca \nAbstract—There is enormous volume of user generated content n\(data enhance \nproduct and services delivery. Apart from the open source \ndata, enterprises are also generating a lot of data in-house \nsince modern business requirements are shifting from paper-\nbase to digital records. The major setback however is that, the \ndata is unstructured in the sense that it is in heterogeneous \nformats different file types including multimedia files n\(a.k.a. data mining researchers \nsince it facilitates the representation of topics, term and \ndocument organization in a tree-like structure for human \nreadability. But, the methodology has the tendency of \nintroducing high latency cost. Our work in [38] proposes a tool \ncalled RSenter that searches unstructured data sources based \non algorithms such as: parallelization, linear search,\npessimistic search, and optimistic search in order to generate \nthe hierarchical structure in real time within a search space. \nWe have since extended on the previous work and we report \nthe final version of RSenter with the following functionalities \nfully deployed: 1 NoSQL databases, 2 depth, extracting the entire user \nspecified elements \(topics and terms repository and organize the files in a hierarchical \nstructure regardless of the file formats. \nKeywords-data mining; hierarchical clustering; unstructured \ndata; information extraction; topics; terms; big data \nI INTRODUCTION\nToday’s enterprise attitude towards the data economy \nwhere the transformation of enterprise data from paper-based \nformat into digital assets is strongly preferred has its pros \nand cons. The new data economy which is known as the “big \ndata” era has received warm reception due to ease of data\naccessibility and information consumption across enterprises \n[1-4]. User generated content is also on the increase and ninformation is now more affordable for the deployment of \nrecommendation-based services. However, the enterprise \nlandscape is now faced with the challenges of data \nmanageability. The data is forming at an exponential rate and \nextracting meaningful information out it is a huge problem.\nThe data is becoming debris because it is in unstructured\nformat \(e.g., blogs, comments, emails, multimedia, document \nfiles, etc this prevents previous data mining techniques \nand knowledge discovery in database \(KDD applied. These previous data extraction and retrieval \nprocesses were deployed with structured and schema-based \nstorage in mind [5]. Thus, the study of unstructured data \nretrieval and organization especially textual data mining such as: information retrieval algorithms \nbased on templates [6], association rules [7-8], topic tracking nand topic maps [9], term crawling \(terms    Helmholtz \nSearch Principle [13], re-usable dictionaries [14], and so on. \nOn the whole, most of the methodologies are based on \nNatural Language Processing \(NLP and Linguistics [15-17]. \nIn our initial work which is reported in [38], we proposed \na tool called RSenter1 which performs optimal document \nand content hierarchical clustering. The approach adopted is \naimed at performing topics, terms, and documents clustering \ntasks with the output being sent to a visualization display. \nThe proposed RSenter tool is unique in terms of being a \nsingle tool that achieves topics and terms extraction from \nNoSQL storages, traversing Web contents and hyperlinks \n\(e.g. HTML or XML organization. \nCurrently, these tasks can only be accomplished by \nemploying multiple tools. The success of RSenter is the \ndeployment of a single tool that provides both content \nextraction and hierarchical clustering of terms from textual \nand NoSQL sources. In order to optimize the search time, \ndifferent search algorithms are explored such as \nparallelization, random walk \(or liner search search.\nHowever, the initially deployed work in [38] did not \ninclude some of the above proposed functionalities. In the \ncompleted version which is reported in this paper, all the \nfunctionalities have been deployed and fully tested. \nThe upcoming sections are organized as follows. Section \nII provides an overview of the rise of unstructured data. \nSection III describes some of the attempts that have been \nmade to extract useful information from the unstructured \ndata. Section VI expounds the RSenter architecture and \ndeployment and Section V focuses on the evaluations of the \nRSenter tool. The paper concludes in Section VI with our ncontribution and future outlook. \nII. THE SOURCES OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA TODAY AND \nTHE FUTURE\nAs of 1998 researchers such as Feldman et al. [18][19] \nstarted advocating for the need to devise strategies to mine \n n1 Senter is lamp in Indonesian and the term RSenter is coined from it by \none of our industry partners.   \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big 


Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.59\n395\nvoluminous textual content. In our estimation, today’s \nsources of unstructured data may be different from then. For \ninstance enterprises are converting all existing paper files \ninto digital assets in order to manage physical space What \nwe face today is Big Data. At the keynote session of the \nIEEE 2012 World Congress on Services \(SERVICES 2012 who was a panelist enterprises \nface. Rather, Big Data is any form of data that is \nunmanageable, evolvable, and somehow beyond control. \nThere are other reports which suggest that 80% of the \navailable data is unstructured [15]. We outline some of the \nreasons why unstructured data extraction is challenging \ntoday in the big data era nEvolutionary Data Sources: Most of today’s data has \n“agile schema” or no schema at all with no explicit structure \nof the documents and databases \(e.g. NoSQL resulted into rapid \nchanges in database schema [20].  \nMulti-Source Data Accessibility: The high-dimensional ndata is scattered across multiple sources [21] which makes \ncommunity data mining challenging [22]. In order to merge \ndata from multiple sources, there have been extensive studies \non building mashup frameworks 23-25]. However, the \nchallenge today is not just dependent on how to merge the \ndata from multiple sources but the capacity to merge the \ndata; considering that Twitter alone generates 12 Terabytes \nof unstructured data daily [26].\nHeterogeneous Data Format: Most of today’s \ncommunications are carried out over existing technologies \nsuch as emails, social media collaboration, video clips and \nimaging slides and so on. There are other useful sources such \nas blogs, feedbacks, comments, document files, etc.  \nThe Mobile Age: The mobile driven economy for \nenterprises [27] coupled with the Bring Your Own Device\n\(BYOD 2 medium enterprises are \nadopting; calls for data streamlining for easier accessibility \non resource constraint nodes.  \nFractional Need and Governance: There are instances \nthat only a fraction or specific data may be required in a pool \nof huge data. It is therefore a common practice to filter the \ndata and identify the unused and non-required information \nfrom the data source; but, deleting the data which is not \nneeded is as difficult as acquiring quality data [26]. Another \nbottleneck is the government regulations that govern specific \nenterprises as to the level of information that can be divulged \nto third parties. So, the best approach proposed by some \nresearchers is the data sanitization technique [28]. Data \nsanitization enables certain critical information to be \nhidden/eliminated from a dataset.\nIII. UNSTRUCTURED DATA MINING TECHNIQUES\nUnstructured data mining is now receiving attention from \nthe research community.  In this paper we present the efforts \non information extraction, topics, terms, and clustering. In \nTable I, a summarized overview from [39] is given on the \n                                                          \n2 http://blogs.digium.com/2012/07/06/byod-for-smbs-trends-risks-and-\nbenefits-infographic/   \nstate of the area after reviewing related-works on tools, \nmethodologies and applications.\nA. Information Extraction nInformation Extraction \(IE The \nKDD process [8] considers series of activities including the \nsearch through databases, data warehouse and other \nrepositories where data cleaning and integration procedures \nare performed to remove outliers and so on. Then the cleaned \ndata can be stored in a single data repository where \nknowledge base activities can be performed using data \nmining tools for pattern evaluation. These processes can be \niterative until the final output is given mostly in a graphical \nformat. In most of the existing KDD systems, the assumption \nis that the databases have a schema so data cleaning and \nintegration is straightforward; however, current data sources \nare unstructured so the IE process is required to transform \nthe data sources into a structure or semi-structure before the \napplication of the data cleaning and integration process [6, 8, \n29].  \nThe IE process is community based; meaning, the \ninformation to be extracted is dependent on the need of the \nuser and the available data source. Hence, there is no all-\npurpose IE tool but rather, community-based tools which nsupport specific domain data extraction tasks. For example, \nAl-Zaidy et al. [22] focus on mining data from a criminal \ncommunity. The problem in such systems is the \nidentification of invisible group or individuals in the criminal \nnetwork. Hence, the authors focus on extracting profile data \nfrom available criminal networks The process flow is in this \norder: fetch documents from a storage repository \(HDD perform normalization of names, extract \ncorresponding prominent communities \(i.e., city, contact, \nand text summarization on the extracted text linkages\nto the communities, and visualization of the criminal \nnetwork. Also, the challenge of language barriers has \ncompelled researchers to opt for the deployment of language \nspecific IE tools [16, 30]. As already hinted, there are quite a \nnumber of community-based works; some reported by \nZaiane et al. [31] who focus on DBLP database by trying to \nidentify the social relationships between the researchers \nwithin the community, and Segall et al. [32] who employ \nSAS Text Miner and Megaputer Polyanalyst to analyze hotel 


ncustomer comments in a Web content. Also, LIPTUS [33] is \ndeveloped to merge structured and unstructured data in a \nbanking community while MEDREADFAST [34] performs \nsimilar functionality in a clinical community.\nB Topics \nTopics tracking is generally employed to recommend \nsubjects of interest to a user. Most online subscription \nsystems \(e.g., hotel booking, flight, news articles etc where keywords are extracted \nfrom users’ subscription to form a basis for the users’ \ninterests [9, 11 Based on these key words, a mechanism of \ngrouping the related keywords \(called Lexical Chaining employed to extract subsequent published messages [9].\n396\nTABLE I.

Terms \nTerms are different from topics in the sense that the focus \nof term crawling is to establish a network of associative \nrelationships between features [9]. The features in this case \ncan be any artifact The main benefit of term mining is that, \nit optimizes the search space vector thereby reducing \nprocessing time instead of going through the entire document \nas required for topics extraction [18-19]. Further, term ncrawling indicates the relevance of information gathered in \nan unstructured document. The term extraction module \nproposed by [19] performs Linguistic Preprocessing, Term \nGeneration, and Term Filtering. Also, the metrics proposed \nfor terms evaluation is based on the estimation of term \nfrequency, relative frequency variation of a term, and inverse \ndocument frequency \(tf-idf Document Clustering \nDocument clustering as explained in the works of [9] and \n[11] is a way of sub-categorizing documents into closely \nrelated identities. This requires a degree of similarity \nbetween the documents, or topics, or terms. The concept of \nclustering can be divided into two: K-means clustering and nHierarchical clustering. The reader is referred to [9] for \nfurther reading on the details of the various methodologies. \nBut, the K-means clustering is criticized for the formation of \npoor clusters and it can be resource intensive. Hence, the \nhierarchical clustering is proposed to overcome the \nbottleneck in the former methodology. The hierarchical \nclustering further supports clustering tree formation for \nhuman readability The hierarchical clusters can be formed \nfollowing the bottom-up approach or the top-down approach.\n397\nFile and Document\nRepository\nDocument\nOrganization\nKeyword\nExtraction\nTopics Terms\nSearch\nAlgorithm\nNoSQL\nLinear\nP\nes\nsi\nm\nis\ntic\nO\npt\nim\nis\ntic\nPa\nral\nlel\nSerializer\nHyperlinks\nClustring nData\n\(JSON Clustering\nUnstructured\nData Source\nThesaurus Dictionary\nThesaurus Engine\nAdaptive Engine\nFigure 1. The RSenter Architecture\nThere have been some innovative proposals for the \nimplementation of hierarchical clusters. For example, [9] \nexplains the use of multiple dictionaries with split algorithms \nto form clusters contrary to earlier methodologies that use a \nsingle algorithm on a single verbose dictionary. Also, \nMohanty 


et al. [35] proposed the an algorithm for \nhierarchical clustering called Balanced Iterative Reducing \nand Clustering Using Hierarchies \(BIRCH n parallel cluster generation to optimize the clustering \nformation process. \nIV. RSENTER ARCHITECTURE\nThe RSenter tool performs the following tasks: 1 ndocument \(e.g., XML and RTF e.g., Hyper-\nlink traversal e.g., CouchDB, Amazon S3 etc provides visualization outputs \nfor the extracted artifacts.\nIn order to achieve the above functionalities the \narchitectural overview of RSenter is shown in Fig. 1. The \nentire implementation is C# based with the output being \npassed to an HTML5 interface.\nTo commence the search process, the user is required to \nprovide a Search Criteria. This tells the framework as to \nwhether the user wants to perform topics and terms nextraction or document organization task.\nKeyword Extraction: We describe our IE process as \nkeyword extraction. Technically, RSenter supports both \ntopics extraction and terms crawling. When the intention of nthe user is to perform keyword extraction activity, the \nThesaurus Engine is activated. The thesaurus engine ncomprises of two components; the dictionary and the \nthesaurus. Since RSenter is a community project \(i.e it is \nspecifically built for our industrial partners pre-populated with features \n\(keywords organization. These keywords include contract \nrelated terms, employee records, payment transactions, and \nso on. The reason for the thesaurus is also to avoid \nchallenges with keyword identification that arises as a result \nof semantic issues in data mining. The thesaurus may contain \na keyword before the time of extraction or the keyword may \nbe added at the time of extraction. The dictionary component\ncontains standard words lexicon user-specified artifacts and their possible \nsynonyms when those artifacts are not found in the \nthesaurus nTopic extraction in RSenter assumes the user wants to \nextract a particular element or predefine jargon or word \nwithin the unstructured data source. Terms extraction on the \nother hand involves the extraction of words and their \nsynonyms. Thus, terms extraction facilitates the organization \nof topics into a structure and shows their dependencies. For \ninstance, in the thesaurus, the term “employee” may be \nrepresented as employee: “payroll”, “profile”, “employment \ncontract”]. Hence, the extraction of employee data from the ndata source will include all the information in the tuple as \ndefined in the thesaurus. \nThe importance of implementing the thesaurus engine is \nalso to aid us perform topic tracking and repetition of topic \nand term extraction activities. We achieve this goal by \ndeploying an adaptive engine which remembers previously nsearched terms.\nDocument Organization: This search is performed when \nspecific documents and files are being searched in a \nrepository. Document search is not dependent on the \nthesaurus; rather, RSenter directly calls the search algorithm \ncomponent to perform the search for the specified \ndocuments.  \nUnstructured Data Sources: This is the data source that \nrequires the information extraction process. RSenter is able \nto search through multiple data sources such as NoSQL \ndatabase \(e.g., CouchDB, Amazon S3, MongoDB, Cloudata, \netc entire websites \(with hyperlinks e.g., XML textual sources \nin single files such as PDF and RTF. \nSearch Algorithms: The moment the search criteria are ndetermined and the user chooses to perform topic extraction, \nterm extraction, or document search, the search algorithm \nengine is activated. The search algorithm is applied directly \nto the unstructured data source based on the user’s search \npreferences. Actually, we proposed the following search \nalgorithms: parallel search, random \(linear search algorithms in order to examine the best \nmethodology that meets our need; especially, optimization of ninformation extraction time. Thus, the current RSenter \nversion which is in use employs the parallel search nmethodology since it’s the most reliable based on our \nevaluation indices \(to be discussed later in the next section methodologies determine the depth of \nthe unstructured data and traverse the layers from top to \nbottom. For example, considering a hyperlink of HTML \ndocuments as illustrated in Fig.2, for each methodology, the nextraction process starts from the root which is node 1. \nFigure 2. Directed graph \nSearching through node 1 shows that there are existing \nexternal links that are nodes 2, 3, and 4. The search then \ncontinues with each child node of the root until every node is \nvisited. Also, with the directed graph, we adopt the hyperlink nsearch model from [5] where we keep two attributes \(i.e., the \nNodes and Link These attributes \nare represented as tuples in an array such that Nodes = [url, \ntitle, format, size, date topic or term \(text  Random 


This is the commonest \nalgorithm on which most existing data mining tools are built; \nprobably because it is straightforward to implement and it \nhas a complexity cost of O\(n entire vector \(search root after the other. So in Fig. 2, the linear search from \nthe root will consider child nodes 2, 3, and 4. Then it will go \nto node 2 and will reach a dead-end. After which it will go to \nnode 3, and will also determine that node 5 is a child of node \n3. It will then visit node 5 and determine child nodes 6, 7, 8, \nand 9. It will further search through these individual child \nnodes and reach a dead-end in each case. After that, it will ncome back to node 4 and determine that node 8 is a child of \nnode 4. But, in this case, it will not visit node 8 because it \nhas already visited node 8 when it traversed node 3 and node \n5 links. This measure of not visiting an already visited link \nmakes the search not to enter into an infinite search loop. \nSimilarly, the algorithm can be described as a recursive \nsearch algorithm because of how it searches through the \nlinks and determines which node to visit next from the \ncurrent node.  \nFurther, we refer to the model as random because the \nsystem determines which child node to visit without user \nintervention. For instance, the choice of traversing node 2, 3, \nor 4 as the first choice follows no particular order. The only \ncriterion is every child node must be visited.  \nParallelization: Our proposed parallel search employs \nthe linear search in two concurrent functions but randomness \nis not permitted. Since the search is in a directed graph, the \nsearch for topics, terms or document starts from the root \nnode and depending on the number of child nodes, two nconcurrent functions are called that divides the search space \nby numbering nodes as even and odd. Assuming the entire \nvector space is N with layers such that N = {1, 2, 3… n}.\nThen, for each layer two linear functions, X and Y are called \nsuch that, X = {search through odd numbered nodes of N} \nand Y = {search through even numbered nodes of N}. So, \nfor every node that has more than one child node, the linear nfunctions X and Y will be activated in order to halve the \nsearch space vector in the previous linear search algorithm. \nAfter all the layers in N are visited and the topics, or terms, \nor document are extracted, the Serializer component is \nactivated which combines all the search terms into a single \nextracted document structure just as the linear search. In the \nRSenter architecture, the serializer works only with the nparallel search in order to integrate the results from the \nsegregated functions. That is, combining the array values of \nthe various search results into a single array with duplicates \neliminated.    \nIn order to explain the concept of the parallel search \nfurther to the reader using Fig. 2, we can say that N = 4 \nlayers counting from the root node \(i.e. node 1 nodes \n\(i.e., nodes 2, 3, 4 search node 3 and \nfunction Y will search node 2 and 4. Node 2 is a dead-end \nand node 4 has a child node 8 so the Y function will be \ncalled to search through node 8 \(since its only one node and \nwe treat one node as odd child. The search space in node 5 will be \ndivided among X and Y again since the child nodes are more \nthan one. X will search node 6 and node 8, and Y will search \nnode 7 and node 9. Now there are two cases to explain here. \nThere is the repetition of searching through node 8 because \nthe initial search was done by Y and in the second case, the \nsearch is being carried out by X. So, during the serialization \nof the results, the duplicate nodes will be eliminated.\nHowever, assuming the use case is different and Y initially \nsearches through node 8 and then based on the search space \ndivision between X and Y at node 5 it happens that Y is nassigned to node 8, the search will not be carried out all \nbecause Y already knows that it has visited 8. It works just as \nthe linear search algorithm and this further saves cost \(time Search Algorithms:\nPessimistic and optimistic constants have been employed \nextensively in software engineering to accomplish tasks such \nas the detection of the existence of software artifacts in \nsource code traceability link detection, bug triaging and \nfixing, and so on [36]. The pessimistic search assumes that nthe search term may not be found based on some probability \nwhile the optimistic search is the reverse. The reason we \nfound the pessimistic and optimistic search relevant to our \nwork is because we employ it to search for the existence of \ntopics, terms, and documents in the unstructured data source \nbut not necessarily the links and the dependencies of the \nkeywords. In essence, the pessimistic and optimistic search is \na linear search but with restrictions as to which sources to \nsearch or not. For example, looking for employee “Richard nLomotey” from a pile of digital files, the pessimistic search \nwill ignore all nodes \(files nothing to do with \nhuman resources \(HR in HR related documents \n\(i.e., if that is how the user search criteria settings are search is not going to go through all the nodes \nfor example in Fig. 2 if the algorithm assumes that the topic ncannot be found in node 2 or 4 or some other node. The \nsearch is user specified hence, the user has to 


provide the \nsearch term and also provide the document names or files or \ndirectories that should not be searched. The optimistic search \non the other hand is when the user provides a search term; \nand then specifies files or directories in which the user thinks \nthose search terms can be found.\nFigure 3 Visualization clustering tree showing the result for the search \nterm “R. Lomotey” who is an emplyee. RSenter searched through all the \nunstructured data debris and classified the data based on the depth of the \nspace vector. The yellow label shows the link that is being traversed. \nHierarchical Clustering Data and Visualization: After the \ninformation extraction process is complete based on the \nadopted search algorithm the extracted result is modeled as \nJSON data. The extracted information is an array so it can \nbe saved in a NoSQL database \(e.g., CouchDB JSON data provides topic clustering, term clustering, \nand document clustering. Currently, the RSenter output nrelies on the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit [37] to display \nresults. Fig. 3 is reproduced from [38] showing an output of \na search term through unstructured NoSQL and textual \nsources.\nV. EVALUATION METRICS\nWe conducted two major experiments in this work. \nFirstly, we repeated the experiment in [38] to be sure that the \nfinal version of the tool can produce the same result; and \nsecondly, we conducted terms extraction over hyper-links. \nWe deployed RSenter on our Window based system with the \nfollowing specifications: Windows 7 System 32, 3.20 3.12 \nGHz, 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD. We considered a training data \nset of 1 million entries in a NoSQL database \(CouchDB divided into 48 categories with \nsubcategorized data of approximately 21000 data sets. For \ninstance, we have categories and sub-categories organized \nas: [HR: Employee Records, Terminations, Promotions, \nHiring], [IT Employees, Duties, Deadlines, Deliverables], \n[Admin: Payments, Clients, Contracts], and so on. On the naverage, the hierarchical depth of the search space is 7 \nlayers. In order to further generalize the evaluation result \nespecially regarding a search through hyperlinks, we \nconsidered 3000 gas and mineral mining and related \nwebsites from the North American and European regions. \nWe have approximately 33000 links to traverse in this case \nin order to extract a mining related search term. The entire \nevaluation focused on term extraction because we considered \nit as an advanced form of topic extraction with dependencies.\nWe evaluate the framework based on the training data set\nfrom the NoSQL and provide the overall overview of the nexperimental result in Table II.

The TP value of the \npessimistic search is 80.27%, far less than the other \nalgorithms because, sometimes the user specifies directories \nthat should not be searched but in reality, those directories \ncontain the required data. This has also affected the other \n400\nmetrics as shown in Table II. The optimistic search has a \nhigh TP because we are certain of the directories to search \nbased on previous usage. However, the TP value of the \noptimistic search is less than 100% because we overlook \ndirectories that may contain the terms but were not specified nduring the search. Further, we achieved 100% precision, \nrecall, and specificity, and accuracy in the case of the parallel \nand linear algorithms because we have the FP and FN values \nas 0%. \nNext, we evaluate the time for traversing the entire \ndataset for the NoSQL \(Fig. 4 Fig. 5 approximate number of vocabularies in the \nthesaurus that we focused on extracting is 40000. Fig. 5 on \nthe other hand focuses on the extraction of terms on types of \ngas projects from the 33000 hyperlinks traversed nFigure 4. Document Search Time \nFigure 5. Traversing Links \nIn Fig. 4, it takes approximately 53.68 minutes on \naverage to extract 40000 vocabulary-based terms from the 1 \nmillion unstructured NoSQL documents when the linear \nsearch is employed. The documents involve semi-structured \ndata and document files as attachments etc For the same \ndata set, our parallel algorithm accomplishes the search task\naveragely in approx. 21.49 minutes. This means the \npercentage cost saved in terms of search time is 149.78%.\nThis is a marginal improvement on the initial version.\nIn Fig. 5, which has to do with terms extraction from \nHTML documents across 33000 hyperlinks online, the linear \nsearch time is averagely 40.5 minutes. The parallel search is naveragely 21.82 minutes which translates into a saved cost of \nprocessing time of about 85.7%. In both Fig. 4 


and Fig. 5, we \ndid not evaluate the optimistic and pessimistic search \nbecause the two are dependent on the user’s specifications. \nSo, a user can decide to search through a fraction of the \ndocument or the full document. Since there are multiple \nsearch preferences for users, it is difficult for us to capture \nresults that can reflect a user’s behavior. But, since the two \nalgorithms are also linear dependent, the points on the linear \ngraph gives a hint of the approximate search cost in terms of \nthe time required to search through the units of documents or \nhyperlinks.  \nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe modern data economy is plagued with the challenges nof unstructured data mining. This is because the existing data \nmining techniques are designed and developed for structured \ndata sources with well-defined schema and data \nhomogeneity. However, the new era is full of varying data-\nformats which have no particular schema. Unstructured data \ncomes in different forms such as textual, NoSQL, \nmultimedia files, documents, etc. Further, these documents \nare scattered across multiple platforms.\nRSenter focuses on data extraction from NoSQL sources, \nfile systems, and network of hyperlinks Specifically, we \nbuilt a thesaurus that contains human resource information, \ncontracts, partner information from the gas and mineral \nmining sectors, procurement, and so on. Users can extract \ntopics, terms, and documents; and the output is presented as \na hierarchical clustering tree. \nThe RSenter framework is built and tested based on the \nfollowing algorithms: parallel search, linear \(random optimistic search. Currently, the \ndeployed version is running on the parallel algorithm \nbecause it is deemed by our industrial partners as the most \nreliable algorithm. When made open source, RSenter can be \nadopted by any community through the modification of the \nthesaurus. The future direction of the project is to incorporate \nan adaptive learning component that could lead to automated \nsearch and the deployment of a reasoning system.  \nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

the effects of different recommendation radii on the\nperformance of the four schemes in terms of the average\nactual detour ratio from 8AM to 9AM of a weekday. We in-\ncrease the recommendation radius from 50 meters to 250\n446\n9meters, which increases the size of potential taxicabs that\ncan be recommended. Heuristic is not affected by such an\nincrease, since it only recommends the closest taxicab. Ran-\ndom is not signi?cantly affected, since it recommends a\ntaxicab based a random selection. But with the increase of\nradius, both Advanced and Basic have better actual detour\nratios, because a large recommendation radius gives them\nmore taxicabs to select for a better recommendation. Also,\nwith the increase of radius, Advanced always outperforms\nBasic, which con?rms our observations in the previous\nsubsections.\n2 Different Radii: Figure 16 shows\nthe effects of different recommendation radii on percentage of\nreduced total mileage from 8-9 of a weekday. With the increase\nof the radius from 50 meters to 250 meters, the performance of\nboth versions of CallCab increases, while those of Random\nand Heuristic stay the same. But when the radius is close to\n250M, the increase for both versions of CallCab slows down,\nwhich is because the radius is large enough to have a suf?cient\nnumber of taxicabs for recommendations, and an even larger\nradius would not help.\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nW\nai\ntin\ng nT\nim\ne\n\(%\n 5\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nct\nua\nlD\net\nou\nr\nR\nat\nio\n\(%\n Detour Ratio VS. Dataset\nE. Percentage of Reduced Waiting Time\nIn this subsection, we show the percentage of reduced\nwaiting time due to carpooling in Figure 17. Because the\nmethod we use to calculate waiting time is based on taxicabs\npassing locations of pickup events, we present the percentage\nof reduced waiting time from hours 8 to 20 of a weekday,\ndue to the high densities of taxicabs and pickup events. Dur-\ning rush hours e.g., from 8 to 10 A.M., all systems with\ncarpool services reduce the waiting time by as much as 63%\non average. Heuristic outperforms the rest because it recom-\nmends the closest occupied taxicab for carpooling service,\nand other systems perform similarly to each other. In short,\ncarpooling services can signi?cantly reduce passenger’s\nwaiting time, when regular taxicab services are not suf?cient.\nF. Impact of Insuf?cient Datasets\nIn this subsection, we evaluate CallCab when there is no\nsuf?cient dataset for analysis. Figure 18 shows the perfor-\nmance of CallCab in terms of detour ratio in one rush hour\n8AM to 9AM of a weekday with the maximum recommen-\ndation radius, when one to ?ve days of dataset are used for\nanalysis. We observe that even though with only a dataset of\none day, CallCab still achieves satisfactory performance,\ne.g., Advanced and Basic achieves a 16% and 28% detour\nratio, respectively. When more datasets are available, the\nperformance of both versions of CallCab becomes better.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we analyze, design, and evaluate a recom-\nmendation system CallCab for both carpooling and regular\ntaxicab services in large-scale taxicab networks. CallCab\ndata mines taxicab trip distributions from historical GPS\ndatasets collected in an existing infrastructure, and recom-\nmends either a vacant taxicab with no detour distance or a\ncarpool route with a small detour distance. We employ a\ngeneric MapReduceMeasure model to ef?ciently tackle the\nraw GPS dataset to obtain recommended taxicabs. We verify\nCallCab with a real world dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and\nresults show that compared to ground truth, CallCab can\nsave the passenger’s initial wait time and fare, by decreasing\nboth 64% of the total mileage and 63% of the passenger’s\nwaiting time, leading to a faster and affordable service.\nIX.

3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
