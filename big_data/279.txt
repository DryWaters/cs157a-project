summarizes network behavior from a packet stream This information is fed into intrusion detection methods such as association rule mining outlier analysis and classiﬁcation algorithms in order to characterize network behavior However current feature extraction methods based on per-ﬂow analysis are expensive not scalable and thus prohibitive for large-scale networks In this paper we propose an accurate and scalable Feature Extraction Module FEM based on sketches We present the details of the FEM design on an FPGA and show that using FPGAs we can achieve signiﬁcantly better performance compared to existing software 
and ASIC implementations Speciﬁcally the optimal FEM conﬁguration achieves 21.25 Gbps throughput and 97.61 accuracy 1 INTRODUCTION Traditionally intrusion detection techniques fall into two categories signature or misuse detection or anomaly detection Signature detection looks to nd well-known patterns of attacks and intrusions by searching for pre-classiﬁed signatures either in network trafﬁc or data patterns Since general-purpose processors i.e software implementations cannot meet the required performance limitations numerous projects have investigated dedicated hardware including re 
conﬁgurable hardware for such tasks 1 2 3 4 Anomaly detection which is designed to capture behavior that deviates from the norm is the counterpart to signature detection These systems predict anomalous behavior Hence they can detect new/unknown intrusions However they suffer from false alarms false positives and also not sounding alarms when attacks do occur false negatives 6 S i nce t he number o f n e w at t acks i s i ncreas i n g a nd v a ri ations of old attacks are more prevalent next generation IDSs must employ anomaly detection Regardless of the underlying algorithm the rst step in 
anomaly detection is the realtime network feature extraction Due to the complexity of gathering detailed information in high speed links existing techniques only monitor a small amount of features in a packet stream limiting their effectiveness Feature extra ction mines more information than is readily available at the packet level Besides the packet payload a single packet does not offer much information Yet by processing a series of packets one can mine for additional characteristics of the network activity between hosts Our architecture allows for characterization of a sud 
den increase network activity This information is needed for anomaly detection algorithms such as rule mining classiﬁcation and outlier detection In this paper we propose a Feature Extraction Module FEM FEM accurately characterizes network behavior and always provides an up-to-date view of the network environment Depending on the application utilizing this information e.g rule mining classiﬁcation different properties get monitored in the network As we will describe in the following sections our architecture can be easily conﬁgured to gather such different types of information By utilizing 
the reconﬁgurable capabilities of FPGAs these changes can be effectively performed Because of such conﬁguration and high performance requirements FPGAs are an ideal implementation medium for their reconﬁgurability and inherent parallelism Our simulation results prove the sketch data structure a viable alternative to expensive per-ﬂow methods In addition our FEM implementation requires a constant amount of memory and achieves a guaranteed performance level important characteristics for networking hardware design This paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents a 
background of feature extraction measures and an introduction the types of attacks plaguing many networks Section 3 presents the FEM architecture and its components Section 4 demonstrates the applicability of our architecture Simulations and FPGA implementation are diagrammed in Section 5 Then related work is shown in Section 6 with conclusions 0-7803-9362-7/05/$20.00 ©2005 IEEE 438 


in Section 7 2 BACKGROUND Our architecture is a necessary precursor for online anomaly detection Although FEM can be conﬁgured to gather information for any anomaly detection scheme in this paper we focus on detecting two of the most popular network attacks denial-of-service DoS attacks and port scanning a mechanism in worm propagation A majority of DoS attacks are SYN oods which send connection requests faster than a machine can process them The well-known TCP 3-way handshake is below sends a SYN segment with client’s ISN Initial Initially the attacker creates a random source IP for each packet with the SYN ag set to request a new connection The victim responds with a packet having the SYN and ACK ags set and then waits for a conﬁrmation packet which will never arrive Typically connection tables wait a period of time before dropping the entry In this time the victim is bombarded with SYN requests and the table lls up As a result the victim refuses any additional connection requests even if they are legitimate Typical SYN ood behavior involves a large amount of packets with the SYN ag set directed at a victim Port scanning on the other hand is probably the most common and versatile type of intrusion mechanism For example with worm propagation in order to distribute copies of itself the worm must nd other hosts vulnerable to it Worms may target a speciﬁc host or search for any number of hosts We classify three well-known port scan methods vertical scan horizontal scan and block scan 7  H o ri zontal scans are the most common scanning a range of IPs on a particular port The port number is often unique as it reﬂects the susceptibility the worm is exploiting Vertical scans target a speciﬁc host and search for open ports on that host The third scan type block scan is a combination of horizontal and vertical scans for different ports and machines Fortunately port scanning requires a real source IP address instead of a spoofed one Therefore it is possible to track port scan behavior from the source IP address 3 FEM ARCHITECTURE In this section we introduce the feature extraction module FEM which characterize s network behavior within an interval of time or speciﬁed interval of connections Network behavior represented by the FEM sufﬁciently reﬂects the current state of the network Thus real-time proﬁle of the network is always available for processing with intrusion detection schemes such as data mining outlier analysis statistical methods etc 9 The architecture’s data storage component models the idea of sketches 10  w hich are u s e d i n d ata s tream modelling for summarizing large a mounts of information requiring a small constant amount of memory Sketches are a probabilistic summary technique for analyzing large network streams without keeping per-ﬂow state that make vector projections onto other sketches to infer additional information Our case study will show how the relationships between sketches aid in inferring add itional network characteristics that are not explicitly monitored To achieve fast execution and to achieve effective adaptation we implement our architecture on an FPGA The regular structure of sketches maps well onto an FPGA We exploit the inherent parallelism in the sketch to increase throughput and obtain signiﬁcant link speeds It is possible to model anomalous behavior associated with two general types of intrusions time-based and connectionbased Time-based attacks cause an increase in network activity in a period of time referred to as bursty attacks SYN oods are an example where connection tables are ooded in a period of time disabling the victim machine to service new connection requests Connection-based attacks do not have a recognizable temporal aspect They are sometimes referred to as pulsing zombie attacks Port scans may release connection requests in the span of seconds or days Therefore intrusion detection methods focusing on large volumes of network activity are ineffective Our architecture can capture both connection and time-based statistics 3.1 FEM Functions There are two main functions supported by the FEM UPDATE k v to change the value in the sketch ESTIMATE k to correctly retrieve a value from the sketch Both functions take in a key k which is input to H hash functions in the feature sketch The key k in this case is any combination of the 5-tuple elds present in TCP/IP packet headers source IP destination IP source port destination port protocol The 6-bit ag eld also in a packet header assists the control logic for intelligent hashing of the 5-tuple elds depending on what network characteristics are analyzed 3.2 Architecture Figure 1 highlights our architecture consisting of a comprehensive feature controller FC hash functions HF feature sketch FS and a data aggregate DA The FEM architecture provides a fast scalable and accurate platform from which important network characteristics can be monitored and tracked in real-time FEM can be conﬁgured to monitor a plethora of network characteristics by using the semantics of the TCP/IP protocol Also FEM requires a small memory 439 


Feature Sketch \(FS H x K Fig 1  Feature Extraction Module with one Feature Sketch footprint while main taining a high level of accuracy making it an attractive alternative to expensive per-ﬂow methods The feature controller FC coordinates the inputs to the hash functions using the ags of a packet header The reconﬁgurable aspects of FPGAs make reprogramming possible to monitor a variety of network statistics Our case study in Section 4 focuses on open connec tion requests originating from or incoming to hosts by utilizing the SYN and ACK ags Other possible statistics include the number of live connections the ow size of active connections amount of service-related trafﬁc or connection based statistics such the number of connections for speciﬁc services on a host These measures would utilize the PSH push RST reset FIN nish and URG urgent ags For instance a feature sketch monitoring web trafﬁc at a particular host would use the source IP and destination port elds Port 80 is designated as the port for http Other destination ports such as 20 or 21 are designated for FTP trafﬁc and 23 for telnet services However each FS monitors only one network characteristic By using multiple FSs along with the relationships between FSs we can infer additional network behavior information The feature sketch FS is an application of sketches used for data stream modeling It uses a constant amount of memory and has constant per-record update and reconstruction cost Each row in the FS is accessed in parallel with different hash functions This favors FPGAs versus expensive per-ﬂow methods An FS contains H rows each of length K When H¿1 the accuracy of ESTIMATE queries improves Section 5 presents the accuracy results This increased accuracy is achieved by addressing each row in the FS with a different hash function HF This way the distribution of informatio n varies for each row We chose the Jenkins Hash for its speed and provable scatter properties It is implemented in various Linux kernels as a component to the IPtables connection tracking module 11  With an FPGA all hash functions are computed in parallel Also by pipelining the Jenkins Hash FEM can accept a packet on every clock cycle thus increasing throughput Lastly the data aggregate DA component takes H values and estimates the actual value for a query Using statistical estimation techniques we show that ESTIMATE queries to the FS are accurate The heuristic we implement to estimate the value of a query takes the minimum of the H values in the FS The minimum value suffers the least from collisions Other estimation techniques are plausible 9 b ut we found the minimum estimate usually gives the best results and the least hardware complexity Minimum comparisons are performed in parallel such that this module is not on the critical path of FEM 4 CASE STUDY EDGE ROUTER In this section we present an application of FEM at the router level for characterizing network behavior Figure 3 is a simple diagram of network trafﬁc occurring at any two nodes A and B Node A represents outgoing trafﬁc The gure depicts different types of incoming trafﬁc to node B through different ports Port scans and SYN oods access any range of ports   A B Network B  Fig 2  Case Study Example If the FEM is placed at the host level for example at A the architecture is simple Each node is aware of its location when processing network packets so the feature controller FC easily preserves connection ordering However when placing FEM at a router additional logic is needed to preserve connection ordering For example when A and B communicate with each other the source IP/port and destination IP/port elds in a packet are not consistent with the particular node which started the connection This case study illustrates how to apply FEM to monitor network activity usually associated with SYN ood and port scans from a router’s perspective Each FEM consists of a number of FSs For each FS the key is denoted K and the feature value is denoted V The source IP is designated SIP destination IP DIP source port SPORT destination port DPORT and protocol PROTO The ags applicable for this case study are the SYN and ACK ags We want to track the behavior associated with these two attacks First it is known that SYN ood trafﬁc is directed at a DIP DPORT combination Port scans are more exible and use any combination of DIP DPORT With an array of FSs network behavior can be characterized for any given window of packets in a network stream To monitor the behaviors of port scans and SYN oods we propose the setup in Figure 4 Four FSs are accessed and updated in parallel with a stream of packets Each FS monitors a different network 440 


Fig 3  Case Study Example characteristic Our architect ure favors FPGA implementation since the feature controller can be reprogrammed and easily placed back into the network without any modiﬁcation to the core architecture Section 5.2 details the FPGA implementation and performance of a FEM module with one FS Because multiple FSs are accessed in parallel the width of the FEM has a minor impact on performance N is implemented to oversee the amount of trafﬁc between any two hosts For a SIP set and FS3 returns a value greater than a threshold pre-determined by other intrusion detection algorithms we claim x is vertically scanning x  If not x may be horizontally or block scanning on the network Using both N  we are able characterize additional network behavior The main difference between each FS is how the FC coordinates addressing each FS As described the ags SYN and ACK are used to intelligent conﬁgure each FEM Nonetheless our architecture is general enough to measure other network characteristics Using SYN/FIN relationships for opening and closing network connections it is possible keep an FS updated with trafﬁc ow sizes FEM can be employed at both the edge routers or on speciﬁc hosts Our example contains extra logic for router implementation connection ordering Host implementation would actually be simpler because the perspective of network trafﬁc is narrower 5 RESULTS 5.1 Simulations In this section we investigate the accuracy of using feature sketches by testing different FS sizes There are no known benchmarks speciﬁcally compiled for feature extraction so we arbitrarily chose six days of traces from the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation 13 H a l f of the traces contain labeled attacks and the other half do not Nonetheless FS should accurately represent the network environment We simulate a FS K=\(SIP DIP DPORT SPORT K=\(SYNSYN/ACK Our test on the FS is more intensive because more connections are simultaneously tracked By virtue of design FS is constantly updating so we stream in 24 hours of network activity and query the FS afterwards to compare the FS estimate with exact per-ﬂow results   H=1 H=2 H=4 H=8 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 Fig 4  K\(FS row length vs Accuracy Figure 4 presents the accuracy of using a FS H represents the number of rows in the FS and K represents the size of each row The accuracy is measured as the percentage of precisely estimated ows i.e where the estimated value is equal to the actual value out of all ows in the DARPA traces The results of all six days are averaged together For multiple hash function results H  1 we use the Jenkins Hash with different seed values H K Accuracy 1 16384 97.4238 2 8192 97.9699 4 4096 97.6100 8 2048 95.6835 Ta ble 1  Constant Total K  16384 entries When keeping K constant and increasing H the accuracy also improves For example with H=1 K=2048 the accuracy is 84.3 With H=2 K=1024 the accuracy increases to 87.8 The 3.4 difference equates to 5586 more 441 FS FS FS FS FS FS FS FS 002 FSN if there is a DIP 002VSCAN SIP DIP SIP FS FS 1 aids in SYN ood detection by monitoring the number of un-serviced SYN requests for speciﬁc services When a machine services SYN requests it responds with a packet having the SYN and ACK ags set For a SYN packet a count value is incremented For a SYN/ACK response the count is decremented By placing FS1 at an edge router connection ordering relative to the DIP is easily preserved by checking the ags in the packet All connections in FS1 are candidates for SYN oods and we denote this set SYNFLOODset 2 is monitors hosts with a large number of partially completed SYN requests This activity indicates vertical scans or SYN oods Notice 2 is a superset of 1  2 contains all types of trafﬁc at a particular IP By querying both FSs with ESTIMATE we can approximate the percentage of types of trafﬁc at any DIP Removing SYNFLOODset from 2 leaves candidates for vertical scans VSCANset 3 observes the trafﬁc from any SIP that causes incomplete SYN requests This measure includes vertical horizontal and block scans To differentiate this activity 3 and 


precisely estimated ows of the total 164,276 ows However in most cases increasing K boosts accuracy more than increasing H This is attributed to hash function limitations such as poor scattering or lack of variability between different hash functions or unavoidable collisions in small row size K ex H=8 K=1024 Table 1 represents an example of this behavior The accuracy improves when increasing the number of rows until H=8 at which point the small K value limits the accuracy Overall however the FS data structure ably satisﬁes accuracy demands In Section 5.2 we investigate how increasing H changes throughput and FPGA performance   H=1 H=2 H=4 H=8 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 Fig 5  K FS row length vs Average Deviation Figure 5 reports another measure of the effectiveness of feature sketches the average deviation of estimations from exact per-ﬂow results Clearly increasing H improves estimation of in this case SYN-SYN/ACK values This trend persists for other network behavior measures As in Figure 5 the gap between H=1 and H=2 is the largest It shows that our datasets result in mostly 2 collisions This fact favors more balanced FS conﬁgurations versus a one row FS where collisions adversely affect the accuracy 5.2 FPGA Implemenation FEM was implemented on a X ilinx VirtexII xc2v1000 chip This member of the Virtex II family contains 5120 slices and 40 16Kb Block RAM modules We used Synplify Pro 7.2.1 for logic synthesis and the Xilinx ISE 5.2i suite for placement and routing For our hash function the Jenkins Hash was extensively pipelined to operate at 270.6 MHz Table 2 contains the perform ance and area metrics for FEM implemented for edge routers The performance results are similar for host-level implementation since the added logic in the feature controller FC is not on the critical path of the FEM We test conﬁgurations for H=1 2 and 4 Throughput clock frequency and slices are reported for three overall row sizes K=8192 16384 and 32768 The throughput value is calculated from the 5-tuple data source IP destination IP source port destination port protocol and the 6-bit ag eld used to conﬁgure the FC It is clear that for a given total memory size increasing H K slices Freq\(MHz Throughput\(Gbps 1 8192 628 167.5 18.42 2 4096 1263 202.6 22.29 4 2048 2543 216.6 23.82 1 16384 634 169.3 18.62 2 8192 1265 190.1 20.99 4 4096 2543 193.2 21.25 1 32768 643 113.6 12.50 2 16384 1274 135.4 14.89 4 8192 2543 152.3 16.76 Ta ble 2  Feature Sketch Place-and-Route H increases throughput because it reduces the memory size and hence reduces the access times Similarly for a constant H reducing the total memory amount K also increases the throughput Among the simulated conﬁgurations the best throughput of 23.81 Gbps is achieved for H=4 and K=2048 However note that this conﬁguration has a relatively low accuracy of 94.1 Hence when one considers the accuracy  throughput product the best conﬁguration is H=4 and K=4096 which can extract information at 21.25 Gbps Note that the increase in number of slices is mostly a result of using multiple hash functions in parallel Replicating the hash functions allows higher throughput and frequency at the expense of area If there are area constraints however one could use one hash function implementation for multiple FS rows providing the values to each of them at consecutive cycles This would result in decreased throughput but also reduced area requirement Since the Jenkins Hash is pipelined mapping a hash function to multiple rows would not introduce long extra delays In conclusion the simulations show that feature sketches are effective data structures for network behavior characterization The simulation results demonstrate the gains in accuracy and estimation ability of feature sketches FPGAs take advantage of multiple FS ro ws to satisfy Gi gabit throughput demands Consequently feature sketches the main components of FEM are attractive data structures for FPGAs to exploit parallelism 6 RELATED WORK Many networking applications have found their way into hardware implementations 6  W ith lin k s p eed s i n c r easin g and the multitude of network applications future solutions place a premium on both performance and exibility FPGAs qualify for both these requirements Current generation of FPGAs can operate at speeds ranging from 50 MHz to 250 MHz and have capacity on par with large ASIC designs For example FPGAs have been used in developing platforms for experimentation of active networks 14 for s e r vices such as detection of Denial-of-Service DoS attacks 442 


real-time load balancing for e-commerce servers real-time network based speed recognition servers for v-commerce etc Also high speed front-end lters and security management applications for ATM rewalls have found their way onto FPGAs to reduce performance penalties at the IP level 15  As for ow monitors TCP/IP Splitter 5 h a s b een im plemented as part of the FPX Field-Programmable Port Extender project to perform ow classiﬁcation checksums and packet routing However this implementation is limited to 3 Gbps monitoring In our previous work we implemented a ow size monitor similar to FEM 7  Ho wever the design was not updateable when connections were completed This limitation pre vented achieving an accurate representation of the network In this paper we modify the architecture for update information which increases the accuracy by almost an order of magnitude for comparable conﬁgurations Other studies 16 agree t hat p er  o w met hods will not sufﬁce and propose both intelligent algorithms and multistage lters using multistage hash tables to increase accuracy over Cisco’s NetFlow which uses sampling to characterize network trafﬁc Jupiter T-Series routers also implement a propriety ow monitoring mechanism Although the router runs at 10 Gbps link speeds the monitoring is limited to 250K packets per second for each physical interface card It is also limited in the maximum number of ows 400K and ow creation rate 12K new sessions per second Before these dedicated hardware solutions ow monitoring tools had been implemented in software such as HTTPDUMP 7 CONCLUSIONS Real-time feature extraction is a core component for any intrusion detection system that claims to be truly real-time Signature detection can be done live but live anomaly detection requires a comprehensive picture of the network environment Our feature extraction module provides this functionality using feature sketches which map well onto reconﬁgurable hardware We took advantage of pipelining and inherent parallelism in FPGAs to increase throughput Many network behavior parameters can be monitored using our architecture by making small modiﬁcations to the design These characteristics include ow size number of open connections number of un-serviced connection requests etc The novelty of our design lies in modifying a single FS row into multiple FS rows to increase the accuracy up to 97.61 reduce the estimation error to an average of 0.0365 packets and achieve throughputs up to 21.25 Gbps for a 16K entry FEM 8 REFERENCES  J  W  L  S arang D harmapuri k

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
