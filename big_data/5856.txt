I I NTRODUCTION Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs have recently shown their applicability for diverse kinds of applications They consist of many numbers of small battery-powered memoryconstraint devices named 
among a set of monitored objects However preparing the data needed to generate these rules is a costly process In this paper we propose a new energy-ef\036cient data preparation mechanism named Fused-Schedule-Buffer based technique to prepare the data needed for generating TARs Several experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of the new proposed mechanism with the other proposed techniques Results have shown the outperforming of the Fused-Schedule-Buffer technique in terms of energy consumption sensor nodes 
 Each sensor node is capable of local processing communication data acquisition and processing The sensor nodes collaborate among each others to establish a sensing network for collecting critical information from the surrounding environment However the wide use of WSNs is limited by several challenges These challenges stem from the limited resources of the sensor nodes This impedes WSN performance which in turn affects the QoS of the WSN 2 Se v eral solutions such as clustering multi-hop transmission data aggregation and fusion and knowledge discovery techniques have been proposed to cope with these limitations 5 6 7 9 In the context of WSNs the use of Knowledge Discovery KD is relatively new The aim of KD is to provide useful solutions that can be used to cope with some of the 
limitations of WSNs mentioned earlier Knowledge Discovery KD techniques are used to identify patterns describing the inherited relationships among the sensor nodes To generate these patterns KD relies on data gathered from the sensor nodes during their operational time These data are mined to extract what is called behavioral patterns These patterns capture the temporal relationships among the sensor nodes during their detection process Behavioral patterns can provide useful knowledge that could be used in the decision making process to improve the performance and Quality of Service of a WSN 10 11 De\336ning behavioral patterns describing the activities of the sensor nodes is not an easy task First a formal de\336nition of the nature of the pattern should be provided to serve as the base in which the data needed to generate these patterns should 
be collected Second a cleaning process should be applied to 336lter out the data the really describes the behavior the data Finally a mining technique that is able to generate the de\336ned patterns should be de\336ned Most of the proposed behavioral patterns are concerned with capturing relationships among sensor nodes However some applications are interested in extracting relationships among their monitored objects Target Association Rules TARs a recent proposed behavioral patterns  is an e xample of such patterns TARs aims to discover the correlation among a set of targets monitored by a wireless sensor network at a border area The major application of the Target-based Rules is to predict the location target of a missed reported event TARs is extracted from an architecture that consists of a set 
of sensor nodes deployed to monitor a set of targets This architecture is known by Point-of-Coverage-Wireless-SensorNetwork POCWs To extract TARs from POCW data describing the targets\325 behavior should be accumulated Several techniques have been proposed for this purpose however non of these techniques considered the energy consumption In this paper we propose a new data preparation technique named Fused-Schedule-Buffer based mechanism to prepare the data needed for generating TARs The main goal of the proposed technique is to minimize the energy consumption of the sensor nodes as much as possible by using a buffer mechanism within each sensor node to pro\336le the data during the monitoring time Later the node will decide sending its data based on the probability 
that the collected data will participate in formulating the TARs This paper is organized as follow Section II describes the POCWS\325s topology Section III reviews some of the related works Section IV introduces the data preparation mechanism proposed in this paper Section VI presents the the performance analysis of the proposed data preparation mechanism in comparison with other data preparation mancinisms Section VII concludes this paper II POCW\325 S A RCHITECTURE Target Association Rules TARs aims to discover the inherited correlations among a set of targets in an architecture refer to as Point of Coverage Wireless Sensor Network POCW POCWs consist of a set of targets

This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 20\11 proceedings responsible for monitoring a set of targets that are within its sensing range Targets may be gates at border areas TARs de\336nes the time in which correlated targets may be subjected to the same event We refer to the reader to for more details about TARs TARs will have a great impact on enhancing the performance of the network For instance TARs will be able to predict the location of the missed reported event or it may be a based for a prediction model that can predict the location of the next event in the near future III R ELATED W ORK Data Mining techniques as means to generate hidden patterns from a large amount of data have bee recently contributed to the 336eld of wireless sensor networks They aim to de\336ne behavioral patterns that capture the inherited relations among the sensor nodes The generated patterns can be used later to enhance the performance of the the network Several works have been proposed for generating behavioral patterns from wireless sensor networks 22 24 These works have targeted the data values of the sensor nodes in other words the sensors values are the main objects of the rules Loo et studies the problem of mining associations between sensors\325 values in data streams generated from sensor nodes in a particular wireless sensor network Their technique depends on a data model that stores data reported from sensor nodes presenting it in a way that facilitates the adoption of Loosy Counting algorithm  that mak es one pass analysis of the data In this data model sensors are assumed to take values from a 336nite discrete number of values A quantization method is applied for the continuous values The time is divided into equal-sized intervals and snapshots from the sensors\325 readings are taken whenever there is change to these readings These snapshots are stored in a database in the form of contexts In the authors proposed Sensor Association Rules as an attempt to capture the temporal correlations between sensor nodes in a particular WSN The main difference in this approach from others is that the sensors themselves happen to be the main objects in the extracted rules not the sensors\325 readings To prepare the data needed for generating Sensor Association Rules each sensor node should monitor its activity over time and inform the Sink about the time slots in which events were detected It is important to note that data activities The data collected from the network are a meta-data describing the sensors\325 behaviors this differs from data reported by the sensor about the surrounding environment i.e sensors\325 readings Sensor data activities can be collected using existing routing protocols or using one of several data gathering algorithms However none of these algorithms is designed to collect data for mining purposes and they do not consider the redundance that exists between sensors\325 data activity These factors result in the need for special data collecting mechanisms for the purpose of mining Two different mechanisms have been proposed for the preparation of data needed for generating Sensor Association  These mechanisms are as follo ws Direct Reporting in this mechanism sensor behavioral data is transferred to the Sink without any processing by the sensor node Distributed Extraction this mechanism is designed to put more computational load on the sensor nodes by equipping each sensor with additional storage space to store behavioral data for the given historical period In the authors proposed the T ar get Association Rules\(TARs is an attempt to formally de\336ne a new behavioral patterns for a wireless sensor architecture that consists of a set of targets monitored by a pre-deployed sensor nodes Two data perpetration mechanisms were proposed for collecting the data needed to generate the TARs namely the All-Nodes and Schedule-Buffer mechanisms In the All-Nodes mechanism all the sensor nodes are kept in the active mode Once an event is detected by a sensor node it directly reports that event to the Sink The major advantage of the All-Nodes mechanism is the ability to pro\336le the targets\325 activities in all the cases even if the target is not active This data may be used later to capture statistical information about the targets In the Schedule-Buffer mechanism sensor nodes are assumed to be grouped into a set of sponsor sets Each sponsor set contains a set of sensor nodes that cover the whole area under monitoring Employing sponsor sets will eliminate the redundant data resulted from reporting the same event by more one sensor Each sensor node is assumed to have a buffer that contains an entry for each time slot in the given historical period Once an event is detected the buffer entry corresponding to the current time slot is set At the end of the historical period the senor will send its entries to the Sink if it meets the given minimum support otherwise nothing is sent Also a global schedule is de\336ned by the Sink that regulate the operational time of the sensor nodes IV T ARGET B ASED A SSOCIATION R ULES D ATA P REPARATION To generate the Target-based Association Rules the sink maintains a target database that stores the activity sets of each target The data in the target database may be prepared either at the sink level or at the sensor node level If the data is prepared at the sensor node level the last step of data preparation would then involve the actual transmission of the prepared data to the sink where data mining is performed Inclusion of energy conservation in data preparation mechanisms could help extend the network lifetime simply by reducing the energy consumption associated with data preparation Toward this end we propose a new data preparation mechanism for preparing the data needed for mining Target-Based association rules in POCW We refer to this mechanism by Fused-ScheduleBuffer data preparation mechanism Before we start describing the proposed technique we would like to highlight some assumptions We assume that the network has been deployed and that all its elements initialized without a problem and the sink knows how many sensor nodes are working as expected their position and the position of the targets First the sink divides the sensor nodes into several

Further improvement to both Schedule-Buffer and FusedSchedule-Buffer based Data Preparation Mechanisms is possible if the scheduled sensor nodes are allowed to predict whether or not the complete pro\336le will meet the minimum support requirement If the scheduled sensor node predicts that the next-scheduled sensor node will meet the minimum support then it would send its partial pro\336le to the nextscheduled sensor node Otherwise the sensor node will not send the partial pro\336le of the target Instead it will notify the next-scheduled sensor node to either not send its own partial pro\336le or start the partial pro\336ling over with new parameters VI P ERFORMANCE E VA L UAT I O N In this section we present a comparison analysis for the performance of the POCW during the data preparation process using the All-Nodes Schedule-Buffer and Fused-ScheduleBuffer based mechanisms The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the POCW are the number of messages needed to report the activity sets to the Sink and the average energy consumptions per sensor node In the simulation setting we assume that all sensor nodes have the same sensing range is greater or equal to the average distance between any two consecutive targets-to ensure the overlapping among the covered targets Each node uses its full sensing coverage for monitoring targets but its effective sensing range is limited to a fraction of its maximum transmission range For target\325s activity we assume that the target observations would follow a Poisson distribution Ho we v er  it is possible to modify these parameters depending on the applications and sensor speci\336cations respectively Targets are assumed to be located at 336xed points in a square grid of 500  Sponsor sets are disjointed groups of sensor nodes each set can completely and reliably cover all the targets in the network Using scheduled sets to take turns monitoring prolongs the lifetime of the network instead of having all the sensor nodes monitoring the targets at the same time The method used for sensor nodes\325 grouping is the one de\336ned in Second the s ink s chedules these s ponsor sets for target monitoring each sponsor set is scheduled for a speci\336c time in the total historical period V F USED S CHEDULE B UFFER BASED D ATA P REPARATION M ECHANISM The Fused-Schedule-Buffer data preparation mechanism is an improved version of the Schedule-Buffer based mechanism see for more details The impro v ement consists of allo wing the sensor nodes to collaborate with each other during the data preparation process i.e preparing the targets\325 behavioral buffer The collaboration is of a simple form Each sensor node sends the recorded partial target\325s buffers to the one scheduled next and so on until the complete buffer is obtained for a desired period of time Other than the same assumptions used to de\336ne the Schedule-Buffer based mechanism we assume the existence of direct collaboration between the sensor nodes in different sponsor sets This means that not only does each sensor node in a sponsor set knows which targets must be monitored recorded and reported to the sink but also which sensor nodesfrom different sponsor sets-cover the same targets Collaboration ensures that the sensor nodes are provided with more information about the targets during the lifetime of the network for better performance In fact the sensor nodes progressively learn more about the monitored targets The operation mode of the sensor nodes in the Fused-based mechanism is similar to the Schedule-based mechanism The nodes are divided into a set of sponsor sets and each set will monitor for T time Once an event is detected around one of the targets the target\325s buffer entry corresponding to the current time slot is set At the end of the sensor\325s scheduled time T one of the following two cases may occur The 336rst case is when the end of the scheduled time does not correspond to the end of the historical period Here the sensor node sends all its targets\325 partial buffers the set entries including those buffers received from the previous scheduled sponsor sets to the next sensor nodes scheduled to take over the monitoring of the same targets In addition sensor nodes use the same heuristic used in the schedule-buffer mechanism to mak e sure their reporting will be signi\336cant and leading to a behavioral buffer that will meet the minimum support The second case happens if the end of the sensor\325s scheduled time corresponds to the end of the historical period At this stage the target\325s buffers contain the activity sets for the complete historic period i.e the complete behavioral buffers of the targets monitored by the sensor node Therefore scheduled sensor nodes prepare and send the complete behavioral buffer to the sink if it meets the minimum support TABLE I S IMULATION PARAMETERS USED IN PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Historical Period Slot Size Read Write Erase from

16 16 Mx M using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and signi\336cantly less than the number of messages transmitted when using the All-Node mechanism If we compare the performance of the sensor nodes that use the Schedule-Buffer and the FusedSchedule-Buffer mechanisms to the ones using the All-Nodes mechanism we can see that those sensor nodes using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism transmit only 43-47 of the messages transmitted by the All-Nodes mechanism The same node using the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism achieves an even more signi\336cant reduction since it only transmits between 35-45 of the total number of messages transmitted if it were to use the All-Node mechanism This reduction of the number of transmitted messages affects the energy consumption levels directly The energy consumption per node for the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism is less than the average energy consumption using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and signi\336cantly less than the energy used in the AllNode mechanism In the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism each node reporting activities to the Sink requires between 42-50 of the energy exhausted by a sensor node using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and between 30-32 of the energy exhausted by a node in the All-Node mechanism The reduction in the number of messages is explained by using the global schedule and the buffer mechanisms used by Schedule-Buffer scheme The Schedule-Buffer mechanism also outperforms the All-Nodes mechanism in terms of energy consumption reduction achieved during data preparation in this simulation the Schedule-Buffer mechanism uses 70-75 of the energy used by the All-Node mechanism VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a new data preparation mechanism named Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism to prepare the data needed for generating the TARs The proposed mechanism is able to reduce the number of messages that have to be sent to the Sink about the targets\325s activities by eliminating the redundancy resulted from having multi sensor nodes reporting the same event beside the proposed mechanism make sure that a sensor node will not send its data the data collected about the target\325s behavior if the target is not active enough Simulation results have shown that the FusedSchedule-Buffer mechanism outperforms the All-Nodes and Schedule-Buffer mechanism in terms of energy conservation An interesting

The proposed approach focuses on Mining Maximal Frequent Itemset Generation. In this paper, Array based approach and Effective Pruning Mechanism is used for generating Maximal frequent patterns There are two main ingredients to develop an efficient MFI algorithm. The first is the set of techniques used to reduce the size of search space, and the second is the representation used to perform fast frequency computations. This paper describes how proposed algorithm achieves the same  In general the structure of the transactional database may be in two different ways -Horizontal data format and Vertical data format. Here, we are using vertical data format for storing the transactions in the database. In vertical data format, the data is represented as item-tidset format, where item is the name of the item and tidset is the set of transaction identifiers containing the item Consider our example database which includes six different items, I = {A, B, C, D, E, F} and six transactions T= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The vertical data format of the database DB is given below Table 1 : Vertical Data format of the transactional database DB All Frequent items are extracted first. The support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidset of each item. Let us consider the minimum support to be 3 From the above structure, all items except F are frequent The items A, B, C, D and E are frequent items and will be considered to next level In the next level a dynamic array \(N intersecting the tidsets of every two frequent items. The constructed array \(N two frequent items. The size of the array will be n\(n+1 where n is the number of frequent items. Value of each and every cell in the array is initialized to zero. The value of cell N[i,j] is 1 if number of transaction occurred in the intersection of tidset of frequent item i and j satisfies the user specified minimum support. Otherwise the cell value is zero. Once the array is constructed successfully, all possible Maximal frequent itemsets\(PMFI from the array. The constructed array is given below N ABCD 


E D C B  Table 2: Dynamic array \(N frequent items The possible maximal frequent itemsets \(PMFI obtained from this array are considered to the next level All the other itemsets are pruned. The number of possible large itemsets is less than or equal to number of frequent itemsets. From this array, PMFIs are obtained in two ways. We can take all columns and first row. \(Columns A B, C, D and row E Rows E D, C, B and Column A One column entry or one row entry is a single PMFI. For example the itemset \(x,y,z itemset if and only if there is an entry 1 in both cells N[x,y] and N[x,z]. For example ADC is a PMFI because of the values of both cells N [A, D] and N [A, C] is 1 Once all PMFIs are retrieved from the array, they are arranged in descending order with respect to their size First column entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item A \(ADC the PMFI includes the frequent item B \(B entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item C CDE the frequent item D \(D PMFI that includes the frequent item E \(EC are arranged in descending order with respect to their size So the Itemsets in PMFI are ADC, CDE, EC, B, D The First itemset ADC has no superset in MFI and it is frequent. So ADC is a MFI\(with support count 3 added to MFI The Second itemset CDE has no superset in MFI and it is a infrequent item set. so all \(n-1 includes C CDE are generated. 2-itemsets of CDE are CD and CE.\(DE is not taken for test. It does not include the item C ignored. CE is frequent and it has no supersets in MFI. So it is added to MFI. CE is a MFI\(with support count 3 obtained from CDE 


The Third itemset EC is already included in MFI and it is ignored The Forth item B has no superset in MFI and it is a frequent item and it is added to MFI The Fifth item D has a superset in MFI and it is ignored From above example, MFIs with support count 3 are ADC, CE, B The process will be continued till testing all possible maximal frequent itemsets. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely The pseudo code for proposed algorithm is given below in figure 1  Item  Tidset A  T1, T2, T3, T4 B  T1, T4, T5 C  T1, T2, T3, T5, T6 D  T1, T2, T3 E  T2, T4, T5, T6 F  T6, T5    Pseudo code Find All MFI\(PMFIs,min_sup all Maximal Frequent Itemsets Inputs i Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets ii for mining process Interfacing Functions Output i Find All MFI\(PMFIs, min_sup For each x  PMFIs if x has a superset in MFI continue else if x is frequent MFI=MFI U x else Find MFI by obtaining Permutations\(x,min_sup For End return MFI

So, the time taken to compute MFI is negligible. As we are following vertical data format, support also need not be calculated separately In this case, support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidlist of each FI. The vertical representation has the following major advantages over the horizontal layout: Firstly, computing the support of itemsets is simpler and faster with the vertical layout since it involves only the intersections of tidsets. Secondly, with the vertical layout, there is an automatic reduction of the database before each scan in that only those itemsets that are relevant to the following scan of the mining process are accessed from disk Pruning The Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets\(Maximal 


Candidate Itemsets array. All Maximal frequent itemsets are obtained from only these PMFIs. Other itemsets are pruned automatically. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely. The proposed approach applies superset checking to eliminate the non maximal frequent itemsets. Once all PMFIs are generated, each PMFI is checked whether it is a subset of any maximal pattern. If so the itemset is eliminated entirely. Counting is not performed for this itemset and next PMFI is taken for test IV. RESULTS The testing of the proposed algorithm has been carried out on the real dataset \(containing long itemsets the number of candidate itemsets taken by the proposed algorithm to find MFIs and it is compared to Genmax algorithm for various values of minimum support. The support is varied from 75 to 95. The proposed algorithm had been compared with GenMax algorithm and results show the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets to find all MFIs Figure 2 illustrates that, the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets and produces all MFIs very quickly than GenMax algorithm. Support is taken as x axis and the number of candidate itemsets taken to find all MFI is taken as y axis For Mushroom, the improvement is best explained by how the MFI is computed at each level and found directly without waiting for FI completely. This leads to a much greater reduction in the overall search space, since the reductions is so great at highest levels  Figure 2. Number of Candidate itemsets taken by ABMFI and GenMax Algorithm from Mushroom dataset This approach will be working very efficiently for any sparse and dense dataset, when the size of maximal frequent itemsets is close to the number of frequent itemsets V. CONCLUSION In this paper we have investigated an array based approach and algorithm \(ABMFI itemsets. The algorithm is straight forward  basic steps are finding frequent items from the database, Dynamic 


array construction and Pruning infrequent itemset obtaining Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets from array and finding MFIs from PMFIs. Our algorithm had been compared with GenMax algorithm and obtained that the proposed algorithm generates less number of candidate itemsets to find all MFIs. The vertical data format representation of the database, Dynamic array construction and directly computing MFIs from PMFIs are the added advantages of this algorithm REFERENCES 1]. Agrawal, R., T.

experts can start their ore deposits estimations with much clearer data which is easier to deal with XII. CONCLUSION We have presented how data mining can be applied to the borehole data coming from active mine area. We are certain that data mining has a huge potential for other types of borehole data. One of the important steps in data mining is the preparation of data into useful form for various algorithms. Together with domain experts we have identified a way for transforming data to a form acceptable to k-NN classification and association rules mining algorithms Although we have shown how the k-NN classification and association rules mining techniques can be applied here this framework will open new possibilities to perform other data mining tasks to this type of data. Our experimental results are very promising in this regard as they show that we are not only able to match the accuracy of the results with IDW method used in the mining industry, but also exceed it \(93.1% accuracy was obtained by 3-NN method while IDW gave 88.5% accuracy rules as a separate analysis tool can improve not only k-NN classification results but also IDW interpolation results. This is particularly important for convincing mining companies 119 of the benefits of data mining, as with a little effort they can improve the method they are already using As we have shown in this paper, not only choosing right classification techniques can help us to improve interpolation, but more general analysis on data like association rules can contribute a lot. Thus, the more knowledge we have on the hidden relationships and patterns the more accurately you can construct an interpolation. Moreover, discovering hidden correlations not only important for this task, but also can contribute to understanding about complex geological processes that this specific area undergone. Therefore data mining, which can discover useful knowledge purely from data is of great importance and will be area of research for next generation of exploration and mining specialists Finally, we have proposed to use mathematical morphology for filtering the results of rock type interpolation. In the example given here, we have seen that it performed well in removing relatively small objects and filtering out large 


areas of interest from rock types XIII. FUTURE WORK This paper provides a framework for using data mining techniques on the borehole data. Using this framework we would like to investigate possibilities of using other classification techniques on this type of data. We mentioned that borehole data can contain more information about the area besides spatial coordinates, rock types and metal grades so classification that utilizes this extra information will be on our immediate research agenda Application of mathematical morphology provides possibilities for further research on domaining \(filtering out large areas of interest be given also to this ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I want to thank the Director of the WH Bryan Mining and Geology Research Centre, at the University of Queensland Professor Alan Bye and his PhD student Mr Younes Fadakar Alghalandis for contributing their expertise to this research This work is supported by the AuScope National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy by the Australian Commonwealth, the Queensland State Government and The University of Queensland REFERENCES 1] A.
