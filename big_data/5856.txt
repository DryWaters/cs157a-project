Abstract 
The domain of radio astronomy is currently facing signiìcant computational challenges foremost amongst which are those posed by the development of the worldês largest radio telescope the Square Kilometre Array SKA Preliminary speciìcations for this instrument suggest that the nal design will 
incorporate between 2000 and 3000 individual 15 metre receiving dishes which together can be expected to produce a data rate of many TB/s Given such a high data rate it becomes crucial to consider how this information will be processed and stored to maximise its scientiìc utility In this paper we consider one possible data processing scenario for the SKA for the purposes of an all-sky pulsar survey In particular we treat the selection of promising signals from the SKA processing pipeline as a data stream classiìcation problem We consider the feasibility of classifying signals that arrive via an unlabelled and heavily class imbalanced data stream using currently available algorithms and 
frameworks Our results indicate that existing stream learners exhibit unacceptably low recall on real astronomical data when used in standard conìguration however good false positive performance and comparable accuracy to static learners suggests they have deìnite potential as an on-line solution to this particular big data challenge

infeasible to store in their entirety data streams pose a signiìcant challenge to those seeking to unlock the knowledge they contain In recent years considerable research effort has been expended towards identifying and solving these problems leading to the development of many effective data stream learners However the main focus of this work has been upon learning from streams that possess a reasonably balanced class distribution and completely labelled or in some cases partially labelled data In situations where the class balance is heavily skewed or where it is unrealistic to expect more than a small fraction of the stream to be labelled we face a new set of challenges that undermine the effectiveness of 
existing approaches In this paper the results of an empirical investigation are presented which demonstrate how the performance of Hoeffding bound based data stream classiìers can degrade when faced with an increasingly imbalanced data stream Motivated by a real world problem faced by the radio astronomy community this paper seeks to add to data stream research efforts by drawing increased attention to a learning scenario that is likely to become commonplace as data streams appear in ever more diverse domains II M OTIVATION Radio Pulsars are extremely dense rapidly rotating stellar remnants formed during the collapse of massive stars They 
are a somewhat rare phenomena which happen to provide a unique environment in which to perform numerous astrophysical experiments These scientiìc opportunities ha v e motivated the search for pulsars using large radio telescopes In order to nd pulsars the signals arriving at the receiver of a radio telescope must be fed into a computational pipeline designed to search for periodic broadband radio emission Those periodic signals possessing a signal-to-noise ratio above a predeìned threshold value based on domain knowledge are considered to be pulsar candidates worthy of further investigation The search pipeline itself is made up of many processing components Broadly speaking these can be separated into 
those that act as data processors which clean and correct the data e.g excision of radio frequency interference and search routines tasked with isolating signals of interest Crucially the volume of data moving through such search pipelines has been increasing steadily for some time Indeed as observed in pulsar surv e y data capture rates ha v e e xhibited a le v el of growth closely describable by Mooreês Law This growth reîects advances in technology that have enabled various improvements in survey speciìcations from increased survey sampling rates to ner frequency resolution However there is an inverse relationship between the sampling rate of a pulsar 
survey and the data capture rate As the sampling period decreases thereby increasing sensitivity to shorter period emissions the data capture rate increases When coupled with ner frequency resolution and wider observational bandwidths this relationship creates successive data storage and processing challenges Similarly an inverse relation exists between the sampling rate of a survey and the number of signals meeting the candidate selection criteria As the majority of signals captured at the receiver of a telescope are attributable to noise

or interference nearly the entire set of selected candidates are of no scientiìc value Separating those candidates which are likely to lead to discovery from those which are spurious is therefore becoming increasingly difìcult to do The next generation of radio telescope the Square Kilometre Array SKA is currently under de v elopment by an international consortium Due to begin science operations in the next decade the SKA will produce data at an unprecedented rate rmly ushering in the era of exascale computing For pulsar survey operations alone the data rate is predicted to be between TB/s This is man y orders of magnitude greater than previous surveys Using existing technology it is practically impossible to acquire the hardware and supporting infrastructure required for storing all this data permanently due to nancial restrictions Hence future SKA surveys must either a utilise technological advances that make it feasible to store such large quantities of data at low cost or b process the data in real-time storing only a fraction of the data for off-line analysis Although one cannot say with certainty it appears that real-time analysis is the only tractable and cost effective long term solution to this problem If this is indeed the case then in the future candidate selection will have to be performed on-line and in real-time In the absence of an existing real-time selection system or the means to deal with the impending increase in candidates the possibility exists that important discoveries could be delayed or possibly missed due to inadequate supporting computational infrastructure Given that present day searches for radio transients 1 are already being conducted in real time it seems lik ely that the real-time scenario will win out III P ROBLEM D EFINITION We consider the selection of candidate pulsars as a two-class data stream classiìcation problem We deìne the completely unlabelled input stream  as the stream of candidates emerging from a pulsar search pipeline under a discrete time model Each candidate in the stream is deìned as  where each for is a summary statistic or measure that describes the candidate  We specify binary candidate labels  where is an individual label such that i.e uninteresting  0 interesting  1 Our goal is to learn a function which maps each candidate to its correct label producing the set of labelled candidates  From the set of positively labelled candidates those instances with  can be obtained which should be recommended for inspection As the stream is completely unlabelled only those candidates selected are ever likely to receive their correct labels with the remainder necessarily discarded Even then only a fraction of these may receive labels given the candidate volume and certainly only after a substantial delay Thus this scenario 1 Typically transients are short non-repeating bursts of high energy radio emission can be thought of in terms of two distinct streams The rst from the telescope the second a biased feedback stream containing data labelled by experts Crucially the primary stream emerging from the telescope will be heavily imbalanced in favour of the negative class The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey PMPS for example has so far yielded 742 pulsar discoveries from million candidates gi ving rise to a class balance of roughly 1  11,000 If we make the conservative assumption that the class balance of the PMPS is maintained by the SKA then we can expect to collect some 200,000,000 negative candidates given that current estimates suggest the SKA will detect approximately 20,000 new pulsars in total  A h ypothetical classiìer with perfect recall 1 and an accuracy 2 of 99 applied to these SKA candidates would still select 2 million for further analysis Recall  the ratio of positive to negative instances will be greatly imbalanced 2  Although the negative class is comprised primarily of noise various types of interference will be subject to gradual changes over long time scales and abrupt changes over short ones 3  the data in the stream is completely unlabelled Drift detection must be performed on unlabelled data without the prospect of obtaining correct labels within a reasonable time 4  The SKA will produce a high throughput data stream It is unrealistic for much more than a small sample of this data to be stored hence processing must likely be done in real-time IV R ELATED W ORK Candidate selection has typically involved the expert selection of candidate signals via some form of summary user interface During the Swinburne Intermediate Latitude Pulsar Survey and PMPS 9 graphical tools were de v eloped which allowed large numbers of candidates to be ltered A later reprocessing of the PMPS spawned the more sophisticated REAPER tool which enabled candidates to be viewed via a customizable graphical plot ultimately leading to the

 5 Although not intended to operate on unlabelled data we begin looking at ways to solve the candidate selection problem by testing the effectiveness of existing algorithms such as the VFDT Using the MOA stream mining framework we test an implementation of the VFDT called the 
discovery of 128 pulsars A new version of this tool called JREAPER was then developed and led to the discovery of 28 pulsars More recently machine learning techniques ha v e been used to lter candidates In a multi-layered perceptron MLP was used to perform an automated re-analysis of a data sample taken from the PMPS The implementation was capable of recalling up to 93 of the pulsars present in PMPS test samples Other methods utilised include Gaussian Mixture models as applied in to rank pulsar candidates from the Fermi 2FGL catalogue The problem of class imbalance is usually tackled by either assigning different costs to training examples thereby reweighting the balance or by resampling the original dataset to achieve a desired balance Resampling can be done in many ways either by over-sampling the minority class or under-sampling the majority class The SMO TE algorithm de v eloped by Chawla et al mix es both of these approaches Empirical results suggest that SMOTE can successfully improve the accuracy of classiìers such as C4.5 and Na  ve Bayes on the minority class In Chen et al de v elop their recursi v e weighted ensemble approach REA for classifying nonstationary imbalanced data streams REA adaptively pushes minority class examples into the current data chunk to balance the class distribution An in-depth discussion of the problems associated with learning from imbalanced data can be found in In terms of unlabelled streams the Semi-supervised learning paradigm has typically been applied when lar ge data sets are continually produced or when the labelling of the data is prohibitively costly Some representati v e w orks in this area include the decision tree based algorithm for classifying concept drifting and unlabelled data streams called SUN developed in 19 the relational K-means based transfer semi-supervised SVM RK-T VM developed for classifying unlabelled drifting data streams and the CSLStream algorithm Concurrent Learning of Data Streams that clusters and classiìes data at the same time V E XPERIMENTS Amongst the most successful of the single model data stream classiìers has been the very fast decision tree VFDT  VFDT is an incremental an y time decision tree learner that uses constant memory and permits model updates in time proportional to the tree depth and data dimensionality VFDTs low runtime and space complexity therefore make it ideal for use on data streams particularly as VFDTês can be dynamically pruned if required to operate under strict memory constraints The output of a VFDT is also guaranteed to be asymptotically similar to a conventional learning algorithm VFDT achieves this by using the Hoeffding bound 5 to choose with a high probability those split attributes that would have been selected given access to all the data as in the nonstreamed scenario By calculating the observed mean of an attribute the bound is able to determine with conìdence is user supplied that the true mean of an attribute is at least where  on imbalanced and unlabelled streams We compare the performance of the to three static classiìers including a standard decision tree a SVM and Na  ve Bayes Our tests were designed to reveal how well the performs if i made to learn from only the examples in the stream and ii pre-trained before being taken on-line Tests of other VFDT tree based algorithms including the   and  both using the have also been completed   In each case the parameters used for these algorithms were set to the defaults provided by MOA In order to test the various data stream classiìers four datasets were utilised see Table I The rst and largest dataset consisted of pulsar candidates obtained during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey HTRU 3  Candidates are represented by 22 continuous numerical attributes each of which is a summary statistic that describes it in some way The data set contains only 1,611 positive and 2,593 negative examples correctly labelled by human annotators The remainder of the dataset is na  vely assumed to be negative However we can constrain the number of actual positives incorrectly labelled in this dataset based on Monte Carlo simulations undertaken by Keith and later by Le vin 27 to some small fraction of approximately 879-916 instances Also of the known 1,108 pulsars in the survey region 725 have been re-detected in this data Thus together the number of re-detections and expected discoveries falls within the range of the 1,611 certain positive examples already labelled The remaining datasets used included the Skin Segmentation MiniBoone and the Magic Gamma Telescope datasets These are obtainable from the UCI machine learning repository Three distinct types of test were undertaken for this work The rst established a baseline level of performance on our 2 This is a

on pulsar data In this case recall rates are zero when no labels are available and slowly increase as more labelled data appears in the stream Static classiìers trained on only a small sample of data 200 positive and 1000 negative instances achieved higher recall rates when treating the complete pulsar data stream as a static data set Recall rates were for C4.5 and for the SVM respectively Though both of these static classiìers return far too many false positives C4.5 returned on average and the SVM  Fig 2 Recall rates of the non pre-trained has a very low false positive return rate when the stream is completely labelled The previously described preference for applying negative classiìcations when the stream is imbalanced means that few positive predictions are ever made Thus false positives become extremely rare For the most imbalanced streams only instances became a false positive As the proportion of labelled items in the stream is reduced the false positive rate increases slightly for the non pre-trained classiìers but greatly for those pre-trained This can be seen in Table IV which shows the false positive rates obtained on unlabelled streams In row one a false positive return rate of 02 equates to false positives much worse than the static classiìers It appears that without labels to learn from the maintains an imprecise model similar to the static classiìers as both are trained on the same sample of data classiìer deteriorate when faced heavily class imbalanced data streams The imbalance appears to skew the class predictions of the Na  ve Bayes classiìers at the leaves of the tree toward the majority class This has the effect of improving classiìer accuracy whilst also degrading recall We have found that pre-training a classiìer before taking it on-line does initially improve the recall rate however the class imbalance makes this effect inherently short term Although these result suggests that VFDT based classiìers such as the are unsuitable for solving the candidate selection problem their capacity to maintain low false positive return rates makes them appealing particularly as we explore ways in which the VFDT approach could be modiìed to accommodate imbalanced streams and thereby increase the recall rate Future work will expand on the results of this investigation and test other data stream classiìers not exclusively based on the Hoeffding bound We also intend to

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
