Audience Behavior Mining Integrating TV Ratings with Multimedia Content Ryota Hinami University of Tokyo Shin’ichi Satoh National Institute of Informatics A general framework for audience behavior mining integrates the analysis of TV ratings and multimedia content Focusing on change points in TV ratings data the authors propose applications for interactive mining of audience behavior and for detecting popular news topics 1070-986X/17/$33.00  
c 2017 IEEE Published by the IEEE Computer Society Multimedia Capturing Mining and Streaming T V ratings have been investigated for many years but most work 1,2 has focused on forecasting the ratings of particular TV programs The motivation was to estimate the cost of TV advertising because advertising rates are directly linked to TV ratings Few works have targeted the mining of ratings data even though such data contains valuable information Moreover researchers have not investigated how to inte 
grate TV ratings with multimedia content such as with video data from TV programs Integrating TV ratings with multimedia content could help identify relationships between audience behaviors and TV program content Consider for example Figure 1 which shows the ratings data for two TV stations covering the ooding of the Kinugawa River on 10 September 2015 along with thumbnail images from the two broadcasts Both stations were broadcasting live up until the time indicated by the red dotted line At that point as the thumb 
nails show one station represented by the green line showed advertisements—that is commercial lms CFs This led to a big transition in viewers from the green station to the blue station Similar behavior from the blue station to the green station also occurs at the gray dotted line where again the thumbnails show a change in live coverage This indicates that viewers were greatly interested in this event and switched between stations as needed for continued event coverage This example 
captures audience behavior for just one event but analysis of larger amounts of such data could enable the automatic extraction of audience behavior patterns Furthermore integrating such data with multimedia content could reveal hidden behaviors Understanding audience behavior is useful for several reasons First it indicates what is of interest to people which is important for creating TV programs that attract viewers It’s also important in terms of advertising because iden 
tifying patterns that lead to higher ratings can help broadcasters obtain more sponsors Finally it helps with risk management by revealing how people get information following a disaster which could help determine how best to convey important information to people in an emergency For more information see the TV Audience Ratings sidebar Here we focus on discovering knowledge in TV ratings data by combining such data with multimedia content videos and transcripts Our goal is to establish a generic framework for 
mining TV audience behavior from TV ratings Although user behavior is being explored by many works 3,4 most of this recent work focuses on social networks little work has addressed the behavior of TV audiences To discover relationships between TV ratings and multimedia content we focus on the change points—that is the points in time when people rst tune in to a particular TV program Because these points reect the active intention of TV viewers they contain valuable informa 
tion about viewers interests We describe these points using visual features extracted from video and using keywords extracted from transcripts Because the number of such points is huge we apply various lters Here in this extended version of our earlier work 5 we propose two applications using our framework 44 


demonstrating how the framework can extract valuable knowledge from TV ratings data TV Ratings in Japan In our work we use TV ratings provided by Video Research which started audience measurement in Japan in 1962 It has been the only major rm providing audience measurements since the Nielsen Corporation left Japan in 2000 Their ratings are calculated from sampled households randomly selected from certain areas The ratings are surveyed for each of the 27 broadcast areas According to Video Research’s Rating Guide Book 6 there are 600 households in each of the three main areas of Japan Kanto Kansai and Nagoya and 200 in each of the other 24 areas for a total of 6,600 households Systematic random sampling is used to select households rst a random starting point is selected and then every n th household is picked up from the list of all households in a certain area The interval n is the total number of households divided by the number of households to be sampled For the work presented here we used the TV ratings for the Kanto area the greater Tokyo area which has a population of approximately 40.6 million constituting 18.2 million households with a TV The ratings in Kanto are calculated on the basis of data collected from 600 sampled households 6 The rating for a particular TV program is dened as the percentage of households that watched the program which is recorded minute by minute Typical Audience Behavior Our focus here is on the mining of audience behaviors Before explaining the details of our proposed method we discuss audience behaviors—that is how people typically watch TV and switch channels Figure 2 shows examples of audience behaviors Audiences seemingly select channels according to their interests However audiences do not always watch the programs that best match their interests because they only have information about the channel they’re watching the highlighted regions in Figure 2 they don’t have information about the channels they’re not watching the shaded regions In TV Audience Ratings TV audience ratings TV ratings are a key indicator in the field of TV broadcasting they’re used to assess the popularity of TV programs A program’s TV rating indicates the percentage of all TV households tuned in to that program TV ratings are a standard measure used to determine the impact of advertising—that is how many targeted people are watching the advertisement Broadcasters focus on increasing the ratings of their programs to acquire more sponsors TV ratings can also be used as sensor to gauge the interests of people Programs that capture people’s interests get high ratings Conversely if people are not interested in a program’s content they switch to another channel and the ratings decrease TV ratings can thus act as social sensors that indicate popular topics and social trends such as what types of news are of interest and which performers are currently popular Discovering such knowledge from TV ratings data can help broadcasters create TV programs that attract more people TV ratings also include important information for risk management In an emergency such as a natural disaster the government must deliver correct information to people in a timely manner TV is a key medium for conveying information to many people in real time By analyzing TV ratings to determine how people get information from TV we can judge whether critical information has been correctly delivered and can take measures to improve the dissemination of such information 17.5 15 12.5 Rating 10 7.5 5 15:15 15:30 15:45 16:00 16:15 16:30 Time Figure 1 Audience behaviors observed in TV ratings data for the flooding of the Kinugawa River The blue and green lines represent two stations covering the flood The red line indicates when the green station showed an advertisement and lost viewers to the blue station The gray line indicates the reverse situation April–June 2017 45 


Figure 2a for example and audience member looks at all four channels before selecting channel 2 However in Figure 2b the audience member starts with channel 2 without checking the other channels and continues watching that channel even after the targeted drama has ended Such passive watching behavior does not reect the audience’s intention The only cases when we can directly observe the intentions of audiences is when they change channels after zapping also known as channel surng In the examples in Figure 2 channel switching when the topic changes or when a CF starts corresponds to such cases Audiences change channels and start zapping when uninteresting content such as a CF starts Moreover because audiences get the information of all channels by zapping they can select the channel of most interest In other words such cases show the active intentions of audiences Our framework extracts such activeaudience intentions by focusing on the change points in TV ratings which facilitate the discovery of audience interests A Framework for Mining Audience Behavior To automatically nd particular patterns or events indicating the interests of people we focus on the change points in ratings data In particular we focus on the micro-level change points where the per-minute ratings change signicantly in a minute Because the number of viewers increases or decreases suddenly at such points we assume that these points provide more valuable information than other points so we detect and analyze them in combination with video content and other metadata such as captions We can better understand the interests of viewers by analyzing the content corresponding to these change points The meaningful patterns in TV ratings data can be discovered by mining a large number of change points The pipeline of the proposed framework shown in Figure 3 has three steps 1 Detect change points  Detect as many micro-level change points as possible from ratings data 2 Describe change points  Extract information for each change point from multimedia data extract visual features from video data for example 3 Filter and aggregate  Filter points to reject noise or extract the target and aggregate filtered points to extract knowledge Our main focus is on steps 2 and 3—that is describing ltering and aggregating the change points using multimedia content Various features are extracted from oneminute data for each point to attach rich descriptions that characterize the points These characterizations are used to lter and aggregate the points and the ltered points are then Audience behaviors Turn on TV and zap to nd target news 15:10 Turn on TV to watch drama 20:00 Drama starts 20:00, ch2 Drama ends 21:00, ch2 CF starts 21:45, ch2 Watch drama 20:00Ð21:00 Keep watching after the end of drama 21:00Ð45 Zapping when CF starts 21:45Ð47 Switch to the channel of most interests 21:47 Switch channel because CF starts, topic changes 15:32, 15:55 t t ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4 ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4 Events on TV CF starts 15:32, ch2 Topic is changed 15:55, ch4 a b Figure 2 Example behaviors of two TV audiences one audience member a searches for information on specific news topics and another b turns on TV to watch a specific drama The channels that the audience member watches are highlighted and other channels are shaded The audience member only has information on the highlighted channels CF commercial film                 Ratings data Change-point detection Change-point description Filtering aggregation Visualization Interactive feedback Video Captions EPG Figure 3 The flow of the proposed framework detect describe and filter and aggregate change points IEEE MultiMedia 46 


visualized Visualizing the statistics of change points helps us better understand patterns in ratings increases We can interactively add or change lters to visualize more detailed cases and nd meaningful patterns We use the following multimedia data to describe the change points  video—that is broadcast videos corresponding to the TV ratings  captions—that is text transcripts of TV programs and  electric program guide EPG information—that is information on TV programs including title category and description We can describe the content at each change point with rich information using this data Filtering and aggregating described points enables a precise analysis of the relationship between the ratings and the multimedia content Functions Here we review the functions of the proposed framework Detecting Change Points We adopt a simple approach to detect change points—we identify the points where the ratings increase or decrease above a predetermined threshold in a minute The rate of increase or decrease for each minute is calculated as the difference between the previous and current per-minute ratings A certain number of households start watching a particular TV program at change points either by turning on the TV or switching from other programs For example given that the Kanto area has 18.2 million households with a TV a rating increase of 1 percent means that over 182,000 households tuned into the program Describing Change Points We use several features to describe change points Visual features We use several visual features to characterize images summarized in Table 1 7 We use color and texture as low-level visual features and we use object and emotion features as mid-level features The details of each feature are described elsewhere 5 Object features We generate two object category features based on the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition competition ILSVRC classication score 8 First we use the scores for the nine top-level categories of ImageNet calculated by aggregating the classication scores for 1,000 object categories Second we dene new object categories suitable for TV content by clustering the features of Convolutional Neural Networks On the basis of these categories binary feature are obtained for each frame where each dimension indicates whether the frame belongs to each cluster Each generated cluster represents certain objects or scenes that frequently appear in TV content Figure 4 shows three examples of created clusters representing Table 1 Visual features for each frame Feature No of dimensions Short description Hue-saturation value HSV 7 3 Mean hue saturation and brightness HSV affective 7 3 Pleasure arousal and dominance computed from brightness and saturation Color clusters 7 11 Ratio of pixels covered by each color cluster black blue brown gray green orange pink purple red white and yellow Texture 7 5 Texture based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix GLCM entropy dissimilarity energy homogeneity and contrast Object top-level 9 ImageNet classification scores for top-level categories plant geological natural sport artifact fungus and person Object re-generated 100 Binary feature indicating whether a frame belongs to each of 100 object clusters regenerated for TV content Emotion 8 Scores for amusement anger awe contentment disgust excitement fear and sadness computed using a method described elsewhere 7 April–June 2017 47 


sumo wrestling other sports and weather reports Keywords Keywords are extracted from the transcripts at each change point The words that characterize the TV content are selected as keywords We rst extract nouns from caption and then remove words that are not important to characterize the content The details of keyword extraction are described elsewhere 5 Other information We obtain basic information such as the broadcast time and category of TV programming from the EPG Filtering Techniques Here we describe the ltering techniques we use TV program boundaries Because many people switch the channel when a new TV program starts TV ratings change greatly at the boundary of a TV program The change points at the boundary of a TV program reect the audience’s interest in the TV program itself—not their interest in the content being shown at the time of change This means that the points at boundaries are sometimes noise obscuring making it difcult to analyze the relationship between the content and TV rating We therefore implement lters to exclude points at the boundaries—that is the points within ve minutes of a TV program beginning Commercial films Many change points occur around CFs because a certain number of people change the channel when a CF starts We detect CFs from all broadcast data beforehand because we sometimes want to deal with TV content separate from the CFs—for example to exclude transitions made during a CF We detected CFs using a method based on frequent sequence mining 9 We used two lters to reject change points The rst lter rejects change points that occur during a CF and within two minutes after the CF This helps remove changes motivated by a CF instead of by user interests The second lter extracts change points corresponding to the transition from a channel showing a CF to another channel which is used to focus on people’s interest in the program content At such points—that is those corresponding to when a TV station starts a CF—some viewers start zapping and select a TV program of most interest Visual features and their thresholds As noted earlier visual features are used to lter out change points The type of visual feature see Table 1 and the threshold of its value determine the lter For example we can extract the points that have more than 50 percent black pixels or we can lter out the points that have a score for animal of more than 0.5 or do both Other filters In addition to the lters just introduced we use four additional lters time period such as 19:00–23:00 term such as Sep.–Nov TV program category such as news and keyword such as Kinugawa River Experiments Our data includes the audience ratings for seven TV stations in the Kanto area in 2015 We also use video data transcripts and EPG data from the NII-TVRECS Video Archive System 10 User Behavior Mining System Based on our framework we developed an interactive system for discovering user behavior The system detects change points using an a b c Figure 4 Examples of clusters created for TV content the clusters represent a sumo wrestling b other sports and c weather reports IEEE MultiMedia 48 


increase threshold of 0.7 percent and a decrease threshold of 0.9 percent 67,728 and 41,367 points were detected respectively We computed all of the visual features listed in Table 1 for the detected points using the features to lter and aggregate points We then rejected the change points based on user-specied lters and visualized the aggregated result Analyzing the increase and decrease points revealed valuable knowledge such as which types of programs were of interest to people which program features resulted in high TV ratings and how people behaved following a certain type of event Figure 5 shows the system interface and ow In the following we exemplify system usage by analyzing what type of news captured users interests Filtering The user rst species the lters in accordance with the analysis target Table 2 summarizes the lters that can be used Here because we want to analyze the news we select the news category lter see the top left corner of Figure 5 Statistical analysis The points after ltering are aggregated and visualized which provides a clue to nd the meaningful pattern of TV rating increases/decreases That is the visualized results display information that should help identify which feature is related to the TV ratings For each visual feature the differences in the means of the feature values over the increased/decreased change points is shown in Figure 5 see the feature statistics This information indicates which features are correlated with TV ratings Features with a large difference seem to contribute to an increase in the TV rating and vice versa A breakdown in the form of pie charts of the change points by dominant color and emotion  Filters Add/change lters Apply Þlters Feature statistics of Þltered points Feature distribution Breakdown by object See details of selected feature Breakdown by dominant color and em otion Ratings graph List of change points Figure 5 The interface for the user behavior mining tools It shows how to use the tools and what each function indicates Table 2 Filters used in our framework Filter Argument input Exclude program boundary On or off Exclude CF On or off Limit to transition at time of CF On or off enabled or disabled Visual feature Category of feature threshold such as entropy—more than 0.5 Time period Start time end time such as 19:00–23:00 Term List of months such as Sept Oct Nov Category Category of TV program such as news Keywords List of keywords such as Kinugawa River April–June 2017 49 


is also displayed in Figure 5 Dominant color means the color with the highest value of the 11 basic colors The same is true of dominant emotion The user selects the feature that seems to be important from these charts in order to analyze it in detail In this example the user selects the feature blue Feature details The system then shows in the form of a graph details for the features selected by the user The graph shows the distribution of the selected features in terms of increase and decrease points It also shows a breakdown by dominant regenerated objects for the change points with the 200 highest values the bluest objects in this example Thumbnails of the points corresponding to each object are also shown These charts reveal that blue is the most signicant color because of the weather reports indicating that the viewers were highly interested in such reports In addition to these charts the system shows lists of points with thumbnails and related information sorted by the feature value see the list of changes points in Figure 5 The system also provides more detail for each point in the form of a ratings graph along with the program guide information Refiltering with interactive feedback We can interactively add or change lters to discover additional patterns In the example shown in Figure 5 the object corresponding to weather reports ID  85 can be ltered out by adding a lter for object features This lter lets us analyze popular new topics after removing the noise from the weather report In this way numerous patterns of audience behavior can be discovered by combining various types of ltering with interactive feedback Figures 6 and 7 show examples of questions that can be asked to obtain knowledge from TV ratings data using our framework The rst three questions Q1–Q3 shown in Figure 6 represent an analysis for nding a particular pattern of a ratings increase for a specic category—here the categories were news dramas and variety shows In addition to the program category lter we used the lters that extract transitions made during a CF to focus on people’s interest in the program content For the news program Figure 6a we found that weather reports and sports news were popular For dramas Figure 6b scores for black and dominance computed from the brightness and saturation were the highest The example thumbnails indicate that scenes where the screen is heavily dark tend to be serious scenes during which viewers usually stay on that channel For variety shows Figure 6c we found that high entropy and amusement tend to increase TV ratings The example thumbnails indicate that lively scenes match the needs of people watching variety shows The difference in user behavior for variety shows versus dramas becomes clear when comparing the visualizations produced by our system In contrast to Q1–Q3 for our fourth question Q4 focuses on the decrease points see Figure 7a Because the initial statistics suggest that there’s a correlation between the color brown and decrease points we selected brown and found that people tended to switch the channels during news commentary and live televised broadcasts of parliament ary proceedings On the basis of the results we ltered out objects corresponding to news commentary and parliamentary proceedings to analyze other factors After ltering black seemed the most signicant feature By selecting and further analyzing this color feature we found that live broadcasts in the dark are also correlated with a ratings decrease For Q5 we tested whether animals inuence ratings see Figure 7b We rst compared the distribution of the scores for an animal between the increase and decrease points for certain categories and found that a difference was observed especially for variety shows To discover more about how an animal can contribute to TV ratings we used an animal lter with a threshold score of 0.3 Analyzing decrease points revealed that animals do indeed seem to inuence ratings except for animals in water For Q6 we targeted a specic event the ooding of the Kinugawa River to learn how viewers behaved following that event We searched for the target event by combining the following lters month program category and keywords The increase and decrease points revealed that people tended to watch live broadcasts and turn to other channels when live event coverage ends News Event Detection and Analysis We developed an application to detect news stories of interest by analyzing the set of change points in news programs We use increase points observed in two categories—news and informational programs—which reect viewers interest in news stories In addition to nding popular IEEE MultiMedia 50 


news topics our analysis revealed other valuable knowledge For example by comparing broadcasting times and ratings increases we could analyze whether the intention of TV stations matched the interests of viewers In addition analyzing audience behaviors when watching news about a disaster can help broadcasters and others determine how best to disseminate information regarding disaster preparedness to maximize who sees retains and acts on such information We detect news stories by analyzing keywords that co-occur with increase points We rst construct a graph from change points with each node corresponding to an increase point We can nd clusters that consist of multiple change points by mining the graph The clusters that contain the most increase points correspond to the news stories of most interest The details of the detection algorithms are described elsewhere 5 To evaluate whether our method could detect important news stories we used the top 10 news stories in Japan for 2015 as reported by the Yomiuri newspaper as the ground truth Table 3 shows the correspondence between the ground truth and our top 10 detected results The CP column shows the rank based on the number of change points in each detected news story This result shows our method detected ve of the 10 ground truth stories The Yomiuri rankings shows the big news stories in general while our rankings shows the news that viewers were most interested in because many people switch channels to a specic news story at the change point Our results revealed that viewers tended to switch the channel to negative news stories such as those about a murder or disaster to proactively collect more information about the specic news stories However viewers didn’t actively switch the channels to positive news stories such as those covering a Nobel Prize aware or the Rugby World Cup the viewers instead passively watched the stories Table 3 also shows the accumulated airtime of each news story The murder cases that were ranked in our results but not ranked by the      Q1: In what type of news are people interested Q2: What makes audiences watch drama Q3: What is the key indicator to increase ratings for variety shows  A: People are interested in weather reports and sports news  A: People tend to stay on a channel in serious scenes when the screen becomes dark  A: People want lively scenes with high entropy in variety shows Blue Black Entropy Amusement Dominance Weather  report Green Sports news Filter  news Filter  drama Filter  variey Filter  news, remove object \(85 Remove weather report a b c Figure 6 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to detect an increase in ratings for a specific category These examples answer questions about a news b drama and c variety shows April–June 2017 51 


Yomiuri newspaper the Osaka Kawasaki and Wakayama murder cases were ranked highly in airtime while the important news stories that were not detected by our method such as the launch of Hokuriku Shinkansen also received much airtime This indicates that TV stations broadcast important news stories equally to some extent regardless of people’s level of interest while news stories of public interest receive more airtime We also analyzed how the information related to a disaster is broadcast and viewed We compared the three disasters the ooding of the Kinugawa River on 10 September 2015 Figure 8a the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 Figure 8b and the Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake on 10 January 1995 Figure 8c We extracted the broadcasting time for each disaster with appropriate keywords and compared the three disasters using airtime and ratings within the broadcasting time Figure 8 shows the accumulated airtime per day and the highest per-minute rating in a day within broadcasting time for each of the three disasters Airtime is indicative of the TV stations intent while we used the highest per-minute rating to show what percentage of people watched news about the disaster that day This result shows that the ooding of the Kinugawa received the most airtime Figure 8a and many people watched the broadcast 26 percent which is signicantly high in Japan On the other hand the Great Hanshin Earthquake which occurred 20 years earlier was not as widely broadcast and thus had lower ratings Figure 8c Although ratings for the Great East Japan Earthquake which happened four years before the Kinugawa ooding are not as significant as for the ooding on that particular day 11 March 2011 TV stations spent a lot of time broadcasting the disaster and nearly 20 percent of potential viewers were watching Moreover this event occurred between two holidays which also might have been a contributing factor in terms of the number of people watching This suggests the intention of   Q4: When do people switch the channel in news programs Q5: Do animals inßuence ratings Q6: How did the audience behave when the Kinugawa River ßooded  A: People tend to switch channels during news commentary, parliamentary proceedings, and live broadcasts in the dark  A: Animals inßuence ratings, especially for variety shows, except for animals in water  A: People tended to watch live broadcasts and switch the channel when the scene changed Brown Distribution of animal scores for each program category News Blue Gray Example of increase points Example of decrease Information Drama Variety Black Blue Filter  news Filter  news reject object \(18, 82, 67 Filter  animal>0.3 Filter  news+information keyword \(Kinugawa Remove some objects a b c Figure 7 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to a detect a rating decrease for news programs b determine whether animals contribute to ratings and c detect audience behavior related to an event IEEE MultiMedia 52
