mining. However, the existing interpolation technique of missing data is not suitable for the flow data form of context information that does not make full use of data relevance between every collecting sensor. Moreover, that does not take Time-Space Relationship into account. In order to conquer the shortcomings and deficiencies of the existing interpolation technique of missing data, in this paper an interpolation technique for missing context data based on Time-Space Relationship and Association Rule Mining \(TSRARM proposed to perform spatiality and time series analysis on sensor data, which generates strong association rules to 
interpolate missing data. Finally, the simulation experiment verifies the rationality and efficiency of TSRARM through the acquisition of temperature sensor data. Experiments show that the algorithms are of high accuracy for the interpolation of missing context data, which are Simple Linear Regression SLR\lgorithm and the EM algorithm. In addition, it has smaller time and space overhead and can guarantee Quality of Service \(QoS\al-time applications Keywords- information processing; the Time-Space Relationship; Association Rule Mining \(ARM\rpolation for missing context data; Root Mean Square Error \(RMSE I  
 I NTRODUCTION  In the processing mechanism of context information, due to the complexity of real world, variability and limitations of human self-knowledge and subjectivity, it leads to a lot of uncertainty, inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent context information. The miss of context information may be attributable to clock synchronization error among sensors power failure of sensors, communications transmission errors, human attacks and so on, which is inevitable in the processing mechanism of context information The miss of sensor data, usually leads to bias of the accuracy of mining information, even produces serious error 
leading to system failures, thereby resulting in significant losses. Therefore, the interpolation technique for missing context data is the key technology for context information processing mechanism, the data completeness is prerequisite for high-level context information to generate intelligent decision At present, the commonly used methods for missing context data are linear regression interpolation [1 n e a r es t  neighbor regression  h o t p l a t e co ld p l at e r e g r e s s i o n t h e Maximum Expected EM algorithm  m a xi m u m l i ke l i hood regression[4,5  m u ltip le in t e r p o l a t i o n   6  7  Bay e sian n e tw o r k  statistical analysis[8 an d  o t h e r stat isti cal m e th o d s H o w e v e r   these methods do not take the characteristics of sensor data 
flow into account. The first prominent feature of sensor data is the strong associability, the second is the Time-Space Relationship characteristics among sensors. In addition recently the primary approach is the use of data mining particularly using the method based on association rules [9 10 A l t h o ugh t h e s e m e t h o d s t a ke  d a t a co nne c t i o n i n t o  account, it does not involve spatial-temporal characteristics among sensor data. In [12 t he spa t i a l t e m p ora l  characteristics of sensor data are just used to interpolate missing data, but it does not consider the relationship among sensor data. Therefore, the previous methods are incomplete 
which lack comprehensiveness and integration of missing data interpolation to meet the users In order to interpolate missing sensor data more accurately, in this paper an interpolation technique based on the two characteristics Time-Space Relationship and Association Rule Mining of sensor data is proposed, which aims at a class of sensor data for missing context data based on time-space relationship and association rule mining according to. And simultaneously the interpolation method of missing data is discussed comprehensively and he accuracy of the interpolation of missing sensor data is improved t The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2 
basic concepts and steps of association rules are introduced In Section 3 an interpolation technique for missing context data based on time-space relationship and association rule mining is proposed, and moreover the process of the interpolation is elaborated. In Section 4, the simulation results show that the technique for missing context data based on the time-space relationship and association rule mining is high-efficiency and rational. Finally, we conclude with a brief summary and future work in Section 5

II  A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING  A  The Concepts of Association Rule Mining Definition 1 Data Item: In the process of the sensor data acquisition, values which sensor X and Y collect can be discrete at different range according to the requirements of every user, that is the different particle size range, the discrete values is called data items of sensor. A set of several data items constitute the data items set. The number of data items involved in data items set is called dimension of data items set. The length m of the data items set is defined as the m-dimensional data items set Definition 2 Support: In wireless sensor networks, the support of association rule   is defined as the ratio of the number of same data items for every sensor X and Y collected within a certain period of time interval and the total number of sensor X and Y collected within the same time The support of data items set D is recorded as supp \(D\, the support of association rule   is usually recorded as supp Definition 3 Trust Value: In wireless sensor networks, for the sensors X and Y, the probability of the possibility which the data item collected by sensor X and simultaneously by sensor Y collected at a certain time interval is defined as trust value of association rules . With trust value definition the trust value can be represented by support as supp Definition 4 Minimum Supports: In practical applications, the minimum value of support of association rules according to the requirements of different users system which is the minimum value support to meet requirements of users, is defined as the minimum support, usually represented as minsupp Definition 5 Minimum Trust Value: In practical applications, the minimum value of trust-value of association rules according to the requirements of different users system which is the minimum trust-value to meet requirements of users, is defined as the minimum trust-value, usually represented as minconf Defined 6 Frequent Items Set: Given minimum support minsupp for the user, if the support of data items D colleted by sensor X is greater than the minimum support minsupp then it is called data item D as Frequent Items Set Simultaneously, the sensor X called as Frequent Node Set B  The concept of Association Rule Mining In the network of context information collection, for the sensors X and Y, the implication X Y is called association rule, where X and Y are collected by sensors X and Y respectively. Association rule is a simple and practical reasoning rule in Statistics, and it is also a hot research field in data mining, especially for the analysis of model relationship among large amounts of data items which appears frequently, consequently interpolates missing sensor data Support and trust value are greater than the user-defined minimum threshold of minsupp and minconf rules are commonly referred as strong association rules. The goal of association rule mining is to find out all strong association rule nodes from all the data items of given sensor node collected , to analysis the law from all data items collected by sensor nodes, thereby digging out the relationship and correlation among nodes, further to reason and predict for data item of nodes C  The basic process of association rules mining From the formal definition of mining association rules mining association rules usually can be divided into two basic processes 1\he finding of frequent sensor nodes For the minimum support minsupp which user sets, find all the frequent sensor node set from the sensor network system, which is the sensor node set meets that support is greater than or equal to minsupp. In fact, the frequent nodes set may be a certain relationship of reasoning. In general, we usually just consider the largest frequent sensor node set which are not reached by other sensor node sets. These frequent sensor node set is prerequisite for the formation of strong association rules 2\The formation of strong association rules For the minimum trust value minconf of user set according to a specific method, it generates association rules which trust value is greater than or equal to minconf in the larges frequent sensor node set, thus forms   implication strong association rules, reasons out relationship among sensor nodes and lay the foundation for interpolation of sensor missing data further III  A N I NTERPOLATION T ECHNIQUE FOR M ISSING C ONTEXT D ATA B ASED ON THE T IME S PACE R ELATIONSHIP AND A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING  Before In order to be more accurate of interpolation of missing context information, and to be closer to practical application, this paper introduces the concept of time freshness. For the sensor data sample sequence round number to be weighted, and to be time serialization according to the exponential 1 p 
003  is defined as the ratio of the number of data items with same weighted round number for every sensor X and Y collected within a certain period of time interval and the total number with same weighted round number of sensor X and Y collected within the same time. The weighted support of data items set D is recorded as wei_supp\(D\, the weighted support of association rule XY 003 is usually recorded as wei_supp XY 003  Definition of 8 Weighted Trust Value: In wireless sensor networks, for the sensors X and Y, at a certain time interval the probability of the possibility which the data item with weighted round number collected by sensor X and simultaneously by sensor Y collected is defined as weighted trust value of association rules XY 003 With weighted trust 
002 nsor data collected, the bigger data time freshness, the more weight the sensor data play. Therefore, the actual use of sensor data is more accurate and true. This paper also redefines the support and trust value called weighted support and weighted trust value mainly on account of the concept of time freshness Definition of 7 Weighted Support: In wireless sensor networks, the weighted support of association rule XY

value definition, the weighted trust value can be represented by weighted support as 
002 where p is the adjusting parameters, its value may be based on specific data characteristics Step 3 the finding of frequent data items set For the minimum support wei_minsupp which user set, the all finding the frequent sensor node set from the sensor network system is the sensor node set whose support is greater than or equal to wei_minsupp. In fact, the frequent nodes set may be a certain relationship of reasoning. Without loss of generality, we usually just consider the largest frequent sensor node set which is not reached by other sensor node sets. These frequent sensor node set is prerequisite for the formation of strong association rules Take temperature sensor acquisition data as example, as shown in Table 1. Suppose there are four sensors 1 S  2 S  3 S  4 S Assuming p = 3 and Round 4 appears missing data Assuming the minimum weighted support is 50%, and the minimum weighted trust value is 50%. Table 2 shows the closed Frequent data items set and the minimum weighted support are 1 S 73 3 S 75 4 S 63} = 2 1 S 73 4 S 63 3 2 S 63, S4.63} = 2 4 S 63} = 4 Step 4 The formation of strong association rules  For the minimum trust value wei_minconf which user set, generate association rules which trust value is greater than or equal to wei_minconf in the larges frequent sensor node set according to a specific method The specific operation of association rules concluded as follows

003 Similarly, you can define the minimum weighted support and minimum weighted trust value After dealing with sensor data through spatial-temporal the sensor data will be obtained again to conduct association rule mining. This paper use the method of non-redundant closed frequent data items set, thus saving computation time and memory space, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of the interpolation  of sensor missing data furthermore helping to the application of real-time system Definition of 9 Closed Data Items Set: In wireless sensor networks, data items set collected by sensor node set is set to   12   m Sss s  which is m-dimensional serial-number of sensor data items   12   n Uuu u  is the ndimensional data item values, then the data items can be formulated as P = SU, set A, B are subsets of data items serial-number, the number of A is k, then regard A as kitems data set, and the data flow sequence b collected by sensor is the subset of P, so the closed data items set is the sensor data sequence that meets the following functions f and g      f BiPbBib      g AbSiAib   is called the closed operation Definition of 10 Closed Frequency Data Items Set Suppose P is the closed data items set. If its weighted support is greater than or equal to the user-defined minimum weighted support, the P is the closed frequency data items set To weigh the sensor data sequence number \(round number\ it introduces the time freshness. While for spatial relationship among sensor data, we mainly conducting calculation of space similarity, which is the method of Pearson correlation coefficients, to find the closest space sensor data, and apply association rule mining Association rule mining algorithm is computationintensive algorithm. In order to reduce the computational complexity and improve the accuracy of missing context information interpolation, combined with the characteristics of sensor collection data, the first thing is to deal with the spatial-temporal data Step 1 sensor data spatiality: First, calculate space similarity for collected sensor data. In this paper, we use Pearson correlation coefficient method, which is usually used to calculate correlation degree between two variables ,that its value range is [-1 n d us e r d e f i n ed t h re shol d i s  o f t e n use d  such as the sensors of the Pearson correlation coefficient which is greater than or equal to 0.5 is usually used as Mining Association Rules Sensors S1, S2,... The data spatiality can reduce computational complexity, and it is beneficial to real-time applications, thus greatly improving the accuracy of data interpolation Similarity measuring formula i.e. Pearson correlation coefficient is usually used to measure similarity between sensors. Let  ij I be common set of sensor i and sensor j, then the similarity sim \(i, j\of sensor i and sensor j is    22         ij ij ij ic i jc j cI ic i jc j cI cI RRR R sim i j RR R R 004 004\004 212\212  212\212  Where  ic R is data item c collected by sensor i i R and j R represent respectively the average value of sensor i and sensor j The correlation coefficient value range is [-l, l  t h e l a r g er of correlation coefficient, the closer between two sensors and the higher accuracy of the acquisition data Step 2 sensor data time series analysis method: According to round for collected sensor data, and the acquisition data associated with time, we adds corresponding round weighed coefficient to every sensor data. On this basis, calculate the minimum weighted support and minimum weighted trust value. The lower time-sensitive sensor data is used to linear growth trend yax  and the high time-sensitive sensor data is used to exponential growth way. For example 1 n yapp

An interpolation technique for missing context data based on the Time-Space Relationship and Association Rule Mining \(TSRARM\ is proposed, which has higher accuracy compared with the traditional data interpolation methods, and reduces time and space overhead on the basis of relevance and spatial-temporal characteristics of sensor data flow. The experiments demonstrate that the method of TSRARM has much better performance than traditional method and other association rule mining method in terms of accuracy of data missing interpolation. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is rational and efficient Because of sensor data time series analysis is introduced if we adopt the exponential weighted, its value will increase exponentially and the data may be overflow. Therefore how to control the overflow of data is research work in future A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by Research Fund of the Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology No.20100393\, A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions R EFERENCES  1  Cool, A.

In this experiment to compare with our approach in mining frequent itemsets with constraint from LG A we incorporate C into the CharmL and Eclat \(well-known algorithms for mining frequent itemsets\. This is done easily by choosing only frequent items that are in C to work in the next steps of those algorithms. Those new versions are called C Charm, and C Eclat The items of the constraints are selected from the set A F  of all frequent \(corresponding to the minimum support MS items of A with the ratios of ¼, ½ and ¾. We have the constraints with the sizes of l 1  A F l 2  A F and l 3  A F For each l i  C is constructed from two subsets C   C 1  C 2 In the reality, the constraints that users are interested in usually contain the high-support items. Thus we will sort all items by th e order of their supports. To determine a constraint C with the size l i firstly, we construct the first subset C 1 of C containing [p*l i  t e m s  randomly selected from the set of high-support items in A F  where p 002 0  t h e r e m a i n e d p a r t  C 2 of C contains  [\(1p i   r a n d o m ly s e lec t e d ite ms f r o m  A F  C 1 For experiments at here, we set p = 0.5 and consider two constraints for each l i  We will do two comparisons. Firstly, in Table VI, we compare the average time for mining frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS  shown in column T C O   to  the one by C CharmGen column T C C upon P, M, Co, and Ch C CharmGen is the combination of C Charm \(for mining frequent closed itemsets with constraint\ and MinimalGenerators [19  f o r d e t e r m i n i ng t he i r g e ne ra t o rs    The reduction in the mining time is shown in column RT C O  RT C O T C C T C O With the different minimum support thresholds, we see that it is drastic, ranging from a factor of 60 to 316 times! That reduction plays an important role in mining quickly association rule with constraints because, as the discussion on [15, 6 a l l  a sso c i a t i o n  r u l e s c a n b e m i n e d  quickly from frequent closed itemsets and their generators TABLE VI  M INING FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS AND GENERATORS WITH CONSTRAINT   M INE _ CG _ CONS VS CCHARMGEN   DB MS T C C T C O RT C O  Co 75 1.07 0.005 213  65 1.29 0.013 99  55 3.49 0.026 134 Ch 65 1.21 0.011 115  55 6.08 0.055 111  50 10.93 0.111 98 P 80 1.50 0.010 145  70 13.74 0.115 120  65 39.22 0.243 161 M 15 0.16 0.003 60  5 0.84 0.003 316  1 4.80 0.018 264  In the second, the time for mining all frequent closed itemsets restricted on C by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS  is compared to the one by C Eclat We did experiments on on three databases \(that have many items\o, P, M. The reduction in the mining time by our approach is drastic. It ranges from a factor of 14 to 1063 times and is shown in Fig 5               Figure 5  The reduction in mining time all frequent itemsets with constraint MINE_FS_CONS vs C Eclat  For database P, the reductions are small because the average size of transactions is small compared with the number of all items. Then, practically \(users are usually interested in high-support items\, we should consider the constraints containing many high-support items. Indeed, the bigger of the number of high-support items \(corresponding with the big values of p\ are, the bigger reductions become Table VII showed that. In addition, the output of our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS is classified into disjoint classes. All frequent itemsets with constraint in a class have

and wheezes. That rule consist of eight attributes; gender occupation, diabetes type, cholesterol level, sodium level diastolic blood pressure, edema and wheezes. Using those attributes, a decision tree was generated which is shown in figure 3 Wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. As shown in figure 3, the association rule can be easily proven by the use of this decision tree. In the tree the highest numbers of records are shown under the attributes values which were given by the association rule. That node contains 1218 records from the whole data set and that is the highest number of values in the whole decision tree By this decision tree the association rule can be proved Figure 1. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and edema 374 and that increases the validity of the rule which shows that people who have diabetes type 2, who are female housewives, having normal range of sodium level and diastolic blood pressure and who has edema and has low cholesterol level are having a higher probability of getting Wheezes Gender=F occupation=Housewife Sodium Level=135145 diastolic=60-80 cholesterol <5.17 edema = Yes diabetesType=Type 1 ==> wheezes=Yes conf :\( 0.95 Second association rule selected for diabetes type 1 discovered a relationship between diabetes type 1 and wheezes and that rule was almost similar to the rule generated for diabetes type 2 The decision tree in figure 4 was generated by using the attributes in the association rule and from that the rule can be proved. Here wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. The edema has the highest number of records than all the other nodes So, another important thing that can be identified by this tree is; the people who have diabetes and edema have the highest probability for originating wheezes than people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes 3 and FBS level After generating decision trees with different attribute 


combinations, one was selected as the optimal decision tree which contains the best attribute combination. When analyzing this decision tree there was a branch which has the attribute combination as BMI= 18.5-24.9, Occupation=Housewife, Gender Female, Systolic blood pressure= 90- 120, Diastolic blood pressure= 60-80 There were 600 records in the selected dataset which belong to the patients who are housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg. Out of those patients there were 494 patients whose FBS level was above 125 mg/dl. It was out of the 1947 patients who have more than 125 mg/dl FBS level This attribute combination was selected as the best combination among all the combinations in this tree because it was the attribute combination which the highest number of patients had and among them about 83% had more than 125 mg/dl FBS level Because of these reasons it can be proved that the people who are the housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9 systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg have  highest risk of having more than 125 FBS level. But these BMI range Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are the normal levels which should be there in the human body When analyzing much more about this the best rule generated by the decision tree, with the patients dataset, it was identified that 93.82% of those patients were in the range of 39  75 years. Therefore the age which has most possibility of having more than 125 FBS level can be proved as more than 39 years Also in the dataset 85.90% of the patients with this attribute combination had wheezes. Patients with above attributes and age range of 39-75 years, 76.72% had wheezes. As mentioned in earlier sections, as well as results generated by the association rules also prove this situation that there is a link between wheezes and increased FBS level Also among the patients with above attribute collection there were 95.87% patients with primary or secondary education level. Therefore it can be said that, when the education level is low of a person it affects his FBS level in 


blood. The reason for that can be not having enough knowledge about the necessary life style needed to control the sugar level The best finding is that there patients with attribute combination generated by decision tree were 100% females The decision tree generated to further analyze the relationship between gender and FBS level is shown in figure 5 When considering the decision trees generated to analyze the probability of gender in different attribute combinations, in most of the times WEKA did not even generated the tree. The reason is that, when designing the tree, WEKA selects the best attributes to split the data records at the top of the decision tree to get the possibilities Figure 2. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and edema Figure 3. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and wheezes 375 of the particular attribute. When considering attribute Gender, female has the highest possibility than male Therefore there is no reason to do the splitting any more Association rules that generated regarding the gender and both diabetes types also proved that when the other attributes are in normal levels gender becomes the major attribute of increasing the possibility of having Diabetes The overall conclusion which can be obtained through this is, the patients who are female housewives having wheezes, BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg has the most possibility of more than 125 mg/dl in the FBS level. Because the BMI range, Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are in the normal levels; the gender of female, aged between 39-75 years, education level only having primary or secondary education and having wheezes become the major decision factors of high FBS level V. DISCUSSION Following section is about the problems encountered and issues faced when doing the project and key contributions of the research towards the diabetes field and research community A. Problems Faced When considering the phase 2 of the research there were 


several problems with the WEKA software, when generating the decision tree. The content of the window which displays the generated decision tree cannot be zoomed out/in according to the requirement of the user. Therefore it was difficult to view and analyze the generated decision trees with all its' branches according to the needs. Also the generated decision tree could not copy to another application. Therefore generating an image of a large decision trees were impossible B. Key contributions of the research One of the key contributions of this research is to identify hidden risk factors of Diabetes. The other key contribution is to identify whether there is any possibility to increase the Diabetes risk level when different combinations of risk factors are taken together The value of these key contributions can be described focusing different end users such as physicians and the people who have or who do not have Diabetes. For example after experimentally proving the results of this research, the doctors will be able to exactly say how much of possibility a person has to get Diabetes and other diseases which occur as side effects of Diabetes. Other than that the patient will be able to get a brief idea of whether he would get Diabetes in the future or whether he already has Diabetes in his body without his knowledge VI. CONCLUSION This paper discussed the utilization of classification techniques and association rules generation to identify the undiscovered decision factors of diabetes and the effects of diabetes Phase 1 of this research included the preliminary findings of the generation and analysis of the association rules. After the association rules generation, to further improve the reliability of the results, classification approach was used This paper covered the phase 2 of the research which covers the application of classification techniques. The conclusions which can be made through phase 1 and phase 2 are stated below A relationship between edema and diabetes has been identified from the association rules generation. The results obtained from the decision tree analysis also clearly state that, the probability of occurring edema for both diabetic 


type patients will increase if they have wheezes. From the decision trees generated for edema and both diabetes types it can be concluded that, wheezes will more affect towards developing edema for both diabetic types than the other attributes A strong relationship between wheezes and diabetes also identified with association rules. Currently in the medical field, no relationship is identified between wheezes and diabetes. The decision tree analysis regarding this aspect discovered that the diabetic patients who are suffering from edema have the highest probability for developing wheezes than the people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes In the previous phase of this research, a high risk for women towards diabetes was identified than men. Another conclusion obtained was, when the BMI range, systolic BP Blood Pressure normal levels, females with only primary or secondary Figure 5.    Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and gender.Figure 4. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and wheezes 376 education aged between 39-75 years, and having wheezes will have a high risk towards developing high FBS levels All the above discovered relationships are true for both Diabetes type 1 and type 2. But Diabetes type 1 has a stronger relationship with all those factors than type 2 Currently in the medical field, none of the above discovered information was proved except the relationship between diabetes and edema. Since a strong relationship between diabetes and edema was identified through the data mining techniques, other rules also have a higher possibility of proven by the real world experiments All the conclusions of the entire research were generated through data mining process and evaluated through the related literature and the domain experts knowledge. But they must be   validated through real life applications and medical experiments. That is the major future work to be done for this research ACKNOWLEDGMENT Our sincere gratitude goes to Dr. H. A.
