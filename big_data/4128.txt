With huge amount of data on internet, web data mining has become very significant Web Usage helps companies to produce productive information pertaining to the future of their business function ability by analyzing the usage information from their websites. Sequential 
Patterns allow the collection of web access data for web pages This usage data provides the paths leading to accessed web pages and their sequences which can give us valuable information about user’s behavior and effectiveness of websites. The focus of this survey paper is to review the challenges, issues and techniques for finding sequential patterns in the context of web usage mining For this, different techniques from the literature have been reviewed.  Analysis of the existing techniques related to the sequential pattern finding has been done on the basis of the existing literature and some parameters are proposed. The comparison criteria for the analysis include Graph Structure Input Data Structure, Input Parameters, Pattern Type Application, Technique, Method, Algorithm, Scalability and Tool Support. The reviewed techniques are divided into three groups 
Clustering; Association; Markov Model based techniques. By analyzing all the techniques with the help of above defined parameters, compare and contrast we finally conclude that the two clustering techniques based on Markov Models \(Line Prediction and Path Analysis Using Markov Chains & Using Markov Chains for Structural Link Prediction for Adaptive Web Sites\roposed by Sarukkai  & Zhu et al. respectively, are the best sequential pattern finding techniques. Analyzing different techniques also show that the hybrids of different techniques can be used to find sequential patterns in web usage mining data Strength and weaknesses of one technique can complement of the other technique so it is best to use techniques in combination if we want accurate patterns efficiently Keywords- Sequential patterns; Clustering; Association 
Rules; Markov Model; Web Usage Mining    I   I NTRODUCTION  Internet has become perhaps the biggest searching tool in today’s age now. People want to enhance their businesses electronically. However, E-businesses may not just build a web site and then sit back and pick the benefits, which, in most cases, is unrewarding. People have to implement web mining systems to understand their customers' profiles and identify strengths and weaknesses of their E-marketing efforts on the web through continuous improvements I n t e r n e t i s  a g o l d  mine, but only for those companies who realize the importance of Web mining and adopt a Web mining strategy now [25  Web Mining is the integration of information collected from the traditional data mining methodologies with information 
collected over the World Wide Web \(WWW\. It is used to understand the user’s behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of the web sites. Useful hidden information can be used to discover the visitor’s profile and can also measure online marketing efforts Web mining can be divided into three categories; Web Content Mining \(WCM\Web Structure Mining \(WSM Web Usage Mining \(WUM\. WCM is used to discover useful information from text, graph, audio or video data in the web WSM describes the organization of data from web structures XML or HTML tags. There are two types of WSM, one is intra-structure \(hyperlinks with in page\ and other is interstructure \(hyperlinks from one page to other page\. WUM is the process of finding user’s intention and data from the web logs, for example; IP Address, time and date. It helps to find the search patterns for a particular user’s group We b 
Usage Mining \(WUM\echniques provide knowledge about the behavior of the users in order to extract relationships in the recorded date. So focus of this paper is on WUM. It is used to find the access patterns from the web. It exposes the usage pattern with cluster mining, association rules mining and sequential pattern mining. According to Jain & Dubes [22  clustering is an unsupervised technique; by using it we can group a given collection of objects into meaningful clusters According to Mobasher et al. [23 as s o ciation ru le m i n i ng identifies the associations among the dataset, so a subset of transactions implies that presence of other also. These techniques are more frequently used for web usage mining  rt h a K o u t ri et al def i n e t h e w e b u s a g e m i ni ng proces s as given in Figure   Fi g ure 1 Web Usa g e Minin

In this paper, our focus is only on the sequential pattern mining techniques. Agrawal et al. [2  def i n e a p r ob l e m of  finding inter-transaction patterns. Under this context, a pattern is an ordered list of sets of items. In sequential pattern, we identify frequently occurring event sequences \(temporal patterns\ in the data. This technique is very useful for the identification of navigational patterns. We can discover sequential patterns by using two methods, by using deterministic techniques \(recording the navigational behavior of the user\and stochastic methods \(use the sequence of web pages that have been visited in order to predict subsequent visits\ [2  W e ha ve  co nsi d er ed t w o d a t a s o urc e s  w e b l ogs and databases. Data is automatically generated and stored in server access logs, referrer logs, agent logs and client side cookies. We are not considering the preprocessing step; we assume that it has done already This paper extracts absolute information as stated by the authors of proposed approach and then we analyze it on our extracted parameters. In Section II we explain the main points of all the surveyed techniques individually. In Section III assessment criteria for the analysis of techniques has been defined, in section IV the surveyed techniques are discussed and their analysis has been done based on the identified parameters, and in section V, the survey is concluded. An analysis matrix based on our analysis has been given in Table I II  S URVEYED T ECHNIQUES  Sequential Pattern techniques can be deterministic techniques which record the navigational behavior of the user and stochastic techniques that use the sequence of Web pages that have been visited in order to predict subsequent visits Markov models are the widely adopted models for sequential pattern discovery for link prediction due to their suitability to modeling sequential processes. Different variations of Apriorilike algorithms have also been adopted in most of the techniques related to the mining of sequential patterns for WWW. Our survey contains the following techniques Chen et al. [1 in tr o d u c ed th e  con c e p t of  maximal forward references The Maximal Forward \(MF\ references algorithm aims at converting the original sequence of Web server logs into a set of traversal patterns based on statistically dominant paths and association rules. MF references can be defined as the sequence of documents requested by a user up to the last one before backtracking. The approach proposed works in two steps. The first one is the MF algorithm. In the second step they proposed two more algorithms. One determines the large reference sequences using hashing and pruning techniques and the other further improves it in terms of the database scans The selective scan option is the strength of their technique [1   Pei et al. [2 in tr o d u c e d th e  WAP-mine algorithm in which mining is performed in a Web access sequence database to depict access patterns. The length of web log pieces can be very long in web mining and it can be in a huge number.  They use a conditional search strategy and a proposed WAP-tree structure The WAP-tree stores complex and critical information for web access pattern mining. It stores all count information for pattern mining and thus makes mining process free from counting candidates by pattern matching. The search strategy WAP-mine is proposed to mine non-redundant web access patterns. The WAP-mine algorithm is faster than the conventional Apriori based techniques of web access patterns mining. The WAP-mine and GSP algorithm [1 r e com p ar ed  and it is seen that Web-mine surpass GSP in term of scalability Mortazaviasl et al. [3 in t r odu ce d th e i d e a  of  p r og res s iv ely  partitioning the database of user sequences into smaller subdatabases for mining sequential patterns. They introduced a new projection-based algorithm for mining sequential patterns called the PrefixSpan It uses the frequent sequence trellis to partition the database. It traverses the frequent item lattice level-by-level in depth-first order. PrefixSpan exhibit a greater selectivity while in the FreeSpan it is not guaranteed that a projected database would shrink in size or not. Because of changing business needs some sequential patterns become invalid  and some needs to be updated which are not solved with Prefix Span Inokuchi et al n t r od uce d a s t a ndar d f o r r e vea l i n g  patterns that frequently appear in structured data. The proposed algorithm extends Apriori algorithm and uses a graph structure which allows the ability to reveal patterns from graph structured data. Furthermore, it has the ability to find frequent sub graphs from both directed and undirected graph structured data having with labeled or unlabeled nodes and links According to the authors, this approach may be applied for the analysis of user browsing behavior. The generalization of the adjacency matrix representation and the extension to the other class of sub graphs and mining criteria are the open issues in this technique Conventional mining works on minimum support based approaches for specifying patterns of interest which is very restrictive. Garofalakis et al. [5  p r es en te d a dif f e ren t a p p r o ach  in which the SPIRIT family of algorithms has been developed for mining frequent sequential patterns. These algorithms shore up the user-specified constraints for the resulting patterns and the user-specified value for the support threshold. The constraints are given with a flexible constraint specification language with regular expressions. This helps the miners to get more focused and accurate results according to their needs. The degree to which the RE constraints can be enforced to prune the search space of patterns during computation is the distinguishing factor of this approach [5  Another user-specified time constraints approach has been proposed by Masseglia et al. [6  In th is a p p r o a ch s p e c if ic ati o n  of minimum and maximum time gaps among web log entries are required by the user. The processing of user access data is performed by using the GENERAL algorithm, a variation of the GSP algorithm f o r fi nd i ng ge n e ra l i z e d s e q u e n t i a l  patterns. WebTool is the tool proposed by the authors for applying data mining techniques like association rules or sequential patterns on web access logs. Markov modeling for Web data was introduced in 1995 by Bestavros et al T h e y  employ a first-order hidden Markov model in order to predict the successive link that a user might follow within a certain period of time Sarukkai use s Ma r k o v  cha i ns t o m o de l seq u e n c e s  o f  Web pages. Markov chain can be constructed using training 


data and then further refined from client/server histories. They are used to determine next page, based on current one.  A probability distribution over preceding links in the user's browsing history is utilized in order to assign weights to preceding” links, and thus create the best predictors of the subsequent links. The technique is not best suited for smaller applications. No comparison to other technique is given and processing time and bandwidth is not considered. The approach is statistical by nature and Markov Chain matrix becomes very large A similar approach to Sarukkai is applied by Zhu et al. [8 in which the referrer information from the log file, the page that the user has followed in order to arrive at the requested page has also been utilized. An algorithm for transition probability matrix compression is used to cluster Web pages with similar transition behaviors. The algorithm compresses the transition matrix to a best possible size for efficient probability calculation in link prediction. MF approach is then applied to improve efficiency of link prediction. The link prediction is checked in the system ONE \(Online Navigation Explorer The link prediction can be further improved by identifying users’ goal in each visit”[8 If compared with the approach of Sarukkai  t h i s  a ppro a c h ca n pr ed i c t m o r e st ep s i n  t h e fut u re  Different Markov models are used for different clusters in order to characterize and visualize the navigational behavior of various types of user. Anderson et al. [9 u s e  a m i x t u r e of a  first-order Markov models to describe the browsing behavior of Web users and predict subsequent requests. The paper focuses on the wireless web navigation. An algorithm MINPATH is proposed which automatically improves wireless web navigation. It suggests useful shortcut links  in real time by using a learned model of web visitor behavior to estimate the savings of shortcut links. It suggests best links. A mixture of predictive models like Naive Bayes models and mixtures of Markov models are used. MINPATH finds useful shortcuts when used with these models and thus save extensive navigational effort. The scalability of MINPATH is to be checked on the larger fielded websites Spiliopoulou et al used  t h e i r Web U t i l i z a t i o n M i ner WUM\ool for sequential pattern discovery Given a number of traversed paths, discover sub paths with structural and statistical properties of interest 10  is th e m a in th e m e  addressed in this approach. The MINT Processor module of WUM extracts sequence rules from the pre-processed Web log data. Human experts can define constraints and the MINT processor provides interactive mining. The aggregate data is used for the mining purpose which considerable reduces the size of the dataset under processing. The MINT mining language is used for the interaction, which facilitates pattern specification in an SQL-like format. This language helps in specifying the content, the structure and the statistics of navigation patterns. The semi-automated discovery process is supported by WUM can be a disadvantage when required to use in fully automated web personalization system. The WUM is appropriate not only for the websites but also for any kind of patterns discovery [1  Paliouras et al. [11  p r op os e d a m e t h od f o r d i s c ov e r i n g  navigational patterns using clustering. User sessions are represented by the transitions between pages which are performed during the session. User sessions represented in this manner are then clustered to produce community models which correspond to the navigational behavior of users. Hit rate and the site size effects the scalability of methods. The approach is tested on a single website so more study is required to check it with different other websites. Also, the attribute and threshold selection is manual. Only limited and first-order modeling of the sequential patterns can be performed but the approach can produce interesting navigational patter  Borges et al. [12 pr es en t e d a  s t och a s t ic ap p r oach  f o r  sequential pattern finding from user sessions. They are modeled using a hypertext probabilistic grammar. Web pages are represented by non-terminal symbols links between web pages are represented by production rules and sequences of web pages are represented by strings according to the rules of this grammar. A directed-graph breadth-first search algorithm, using pre-specified threshold values for support and confidence is then used in order to identify user navigation sessions that are included in the hypertext grammar and describe the users’ browsing behavior. They propose the use of entropy as an estimator. The output of this algorithm strongly depends upon the selected values of the input parameters, such as the confidence. According to authors, their model is self contained, coherent and compact. The approach can be helpful not only for website designers to understand the preferences of visitors but also for the individual users to understand navigational patterns and increase knowledge of the web contents [12  III  E VALUATION C RITERIA  The assessment criteria for the current survey include Graph Structure, Input Data Structure, Input Parameters Pattern Type, Application, Technique, Method, Algorithm Scalability and Tool Support. Some of these evaluation criteria are extracted from the literature review of the already existing papers and some are proposed by us   Graph Structure If a technique considers a graph structure for data it is regarded as Yes, and No otherwise   Pattern’s Type This parameter tell that the proposed technique identifies which kind of patterns Comments/type of pattern identified is written under this heading   Algorithm The name of algorithm which has been proposed for finding sequential patterns   Input Parameters The type of parameters defined by data miner empirically for the proposed technique    Input Data Structures The type of the data structure which is used o take input i.e. log file or database     Applications The type of applications for which these techniques are proposed   Techniques This parameter identifies the technique according to one of our three defined groups i.e Association rule mining clustering or Markov Chain    Methods Techniques are divided into two types of methods.

use the sequence of web pages that have been visited in order to predict subsequent visits   Tool Tool Support means either the proposed techniques has some tool developed for the mining sequential patterns or not. It is also checked whether a tool support is possible In this regard the experimental results have been checked   Scalability It refers to the ability of mining sequential patterns to support a large and complicated data sources The factor is categorized as Yes or No in the comparison table to differentiate between techniques on the basis of performance by ensuring if a particular technique can gracefully handles the increase in size of data source IV  A NALYSIS  Chen et al. [1 in t r o d u c ed th e con c e p t of  maximal forward references which can be describe as the sequences of user’s request documents  up to the last one before backtracking. The aim of Maximal forward references algorithm is to convert the original sequences of web logs into set of traversal patterns based on association rules and dominant path.  Options of selective scan are very useful and can help to improve the performance To expose access patterns using a conditional search strategy, Pie et al. [2  in tr odu ce d a WAP-mine algorithm They also proposed a WAP-tree This method is faster than conventional methods WAP-mine is efficient than GSP-based solution in a wide margin. Mortazaviasl et al. [3 t r o d u ce d  a  novel projection based algorithm PrefixSpan, which support sequential patterns mining. They basically worked on partitioning the database of user sequences into smaller databases for mining sequential patterns The approach introduced by Inokuchi et al. [4 u s ed f o r  the analysis of user’s browsing behavior. The generalization of the adjacency matrix representation and the extension to the other class of sub graphs and mining criteria are the open issues in this technique Apriori like family of algorithm \(SPIRIT family proposed by Garofalakis et al  w h i c h i s us e d f o r m i ni ng  sequential patterns. These algorithms support user threshold and user specified constraints for the resulting patterns. These user constraints are given in the form of regular expressions as an input. This gives data miner an opportunity to narrow results according to his requirement by applying these constraints For the enhancement of user constraints Masseglia et al 6  pr o p o s e d an a p p r o ach w h er e u s er  re qu i r es s p e c if ic ati o n  of  minimum and maximum time gaps among web log entries GENERAL algorithm is used for the processing of user access data.

To predict the subsequent link within a certain period of time that a user might follow, the first-order Markov model is used. A probability distribution over preceding links in the user's browsing history is utilized in order to assign weights to preceding links, and thus create the best predictors of the subsequent links. The technique is not best suited for smaller applications [7 Zhu et al 8  p r e s e n t e d a similar approach who in addition exploited the web pages that the user has accessed to reach at the requested page. An algorithm for transition probability matrix compression is used to cluster web pages with similar transition behaviors Anderson et al.

For the discovery of sequential patterns Web Utilization Miner \(WUM\ol is used. For the extraction of sequence rules from the web log data, a MINT processor module of WUM is used. A semiautomated discovery process when used for the personalization is a disadvantage for this technique According to the Paliouras et al c l ust e r i ng sh o u l d be allowed to overlap facts. On the basis of quality of the community models, they proposed and evaluated their approach. These criteria are independent of the clustering method and make no assumption of non overlapping clusters A limited first-order modeling pattern is the disadvantage of this approach Borges et al. [12  p r o p o s e d a n ap p r oach f o r th e ex tr act ion  of sequential patterns from the user sessions. Hypertext probabilistic grammar is used for modeling. One advantage of this approach is the automatic generation of navigational paths It requires heuristics for output refinement which can be a disadvantage. It is efficient but the output depends on the selected values of the input parameters e.g. confidence A  Compare and Contrast We have divided the surveyed techniques into association rule mining, clustering and markov chain models and the compare and contrast is done according to it 1  Association Rules Mining echniques[1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12  In these association rule mining techniques 4 10  consider graph structures but the other techniques [1, 2, 3, 5, 6 a ha v e n o t used g r ap h s t r u c t u r e  T h e i n p u t  d a t a st r u c t ur e used by [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 i s a l m o st  s a m e  T h re sho l d i n put  parameter is supported by [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12 t e c hni q u e s and    used a b unc h o f  t r a v er sed p a t h s a s i n p u t pa ra m e t e r T h e focus of all these techniques is to find the frequent sequential patterns from the input data structures.

In all the other remaining techniques some do not use graph structure, some of them do not support scalability and some lack tool support V  C ONCLUSION  Web usage mining is an emerging area to find the access patterns from the web. Access patterns can provide the valuable information about user behaviors, life time value of customers cross marketing strategies across products, and effectiveness of promotional campaigns.  We focused on web usage mining techniques in this survey paper and reviewed the challenges issues and techniques for finding sequential patterns. We divided the techniques in three groups i.e. Clustering Association and Markov Model based techniques. Our findings indicate that clustering is the best choice for sequential pattern mining and the techniques by Sarukkai [7 Zhu e t  a l    8  based on Markov Models and are the best according to our assessment criteria. We have further analyzed that the hybrids of different techniques can also be used to find sequential patterns in web usage mining data to gain more efficient results.
