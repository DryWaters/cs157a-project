INTRODUCTION This case study describes the successful implementation of a high-level financial reporting system at NASA called the Agency Budget Execution Dashboard \(ABED authors  who have been actively involved in deploying and operating this system  hope that this study provides insights and lessons learned about the enablers and critical success factors which are applicable to the implementation of other large scale management systems In November 2007 NASA  s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer \(CFO Johnson Space Center \(JSC ARC agency-wide financial dashboard. While the JSC team  1 978-1-4244-3888-4/10/$25.00  2010 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper# 1123, Version 1, Updated October 29, 2009 agreed to deliver a web-based interface to display high-level  traffic light  indicators for tracking performance variances of Space Missions and NASA Centers, the ARC team was mandated with collecting all Agency phasing plans processing financial actuals, and delivering monthly reports showing plans versus actuals charts The two teams were contacted because they had produced technologies in the past, which seemed to be feasible for building the ABED. The JSC team had created and operated the Integrated Budget Office Toolbox \(IBOT system to support budget planning and analysis. The ARC team had developed and used the Program Management 


team had developed and used the Program Management Tool \(PMT tool suite using spreadsheets as the main user interface [1 PMT also already had available a reliable connection to NASA  s accounting system to access obligation, cost, and workforce actuals The two teams completed the development of the ABED within two months, and after only five months, the fully operational dashboard became available to the end users. It was used  officially  as early as mid-April 2008 when the Agency CFO conducted the monthly Budget Process Review \(BPR management, for the first time in the history of the Agency had access to a single integrated management system to monitor monthly plan versus actual reports for any mission center, or project 2. ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS The Office of the Chief Financial Officer \(OCFO implemented the ABED within the broader context of supporting NASA  s financial performance goals [2 The primary objective was to significantly enhance the agency  s financial performance in terms of using available funds more efficiently. As shown in Figure 1, historically NASA had an increasing problem with obligating funds in a timely manner. The amount of un-obligated funds that needed to be carried over from one fiscal year into the next surpassed 10% of NASA  s annual budget  a fact that was under close scrutiny by the U.S. Congress and Office of Management and Budget \(OMB 2  Figure 1  NASA  s Un-obligated Funds [2 Therefore, the OCFO decided to focus on the near term objective to reduce the amount of un-obligated funds3 to less than $ 1 billion in fiscal year \(FY was intended to become the single source of reference for monitoring and managing the budget execution process by providing reliable and timely information on cost and obligation plans and on the variances between plans and actuals. The tool should become available to a large number of resources and program executives in the Mission Directorates and Space Centers \(that is the 10 major NASA centers nation-wide manage their funds One challenge for the ABED was to support a single integrated, comprehensive agency phasing plan process Before this initiative, NASA had lacked an integrated phasing plan system. Instead, plans were collected locally in the Space Centers and then forwarded to the Mission Directorates. However, the plan numbers differed significantly in terms of quality, content, and granularity to the point that plans from different centers could not be aggregated at the agency level. By the same token, mission directorates used different concepts for tracking actual costs costs vs. total calculated cost serious barriers for managing budget execution goals centrally and agency-wide The implementation of a unified phasing plan system and process had to reflect NASA  s matrix organization \(see Figure 2 Space Centers were responsible for creating the plans bottom-up, the product organizations \(Mission Directorates ultimate owners of the plans, responsible to Congress for their budget execution. Therefore, a multi-step process was implemented that required the Centers and Mission Directorates \(MDs order to refine the initial plan submissions \(see Figure 3  3 In the accounting system used by the U.S. government the spending of funds is tracked along a four-step budget execution process: \(1 


funds is tracked along a four-step budget execution process: \(1 Commitments: administrative reservations of funds, \(2 amounts of orders placed, contracts awarded, \(3 products received, \(4   Figure 2  NASA as a Matrix-Organization  Figure 3  NASA  s Phasing Plan Process Given the urgency of the organizational objective to reduce un-obligated funds, the ABED needed to be developed and implemented as fast as possible. One approach to accomplish this was to integrate with existing systems. For displaying cost and obligation actuals, ABED needed to connect with the agency  s accounting system. For collecting the plan data, ABED needed to accept outputs from existing center systems The OCFO decided that it was unreasonable to replace existing center systems since they were well integrated with other management processes such as funds control and various local reporting functions. In addition, leaving the existing systems in place helped minimize time and efforts for training and system implementation 3. IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS The ABED was fully deployed on April 14th, 2008 only five months after the first conversations with OCFO. It was used as early as April 17th when the Agency CFO conducted the 3 Budget Process Review \(BPR BPR were all Deputy Center Directors, Center CFOs, and senior management from all Mission Directorates. Since then, the dashboard reports were not only used for the monthly BPRs, but also for the Agency Management and Operations meetings and monthly Agency Resources Management Performance Reports, which were distributed to staff at each Center, Headquarters Office, and Mission Directorate. For the first time, senior executives and resources managers had a single reference for the agency  s budget performance data The successful implementation of the ABED was one element that contributed to a remarkable turnaround in NASA  s resource management performance. In fiscal year 2008, NASA was able to far surpass its target of reducing the un-obligated funds below $ 1 billion. In fact the agency ended the year with just $ 535 million of un-obligated funds In fiscal year 2009, that figure was further reduced by nearly 50% to $ 278 million \(see figure 4 Agency saw a reduction in programmatic un-costed funds down to $ 731 million as resource performance focus shifted to cost execution \(see section 5. below 1,511 1,833 2,101 2,100 2,086 535 278 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500  M il li o n s 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Fiscal Year  Figure 4  Reduced Un-obligated Funds [5 


Figure 4  Reduced Un-obligated Funds [5 4. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS The successful development, implementation, and operation of the ABED was based on a large set of enablers and success factors which can be grouped into three categories  project management, organizational factors and technology development Project Management The success of this project was unequivocally due to clearly defined goals and to differentiated leadership roles The final deliverable of this project was defined within the first two weeks into the project in November 2007, and it was never changed  Provide a [Budget Execution Dashboard to the Agency OCFO by the end of January based on the concepts already in use at JSC along with the inclusion of reports based on Ames  PMT capabilities. The dashboard is a status tool reporting plans, actuals, and variances  This definition already implies an implementation strategy that explicitly utilizes existing technology as building blocks of an innovative solution. In the academic management literature, this approach is called bricolage [5]. It refers to an improvisational approach that  makes do with the means or resources at hand  6]. It was the combination of clear goals and bricolage in the project execution that allowed the project team to deliver a final product within only six months Committed project managers and senior executive support are crucial for any large-scale organizational change project In this case, the agency CFO was the initiator and sponsor of the project. He stayed strongly involved throughout the implementation, and he personally made all decisions over any significant changes in scope or schedule. The CFO took on the role of leading all senior-level discussions with Mission Directorates and center management and enforcing the implementation of ABED throughout the entire organization The CFO also mandated the newly assigned director and assistant director of Office of Performance Reporting to facilitate the data collection for the dashboard: in particular the phasing plan collection. They became the expert facilitators. As outlined above, the phasing plan process was not only essential to the success of the system, but also the most complicated in terms of coordinating hundreds of resource managers throughout the matrix organization. The individual Space Centers were able to continue using their local and familiar tools. However, significant changes in their work practices needed to be made to satisfy the new standardized set of data requests. The Office of Performance Reporting supported this process by developing detailed instructions for the process, schedule and data standards, as well as by facilitating weekly phone conferences, which were open to all participants. These open forums were key to gaining the necessary momentum for overcoming all the obstacles and concerns along the way Organizational Factors The strongest driver behind the successful implementation was a clear and externally relevant agency goal: namely, to reduce the un-obligated funds significantly \(see above agency  s standing with the U.S. Congress and the OMB was dependent on accomplishing this objective. It was hard to argue that NASA would need more funding if at the same time a large amount of money circulated unused within the agency. The reduction of un-obligated funds provided a strong reason for the Mission Directorates and Space Centers to fully participate in the deployment and use of the ABED 4 Strong visibility of the progress towards this goal reinforced the significance of this matter and allowed project and resources managers throughout the agency to take proactive 


resources managers throughout the agency to take proactive actions as soon as the plan variances surpassed certain critical thresholds. The OCFO defined a unified set of variance thresholds that applied to every Space Center and Space Mission. The thresholds were displayed in the dashboard as so-called  traffic lights  that is as red, yellow and green color indicators. This method allowed an easy tracking of  red  outliers and facilitated a management-byexception approach, as shown in Figure 5  Figure 5  ABED with  Traffic-Light  Indicators In addition to the dashboard, which was accessible without restrictions to any resources manager within the organization, the OCFO developed the monthly Agency Resource Management Performance Reports [4]. These publications were issue-oriented \(top 10 issues   red  performance areas highlighted performance benchmarks. Broadening the distribution and utilizing the performance reports beyond the OCFO community focused more management attention on budget execution performance than in prior years  Figure 6  Detailed Plan versus Actual Reports The OCFO also initiated a tightly woven communications network by establishing over 70 budget execution and procurement focal points at every Space Center and Mission Directorate office. This resulted in a highly effective bottom-up campaign directed at ensuring efficient and effective use of all resources during the financial year Technical Factors The tight development and implementation schedule required a highly flexible technology that could easily connect with existing systems. Conventional relational databases are at a disadvantage because they are schemabased, that is all data is stored in predefined table-spaces which are relatively hard to change. PMT, on the other hand, uses a  schema-less  xml4 database, that allowed the fully automatic indexing and retrieval of heterogeneous data sources as long as they were formatted as xml files [7 Within two months, a fully functional system prototype was created. PMT was used to 1 workforce data, from different center planning tools and from NASA  s accounting platform Business Warehouse \(SAP/BW 2 funded projects missions the agency  s work breakdown structure \(WBS 3  Financial Express Reports   which are large spreadsheet files with detailed plans versus actuals displays for any level in the WBS \(see Figure 6 4 other center systems The full system architecture is depicted in Figure 7 below  Figure 7  ABED System Architecture From a software engineering perspective the PMT team followed an approach known as  agile programming  8  4 xml stands for Extensible Markup Language 5 1 For this project, neither the time nor the organizational consensus was available to develop a comprehensive and complete requirements document \(some people argue that such documents are dysfunctional in any case refined and changed in close interaction with the customers \(OCFO the Mission Directorates and Space Centers. Data 


the Mission Directorates and Space Centers. Data input templates for the phasing plans, report formats and data exchange formats were iteratively refined as the customers had a chance to review and test working prototypes. Interactions between the development team and stakeholders occurred as needed, often on a daily basis. There was no formal decision mechanism  whatever could be solved on a  lower   level was just fine  with the one exception that any fundamental change in schedule or scope had to be approved by the agency CFO 2 provide an example, the PMT team collected 1,788 phasing plans from 10 different NASA Centers and Headquarters. The plans were received in four different data formats, and they were edited and refined over three rounds of submittals. Pretty much everything in this process was an up-to-last-minute change. As mentioned above, historically the NASA Centers used very different formats and concepts for their internal plans. As the OCFO strived for a unified standard, the different stakeholders pushed back multiple times requesting changes to this standard. The same thing happened with regard to the file exchange formats since the software teams at the individual Centers also had to respond to moving targets. In such a situation, frequent communication, software test runs, and flexible technology were crucial 3 Development and implementation of the various modules of the ABED were driven forward by the rapid release of fully functional prototypes. This rapidity allowed customers and other stakeholders to get a hands-on experience of the product early on More often than not, the requirements were refined after this first exposure. This refinement can be framed as a collective learning experience since both customers and developers developed insights that would have been impossible without a concrete product at hand. Ultimately, this hands-on approach led to a high confidence that the developed product would in fact be ready for operational use 4 In our experience, in situations of rapidly changing requirements, direct interactions among the individuals of the development team are more efficient and less error-prone than formal processes and tools \(such as bug-tracking tools consisted of three software developers, one management scientist, one accounting expert, and one customer service representative. This mix of expertise within a fairly small development team made it possible to react quickly to any stakeholder request whether it was technical or accounting-related in nature personal face-to-face communication 5. IMPROVEMENTS IN YEAR 2 The lessons-learned from fiscal year 2008 led to three main areas of potential improvements: increase in accuracy of plans, better communication, and capture of commitments as an early warning indicator As pointed out above the collection of unified phasing plans was highly successful in 2008. However, a detailed end-ofyear analysis revealed that the plan data for costs were overly optimistic. The cost plans predicted that 77% of funds would be costed by the end of the year when in fact only 71% were spent. Therefore, the OCFO decided to put special emphasis into encouraging the Centers and Mission Directorates to create performance-based plans rather than simply aligning the plans with average agency performance metrics To support this effort the OCFO created a series of 


To support this effort the OCFO created a series of measures 1 costing pattern for each funded project in 2008. This gave the resource analysts a baseline to work against 2  exception reports  These reports were used by the OCFO and the Mission Directorates to review the initial plan submissions. The exception reports highlighted any deltas between the 2008 spending pattern and the 2009 plans. In addition the reports also flagged any other errors and rule violations 3 to assist program offices and Centers in estimating the lead times for various types of procurements The second area of improvement was the communication between the functional organizations \(Centers product organizations \(Mission Directorates ownership of the final approved agency phasing plans. A highly interactive process with weekly teleconferences and three video-conferences, supported by enhanced phasing plan tools, was implemented to further open the missioncenter communication during the phasing plan development, review, and approval cycles 6 Finally, commitments \(see footnote 3  in addition to obligations and cost  were added to the set of performance indicators. Since the budget execution process starts with committing funds, the level of commitments could serve as an early warning indicator for obligations. In practice, the actual commitments of 2009 were compared to the historic spending pattern of 2008 6. DISCUSSION How many large-scale projects were canceled before their implementation even started? Project managers are only too familiar with the traditional model, which starts off with an extensive process of requirements collection. After years of producing large documents, the political situation has changed, the key executives have moved on and the project gets  re-scoped   If there was only one lesson learned for the development of management systems, then it is: define a clear goal and keep the requirements collection process as short as possible Start with the  low-hanging fruit  and use what is at hand and has proven its usefulness \(bricolage None of the other enablers was particularly new. However it was the consequent pursuit of a fast and results-oriented implementation that guided project management \(executive sponsor vs. expert facilitator stakeholder involvement, and a flexible software engineering approach \(agile programming Finally, a sustainable success can only be accomplished if the system actually gets used in  every-day  management decisions. In this case, the ABED became the single source of reference for a wide range of budget execution decisions within NASA REFERENCES 1] A.

the evaluation of the designed methodology according to the design research paradigm  4. Evaluation of RPBBs  The evaluation described in this paper focuses on RPBBs which are the results of applying the methodology \(not the designed artifact itself Findings about quality and applicability of RPBBs allow conclusions regarding the quality and applicability of the underlying methodology. In this contribution, a formal and a contentual evaluation are differentiated. While the formal part contains theoretical analyses of RPBBs regarding predefined requirements \(cp. Section 3.1 documents the practical \(content-related applicability of RPBBs  4.1. Formal Evaluation  As part of the research project, twelve workshops and several interviews in European municipalities have been conducted which involved domain experts and modeling specialists who had to benchmark each RPBB with regards to fulfillment of the defined design goals \(cp. section 3.1 completely fulfilled, +/- partially fulfilled, - not fulfilled  not evaluated yet municipalities provided process models that were used to identify process activities and to design the RPBB. However they were not involved in the design process thus ensuring validity of the evaluation results through separation of data used to develop the method from evaluation data. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, the requirement of a minimal number Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 of RPBBs is replaced by relevancy/necessity. If all RPBBs are considered relevant and necessary, the number of RPBBs can be assumed minimal. Three RPBBs have not been evaluated, as they have just been identified during the prior evaluation period Table 6 provides an overview of the results  Table 6: Evaluation of RPBBs Requirements No. of evaluated RPBBs    Modularity 24 10 0 3 Reusability 33 1 0 3 Comprehensibility 31 3 0 3 Unambiguity 20 14 0 3 Documentation 33 1 0 3 Relevancy/Necessity 27 7 0 3 Multilingualism 34 0 0 3 Level of Generality 33 1 0 3 Level of Detail 22 12 0 3  Altogether, the degree of accomplishment can be considered as high. There is no RPBB that does not meet the demands. However, deficiencies can be identified regarding modularity, unambiguity and level of detail. Examples for deficits concerning the level of detail are the RPBBs ?send? and ?archive Especially archiving can be understood as a modular activity or separate process fragment. Weaknesses regarding modularity and unambiguity are closely related to the demand that only minimal overlapping should occur. Although overlapping could not be prevented completely, the evaluators? feedback initiated extensive revisions on names, synonyms examples and explanations of RPBBs. A list of the most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These 


most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These RPBBs have to be carefully analyzed during further modeling activities in order to be improved or rejected  Table 7: List of most deficient RPBBs RPBB No. of Deficiencies Coordinate 10 Assign 3 Take from 3 Change/Update/Complete 3  Summarizing, suitability of RPBBs for distributed modeling of collaborative processes can be confirmed on the basis of the formal evaluation However, evaluation from a content-based perspective provides more experience-driven and thus, practice-related feedback 4.2. Contentual Evaluation  For contentual, practice-oriented evaluation, a number of 200 processes have been modeled with five municipalities that are involved in the project to prove practical applicability. Using a prototypical web-based tool implementation, the modeling was carried out in a distributed manner by public administration officials. The procedure for distributed collaborative modeling required each official to depict the present status of their process fragments as well as the information flow with other process participants \(whom themselves modeled their activities points out the basic principle of differentiating RPBBs and information objects is presented in Figure 3 using the Business Process Modeling Notation [30 This fragment depicts the involvement of another collaborating unit within a municipal approval process which the building authority is basically responsible for. This unit participates in the service production by providing a statement. Although specific attributes have been annotated for RPBBs and information objects, they are not visible in the presented view. Examples are the number of pages and medium of information objects as well as communication channel, number of copies, and template support \(cp. Table 5 Documenting 200 real processes of diverse public administrations proved to be very valuable because both, the various issues as well as the perceived advantages of the component-based modeling approach emerged. Most important advantages mentioned by evaluators from public administrations are the standardization and flexibility of process modeling \(consistent levels of detail and generality as well as terminological pre-definitions specifications that enable modeling also for inexperienced people, and the transparent modeling approach \(combination of RPBBs and information objects methodology meets the basic requirements for distributed modeling of collaborative processes discussed in Section 2.1 Perceived issues to be addressed are a lack of awareness about some self-evident activities uncertainties regarding overlapping \(which should have been eliminated to a large extent level of detail which causes relatively high modeling efforts. Issues and advantages have to be considered by further research as the discussed findings only represent perception in the public sector domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009

Summary and Outlook  This paper describes the development of a methodology for the domain-independent identification of Reference Process Building Blocks which can be used for distributed modeling in collaborative process environments. Based on an initial evaluation of adaptation mechanisms from the area of reference modeling, suitability of a compositional \(building block-based derived. This contribution describes both the construction as well as the evaluation of the methodology in the public sector where the identified RPBBs have been used exemplarily for modeling of about 200 municipal processes Summarizing, the RPBB-based modeling is considered to be suitable to model collaborative processes in a distributed way. A number of advantages can be exploited from the described component based modeling approach such as the reduction of model heterogeneity and the diffusion of a common understanding \(through standardization of terminology, level of detail and level of abstraction the distributed modeling of process fragments by responsible domain experts as well as the consistent consolidation of the process fragments to complete process models based on their standardized components The actual methodology for RPBB identification provides a valuable basis for targeted users \(cp Section 1 individual domains and purposes. Although this contribution is limited to an analysis of the suitability for the public sector domain, the specified RPBBs can be evaluated for the use in other industries that focus on information management and collaborative service production \(e.g. finance or insurance sectors as well However, the claimed generality of the actual methodology for domain-independent identification of RPBBs has not been proven yet. For that purpose current research is concentrating on applying the methodology to other industries. Due to the collaborative character of medical treatment processes and the highly specialized and distributed knowledge of involved actors, the health care domain was selected for a follow-up project. The expected findings will provide valuable information to improve the methodology described in this paper Further challenges and potential fields for research arose during the evaluation. First, guidance rules should be developed in order to implement capable plausibility and consistency checks not only from a syntactic but especially from a semantic point of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 view [31]. Additional evaluation of the methodology itself \(which is the actual artifact by using the methodology in other domains, in order to refine and complete the design activities. A potential disadvantage identified during evaluation is related to the high level of detail which has to be managed. Although the provided methodology is 


managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
