Abstract 
Having a secured internet transaction is a real big challenge in this new era of net-based social engineering hacking, impersonation and fraud. Hence, user authentication has become really important for all kinds of internet browsing transactions. This is especially true when we need to identify the exact users who have actually used the system, irrespective of the device address or location, from where the user committed internet access. The main aim of this paper will be to present a model for validating user-identity especially for internet browsing using browser software. This user validation will be carried over with respect to the ISPs which were used for service access. The main reason behind this spurred from 
the thought of different users using internet cafes, borrowed wireless modems or just temporary kiosks available in transport transit points like airports, restaurants and other public spots, anonymously and thus posing the danger of violating the security principle of non-repudiation. Another dangerous trend which is observed is the use of proxy programs, because of which any banned or blocked sites, can be accessed with ease. This all leads to the scenario where any unregistered user can visit, access and download any internet placed resources, for which de-centralized network infrastructures have no control of. In this paper, we are recommending a browser based user authentication scheme 
that can be combined with hashing and biometrics to properly validate a user so that he will be held liable for all actions committed by him in the cyber-world 
Keywords- Browser security; internet authentication browser based validation; user identification; non-repudiation internet transaction; secured internet sessions 
 
 INTRODUCTION User authentication refers to the process of validating the identity of a user. This would mean that the system has to identify the user and check against a stored database to see if the user is permitted to use the system. For that, various schemes have been identified including username/passwords, one-time passwords, KERBEROS 
I 
authentication, biometrics etc. that are having its own benefits and demerits.[10 Web browser is an application-software which is used to access the internet resources available in the internet. These information resources exist as files and grouped together under a domain name which can be identified as well as referred by using a Uniform Resource Identifier \(URI Browsers are primarily being used to access the World Wide Web contents and can be used to get access to intranet private networks too or network file systems based on protocols like FTP, Telnet etc. The major web browsers are Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, and 
Safari.[8 Users access internet using Internet service provider ISP\hich are usually huge organizations that can be public/private in ownership. They are having huge network infrastructure for forwarding data traffic to devices. They use channels laid across the region using copper-wires, optical fibers and also wireless medium. [1 T h e di ffe re nt  technologies that exist for user connection are also varied based on the transmitting speed and bandwidth. We have ISPs that can be grouped as Transit and Hosting ISPs based on the server space, and are leased. [2  User authentication for Internet access in ISP works as 
follows- Users can access internet using the different technologies available at his disposal as described above. For dial-up and DSL connections the user has to login using the user-name and password, where as for shared network, just plugging in the device using the cable is enough. Proxy setting using IP address and the port number may be necessary in a shared network setting, if that is not supplied by the DNS server running DHCP Wireless connections require the use of authentication too; WPA2 being the new encryption standard used, offering more security than WEP.[3  Web access security is of concern here as the basic security concepts critical to Internet information security are 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which is left as a future discussion topic as far as our paper is concerned. The concepts of authentication, authorization, and nonrepudiation are what are related to the people who are using that information, which is what this paper is all about. Out of that, non-repudiation is what is of concern to web authentication to make the users accountable for the actions that they do in the internet and also for the usage of accessed information at a later stage There are some studies conducted in the same line which are discussed in the next section of related works

M.Mallikarjuna, et.al discu s ses t h e tec hn iqu e o f  using a universal web authentication system by using a unique web identity. Here the gist is to use a Universal Web Id for net based authentication system. The system however doesnêt venture into maintaining their own database, which becomes a problem for tracking users accessing across diverse domains. Work of Yu Sheng and Zhu Lu s al s o  worth discussing here which envisages a scheme to combine the password entered by user, password associated with private key protected by truste d platform module and user certificate given by a trusted computing platform. Because of this, picking the password alone on the web will not have an effect on userês security  A study by Ayu Tiwari and Sudip Sanyal pos ed a  new protocol using multifactor authentication system that is both secure and highly usable, using Transaction Identification Code and SMS to give extra security level using username/password system. This approach requires an additional reliance on external SMS services that may hinder the performance of the system  The following principles which are of vital importance for any internet based transactions  cu s s e d h e re This principle refers to security features which will enable data transfer so that message is not altered in an unauthorized manner. This is called Data Integrity and can apply to items while in storage or process too. This principle is critical in financial and other sensitive digital transactions and storage Confidentiality essentially means secrecy and requires that the private information may not be leaked outside authorized entities. Data has to be kept secret in transit saving or processing. Research data, copyrighted materials insurance and other corporate records will come in this category Availability principle is required for prompt working of the system so that its service is not denied to valid users The main emphasis will be on authentication and authorization, which are discussed next Authentication will let the system identify who is who. It will let a user to validate themselves and then identify him This can be done using username/password technique\( what the user knows\ or by what the user carries, like his smartaccess card. It can be done by using personês identity too like using biometrics \(example:-fingerprint, eye-scan, voice recognition etc.\uthorization is another act which goes along with authentication and gives rights or privileges to authenticated users on the computer resources. [1   Non-repudiation, with reference to ISP authentication for internet browsing activities is related to an assurance for which the èdoer èor user is responsible. Non-repudiation is like a non-bail warrant because of which, the party in contract or communication cannot deny the actions because of the authenticity of their signature affixed while committing the action. This can be just an act of sending an email, browsing an internet resource or downloading/uploading file in the net. Repudiate or deny with respect to a digital action can be challenged by using a digital signing, biometrics or by digital certificates II P ROBLEM D EFINITION  There can be a situation where different users will use internet for downloading illegal stuff or use net resources for transactions against the law of the land. How is it possible to ever track these users and record the actions that they commit? What all evidences can be there for a forensic investigator so that it can be used effectively against them And lastly but not the least, how to employ non-repudiation principle effectively so that these perpetrators donêt escape the punishment they ought to receive The major hurdle is the de-centralized network infrastructures from where these types of illegal activities occur over which there is little monitoring or control. Also logging the user identity is also a big challenge, based on which only we can initiate legal actions. MAC address recording is a long soughed solution, along with tracing the IP address of the machine to which it is leased to by the ISP of. These can be easily circumvented by the use of MAC address altering software, which are so easy to achieve Again the use of proxy services, both online and application ones that can run from your PC will defeat all attempts to log IP address Use of unregulated internet cafes, borrowed wireless modems or ad-hoc temporary Wifi spots can all lead to situations where tracking of user authentication difficult Now the problem that is worrying for all forensic investigation is this scenario where any anonymous user can visit, access, download and transact these illegal digital contents with ease, leaving no trace and identity of the user III P ROPOSED S OLUTION  For achieving Non repudiation for digital transactions digital signatures can be used. This is more applicable for document or messages by which we can ensure that the signature will identify the people who send/typed it, and also, since a digital signature can only be created by one party, it will ensure that a person cannot later deny his actions Also as no security technology is perfect and fool-proof itês suggested that multiple approaches may be used. This will include capturing biometric information and other data about the sender or signer. This will make the whole process more difficult to repudiate and identify the user in the most precise manner

A Public User validation- Re gion or country specific B User validation using browser in the application level 
 
In our case, repudiation has to be applied to webbrowsing. This is more tricky compared to the earlier scenarios, viz., message/document sending or email transmission. Here sessions have to be identified for each user and then the system has to identify who the user is, the one doing internet browsing at that particular point of time Logging of this information needs to be done also in a perfect manner. This logging has to be centrally stored and administered so that it will be easy for any forensic investigator or legal agency to check the status of a valid browser at a particular session even in a remote manner Apart from that, this identity information system has to be fail-safe in case of a system failure. In the event of an illegal login attempt, the system has to have a fool-proof mechanism encompassing the biometric techniques to invalidate the session and prevent the users from logging in and using internet Just like getting a SIM card for mobile connections, there is the need to establish a centralized governmental agency to validate internet users. This is synonymous of getting a phone connection or gun license or liquor permit where the users have to furnish their details before hand. In this case users need to validate using their credentials and submit their biometric information in the central system. A trusted 3 rd  party can be used for this purpose, similar to certification authorities like verisign and thawte. This will be individualistic for a country or province where laws and cyber-acts need to be amended to achieve this. This will also help the state to fight cyber-crimes and apply penalties to those who are acting illegally in the cyber-world   Figure 1. User activities for receiving authentication rights Figure1 gives an idea about the intended internet user actions which are mandatory for enabling browsing rights. For using internet in a specific regional network provided by the ISP the end user has to first submit his credentials to the browsing authority \(BA\ who will check for credentials much similar to the way a Certification Authority do. This can be time consuming as the BA need to co-ordinate with other agencies like police and emigration departments to check the credentials. Here the user will be registering his biometric information also like iris-scan images or fingerprints. Once that is recorded, the customer has to wait for a period of time before he can start browsing. Mail will be send to the user at h is registered address which will contain his session user name and password, which has to be changed as per his convenience After the above said procedures are completed, the user can browse the internet provided by his subscribed Internet Service Provider. The purpose of non-repudiation is achieved thus, but it must be noted that non-repudiation is possible without identity information too as per [6  B u t th is  is not recommended as any authentication without using identity information can jeopardize the very intention of this scheme, that is, to give maximum level of personalization for all browsing session done by a party Once the user receives his username and password he can start using the browser for accessing the net. But here also there is a need for checking the user identity that will form the second level of surveillance. For achieving this, we need to change the basic working of the browser itself Currently all browsers will just start working and will fetch internet data once it detects a net connection directly or through proxy. This has to be changed. Our proposal is to change the application level code itself to include an authentication dialog box as soon as the browser is run, and thus prevents the users from directly accessing the internet data. This dialog box or authentication window will run on top of the browser window and on successful login only will the users be allowed to see the internet data Design of the authentication module in the browser will be country specific too and while installation or after setting up, the users \(or administrators preferably\ should be allowed to configure the browser to supply the server address that will be authenticating the users. Now if it is region-wise we can easily supply the local server address of Authentication Agency or Browsing Authority \(BA\ that will be handling the authentication by means of an ip-address or DNS name

 Figure 2. BA authentication steps for user session  As shown in Figure2, the credentials entered by the user in the form of username password, session key or biometric information will be sent to the BA and will be validated. If the credentials are matching, the user will be allowed to do internet browsing  IV C ONCLUSION  The proposed solution addresses the problem of identifying and enforcing non-repudiation for all internet transactions including just browsing. These mechanisms are justifiable and enforceable in regions where the infrastructure is ready for user registration and systems which can generate non-breakable random passwords for individual user sessions. This is having an additional overhead of setting up the centers in many places according to the density of population. Additionally it needs a radical change in all browser software s too which has to dealt in a more comprehensive way. This is because of the reason that even the availability of one browser not needing authentication in the market will jeopardize the whole mechanism. But the way to deal with these kinds of çnoauthentication-needed browsersé will be to block all requests in the ISP level itself by matching the browser meta information send along with all internet packet data. An additional hurdle will be to apply this in a network domain under a common management. Here the task of administrator to enable route forwarding of all traffic to ISP and the systems in the ISP for invoking additional session management by BA validation to authenticate the user is a huge challenge for future work. The need to enhance nonrepudiation by using timeout management of the session, on user inactivity has also to be studied  R EFERENCES   1

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subîows and can also handle short ows with efìcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subîows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large beneìts over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufìcient trafìc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple reìnement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modiìed to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satisìed 1 It doesnêt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satisìed it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafìc through this path for the particular destination preìx for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Butterîy 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellyìsh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafìc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellyìsh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subîows and modulating how much data is sent over different subîows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subîows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efìciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafìc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafìc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafìc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafìc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafìc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufìcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafìc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modiìcations We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafìc patterns and show that it signiìcantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subîows 69
