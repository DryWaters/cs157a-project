manufacturer value is 249 ns. Our measurements give two zones, depending on whether the local or remote memory are accessed. Indeed, the average access time in the interleaving zone is the average of combining accesses to the local or remote memory. Our outcomes gave an average value of 278,3 ns We can conclude that, when working with codes mapped to cores in a same cell \(especially for those who demand a high level of cache replacement allocated in the same cell  s memory. The access to remote memory becomes very costly, so if cores in both cells must be used, the allocation of the data in the interleaving memory makes sense V.

The chosen technique was IARD [12] \(Irregular Access Region Descriptor characterise irregular codes at run-time which exploits the properties found in the access patterns, expressing them with a structure that allows a strong reduction in storage requirements without loss of relevant information. The lowcost, compact characterisation of the subscript arrays can be used to perform an efficient parallelisation of a wide set of irregular codes In order to test the efficiency of this technique, two well known benchmarks \(Sparse matrix-Dense vector Product and Irregular Reduction parallelised using OpenMP. The pseudocodes are shown in Table III. In both cases, some selected sparse matrices stored in CSC format from the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection [13], which had previously been reordered using this technique, were used as an input. The key features of these matrices are shown in Table IV The compiler used for the experiments was Intel ifort 9.1.052. The baseline compile configuration used in all our tests involved the -O3 option and the interprocedural optimisation \(-ipo B. Influence of Bus Contention To study the influence of the bus contention several scenarios were tested. On the one hand, an intra-cell scenario where the data are allocated in a single cell  s memory and the cores involved belong to the same cell. On the other hand, an inter-cell scenario where the data are fetched from the other cell  s memory and there are cores involved from both cells. Before presenting the results, it is necessary to 


both cells. Before presenting the results, it is necessary to clarify the meaning of a so-called thread distribution. For example, a distribution 15-11-13-9 means that for a onethread execution, the thread will be allocated in Core 15. For Table IV SQUARED-MATRIX INPUT SET USED IN OUR TESTS.

In the cases where more cores are used and the distribution is not pointed out, it means that the order in which the remaining available cores are assigned is not relevant 1 library was used to allocate all data in the Cell 0 memory and only cores in this cell were used. Several scenarios were set up to study the effect of running the Irregular Reduction and SpMV benchmarks with different distributions, in order to quantify the effect of the bus sharing 15-11-13-9 vs 15-14-13-12: This scenario is focused on 2 and 4 cores. In both benchmarks the sparse matrix must be completely read, which is expected to cause some number of capacity and compulsory cache misses. Therefore, the bigger the matrix, the higher the traffic in the bus, so a performance decrease is expected for the biggest matrices when sharing the bus. At the sight of the results \(Table V a better behaviour of the distribution 15-11-13-9 can be appreciated \(differences over 6% are highlighted biggest matrices \(3dtube, nasasrb and s3dkq4m2 four-core case. Indeed, it was confirmed that the bigger the matrix, the higher the traffic in the bus and the higher the improvement when there are only two threads per bus \(15-11 and 13-9 15-14-1312 can be observed, the traffic is not high enough to be relevant It is noticeable that the most important improvements occur only in the SpMV benchmark, especially for four processors This behaviour happens because SpMV executes a loop which goes through five different arrays, whereas Irregular Reduction goes only through two. So in the former case the cache reuse is smaller than in the latter one. At any given moment, therefore, the SpMV benchmark generates more traffic in the bus than the Irregular Reduction one 15-11-13-9 vs 15-14-11-10: This scenario is focused on 4 cores. The outcomes in Table VI show that there are no noticeable differences between the case when the threads are 151 Table VI PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT \(% MFLOPS DISTRIBUTION 15-14-11-10 OVER 15-11-13-9 FOR Nc = 4 CORES DATA ARE ALLOCATED IN CELL 0 MEMORY Matrix Nc

We know that IARD has no dependencies among the cores involved. Since the outcomes show almost no differences between threads mapped to different cores in different sockets and threads sharing the same socket, we can confirm, then, the conclusion of Section IV-A, which stated that each core behaves as an independent processor regardless of the sockets they are placed in 2 fetching data from a memory module in other cell was studied. Moreover, a comparison was carried out between the automatic thread assignment the system does and our manual assignments. To do that, libnuma was used through its command line tool numactl, in order to allocate all the data in the cell we were working in \(memory 0 memory \(memory 1 memory 2 We intended to infer from these experiments whether the default system behaviour is reliable or, on the contrary another memory allocation policy should be used 15-11-13-9 vs system-assigned: We used the Perfmon2 library to check the system  s default policy to assign threads to cores. This scenario compares a manual allocation with the default one done by the system. We found out that the system assigns the threads without a defined policy changing it in every execution, although it strives to place the threads in separate cells as far as it is possible. Therefore after discarding outliers, we present a range of results inside the standard deviation instead of a single average value. The outcomes in Table VII show a dramatic improvement with our distribution, especially for the biggest matrices \(3dtube nasasrb and s3dkq4m2 cell scenario, there was no distribution that showed such a big difference in the performance, which indeed suggests that the system does not maximise locality Threads spread over both cells: Our second test intended to find out whether the system assignment spreads the threads over two cells, even if there are available cores in the same cell. So the automatic assignment was compared to a manual distribution where the number of involved threads is kept balanced between both cells. The threads were distributed to cores 15-7 for two threads, 15-7-11-3 for four and 15-7-11-3-13-5-9-1 for eight.

Influence of Cache Coherency Taking into account that this kind of irregular codes strives to maximise the thread locality, we do not expect to notice important performance decreases due to the cache coherency protocols when the input matrices are big enough, since they will be masked by the traffic in the bus. If the matrices fit in each core  s cache, all misses, except the capacity ones, will be solved by the snooping protocol inside the bus, faster than 152 asking the directory. However, this will not usually be the case in real applications, because this type of codes usually operates with matrices far bigger than the cache size VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented the results of several tests carried out to characterise FINISTERRAE, an SMP-NUMA machine, in order to study the suitability of applying strategies to parallelise irregular codes initially developed for SMP systems The main factors considered were the thread-to-core distribution and the memory allocation. Firstly, a benchmark was executed to test the performance influence of several cores when sharing a bus and allocating the data in local or remote memory. Secondly, another benchmark was used to evaluate the influence of the cache coherency between two cores when sharing data. Furthermore, another test evaluated the memory access latency depending on the memory module allocated \(local, remote or interleaving At the sight of the results, we can claim that, especially for applications which use the bus intensively, the effect of sharing a bus between two or more cores degrades the performance and should be avoided by spreading the threads among cores in different buses when possible. We must take into account, though, that the test to evaluate the local and remote memory access latencies yielded important differences between them. Therefore, in cases where the threads must be spread in two cells the best policy will be to analyse and split the data in both memory zones, maximising the locality or, when not possible, allocating the data in the interleaving zone Regarding the cache coherency, the effects in the performance are noticeable when dealing with small sizes of data which fit into caches. The more the memory size increases the less significant the effect is. Therefore, for small data sizes, it would be advisable to map the threads on cores in the same bus. For bigger data sizes, the effect of sharing a bus will be more important and it will mask the effect of cache coherency. A noteworthy fact is that every core in the same processor behaves as an independent processor, so we can consider two processors in a bus as four independent 


can consider two processors in a bus as four independent cores After the benchmarking stage, an actual strategy to parallelise irregular codes, successfully tested on SMP architectures, was ported to FINISTERRAE. A set of matrices was chosen and reordered with this strategy, being applied subsequently to the sparse matrix-vector product and the Irregular Reduction benchmarks. Since this code works with sparse data, the effects regarding bus sharing were not as noticeable as in the previous stage. However, it was possible to confirm the importance of spreading the threads among cores in different buses when dealing with big data sizes the behaviour of each core as an independent processor, and the fact that the coherency effects are masked by the bus sharing when increasing the data size As a future work, we intend to develop strategies to guide applications at run-time in the frame of our project, so the conclusions presented here will help to define a thread-tocore mapping and memory allocation policies ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the MCyT of Spain through the TIN2007-67537-C03-01 project and by the 2008/CE377 contract among HP, CESGA, UDC and USC REFERENCES 1] L.

also be used to define constraints for service selection At run-time, the workflow engine for XML nets interprets and evaluates Filter Schemas and transition inscriptions to filter and create Web service descriptions as XML documents. With process monitoring and administration tools which are usual components of workflow management systems, new criterions and constraints for WS discovery and selection can be incorporated at run-time by reconfiguring transition inscription statements and variable instantiations in Filter Schemas  Instantiating abstract WS transition Figure 4 shows a fragment of the abstract WSC process in Section 5.1 to demonstrate the ability of XML nets in WS discovery. To obtain transport information, Web services whose descriptions are stored in an unknown WSDL repository should be discovered The token count of the place representing the repository is supposed to be unlimited. The abstract transitions find transport info service? and ?get transport information? are used to bind and call Web services at runtime. The incoming arc of the transition ?find transport info service? is a reading connection \(represented by a dashed arc nipulative Filter Schema FS2 used to create Web service descriptions is assigned to the outgoing arc of this transition. FS1 and FS2 are both generated according to WSDL Schema  Adapting abstract WS transition at run-time Suppose that the transition ?get transport information? is used to acquire flight information. Variables in FS1 should be \(partly  3 http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#A4.1 4 http://uddi.org/schema/uddi_v3.xsd es supplying flight information. As shown in Figure 5a the variable of the attribute filter ?name? of the element filter ?service? is instantiated with a regular expression for filtering Web services whose name contains the string ?flight?. This regular expression, together with the Filter Schema, is parsed to XQuery/XPath statements in process simulation or execution. If we use a reconfiguration tool to modify the regular expression at run-time as shown for example in Figure 5b, the transition ?get transport information? can then be adapted to acquire other transport information, e.g., train information. After a suitable WSDL document has been found, FS2 is used to create a new WSDL document for the place ?WS description by cloning the discovered document. Figure 5c shows the diagram of FS2 containing the WSDL root element definitions? and an element placeholder, which is used because the internal structure and details of the document to be created are not of interest in the case of document duplication  QoS-aware WS selection XML nets can also be used to select desired Web services if service constraints like QoS or customized preferences are taken into consideration. As WSDL and OWL-S provide no or limited ways for describing Web service?s QoS, we use in this paper OWL-QoS 43], which complements OWL-S with an ontology to specify QoS metrics for Web services, to demonstrate the ability of XML nets for \(QoS-aware Naturally, other Web service ontologies \(e.g., MOQ 11 e.g., WSLA [18 can also be used for this purpose Figure 6 shows another XML net fragment for the acquisition of transport information by selecting OWL 


acquisition of transport information by selecting OWLQoS documents which describe quality of Web services from a repository that contains 3 OWL-QoS documents discovered previously. Similar to the example in Figure 2, the Filter Schema FS1 is used to read and select appropriate OWL-QoS documents, and the Filter Schema FS2 to create new OWL-QoS documents for the place ?OWL-QoS document?. As Filter Schema provides no means for formulating inequality operators like ?&gt;? and ?&lt;=?, which are usually used to express constraints with parameters whose quantitative values are limited to a certain interval, transition inscriptions Figure 4.

The Filter Schema FS1 should then be created as shown in Figure 7. The variable of the attribute filter ?rdf: resource? of the element filter ?owl: onProperty? is instantiated with a regular expression to filter OWL-QoS documents specifying the property ?costUSCent?. To ensure that the maximal cost of the Web service doesn?t exceed 100 US cent, the inscription of the transition ?select transport info service? should be formulated as owl:maxCardinality &lt;= 100?. In process simulation or execution, the inscription is parsed and integrated into XQuery statements using XPath inequality operators  6. Conclusions  In this paper we presented a WSC method based on XML nets, which inherit advantages of Petri nets such as formal semantics and graphical expression. XML nets have additional strengths in the description of process and data objects, and the exchange of XMLbased structured data. The advantage of using XML nets for WSC is that control flow modeling, data and data flow modeling, and WS discovery and selection can be realized using a uniform powerful modeling language. Some uncomplicated tasks, as illustrated before, can be fulfilled without developing or using additional software components or agents. Naturally XML nets can also be combined with other Web service techniques to fulfill more complicated and demanding tasks  7.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
