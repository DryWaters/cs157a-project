Application of Data Mining on the Design of Intrusion Detection System  CHANG Zhen-yun 1 DU Yan-fang 2  1.TIANJIN TIANSHI COLLEGE, Tianjin,wuqing,301700 2.TIANJIN TIANSHI COLLEGE, Tianjin,wuqing,301700  651412577@qq.com Abstract In order to decrease the number of misclassification of attacks, the application of data mining technology on the intrusion detection was studied in depth. Firstly, the study background was introduced, and then the basic theory of intrusion detection system was analyzed, and then the basic 
theory of data mining technology was discussed and the mode of data mining was established, and the algorithm  was designed, and finally the simulation analysis was carried out and the results showed that this method had a good precious Keywords-data mining; intrusion detection system simulation I   I NTRODUCTION  A lot of new intrusion detection systems served a signature-depended method that intrusions were figured out through assigning every input event that was different from the defined signatures in advance that model malicious 
activity. The merit of signature-based method was the real thing that they could figure out intrusions with an allowed correctness and they inclined to formed fewer alarms than their anomaly-depended cousins. The intrusion detection system was ready to supplement and simplicity to allocation particularly in a big production networks. Therefore many commercial systems and a lot of deployed installations applied signature-depended detection Computer security was a progressively critical problem principally in light of the striking improvement in the number of computers timelessly linked with the network 
Some relative scientists put forward a great deal of advanced methods about the intrusion detection of network. Research in the field concluded thinking coming from the bioinformatics. Simultaneously, a lot of applied research for the statistical detectors and theoretical probabilistic research was carried out by some scientists. Assessing intrusion detection systems was a hard work because of the following reasons [1   1\It was ambiguous to collect a lot of data with high quality for carrying out the estimate for hideaway and rivaling ideas 2\lthough the actual lively data was acquired, labeling 
network joints as normal or intrusions needs a lot of time for a large number of human experts 3\The steady change of the network traffic could not only depict the new kinds of intrusions but could also transfer the respects of the “normal” activity 4\When evaluating the characteristic of an intrusion detection system, it was important to valuate not only the velocity of the system, but also the number of mistake alarm as well as the capital of misclassification II  I NTRUSION D ETECTION S YSTEM  The aim of the intrusion detection was to measure the 
activity of the intrusion; it collected and analyzed several point information of the computer network or computer system, and checked whether the network or system existing the trace and activity that was against the security strategies The combination of software and hardware of intrusion detection was the intrusion detection system. The technology of intrusion technology could was divided into the following kinds: the detection based on main computer, the detection based on network, the detection based on inter-core, the detection based on application [2   T h e m ode l of in t r u s i o n  
detection system was showed in Figure 1  Figure 1 The model of intrusion detection system III  D ATA MINING TECHNOLOGY  1\The basic conception of the data mining Data mining was a procession of extracting inter unknown by people in advance, useful information and knowledge from the many, uncompleted, noise, ambiguous actual application data. The procession of data mining was made up of three main stages: data preparation, data mining results express and interpret. The main technology used by data mining was listed as follows: association rule classify 
rule, Collection analysis and series mode a\ssociation analysis Association rule was a technology that analyzed the associative relation among the data, and the relation of different characteristic of a record through mining the association rule of original data, and the depending relation among many characteristic that satisfied a certain support degree and confidence degree. In the network security system the correlation of different intrusion activity for invader was found out using the association analysis 1890 978-1-4577-0321-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


Form description of association rule was listed as follows      2 1 m I I I R  was defined as a group data set W was a group item set. Each item T of W was a group data item and the condition of R T  was satisfied. A data set item X and an item T was assumed to exist, if the condition of T X  was satisfied, and the item T  supported the data item set X  The association rule could be depicted as a data discovered rule, which was expressed as follows Y X  1 where X and Y were two group data items T X   T Y     Y X  Support degree and confidence degree of depicting association rule could be defined as follows sup      Y X P Y X port   2      X Y P Y X confidence   3 Support degree was a measurement of importance of association rule, because the rule with lower support degree may occasionally happen. Support degree had a characteristic of expectancy, which was used to find the association rule effectively. Confidence degree was a measurement of correctness of association rule,. For the given rule Y X  the reliability of Y existing in the item including X would increase when the confidence enhanced Confidence degree offered the evaluation of condition probability of Y when X was given [2   b Series analysis The aim of series analysis was to find out the longitudinal correlation of different data record. It was important to consider the frequency series mode of events during the process of intrusion detection model, the main reason was that sometime a series of events by intrusion activities including the single event that suit for the normal model, the intrusion activity could be confirmed through analyzing the relationship among a series of events. Therefore frequency series found out could make us know a lot of performance of relating system activity or client activity The objective of series analysis was to mine the large sequences from the event database, and satisfy the frequency series required by minimum support degree by client, and this series mode should be maximum series d\lassify analysis The aim of data classification was to extract the performance of data item in the database, and the classify model was produced, and this model could make data of database into one of given classification. In intrusion detection, the intrusion classify could be carried out according to all kinds of criteria, classify analysis detect the past intrusion activity, and the description of every kind of classify could be given according to the classificatory criteria IV  D ATA MINING MODEL  Let    t t y x X   N t   2  1  be a training sample of observations where t x is a l dimensional vector of attributes t y was the signal in a express method of m-dimensional vector with positive unites  1  0   t y  1 1   N i ti y  As a base, a reasonably economical technique named Leader Algorithm in this research was applied, and later was applied in application to the intrusion detection. The following below Algorithm 1 has two significant differences comparing with Leader Algorithm. Firstly, the Algorithm 1 uses flexible centroids \(instead of permanent leaders\which will be recomputed after any change of the corresponding cluster. Secondly, the Algorithm 1 will be used in application to the labeled data, and we would be interested to make clusters uniform in the terms of labels. Respectively we will apply special regularization R in \(1\d \(2\ which should be powerful enough so that clustering will be conducted inside particular subsets with the same labels  V  D ATA MINING ALGORITHM OF INTRUSION DETECTION  The objection f data mining association rules was to find out whole frequent temporal association rules from the large database. The aim of data mining association could be divided into the following stages: \(1\orm the whole frequent maximal temporal item set with their relative supports; \(2\derive the whole frequent temporal association rules that suit for min-configure from frequent item sets mentioned above. See that in a very short time these frequent item sets were acquired, accepting the continual spiritual association rules was direct. Consequently, the algorithm for data mining continual modes was discussed on heather jangle. The main question of data mining temporal association rules was that the exhibition time of the items in the transaction database were permitted to be not same as one anothe 1\cription of algorithm Firstly, a pricings database D was separated into n  separations depended on the exhibition time of items and PS i.e. progressive screen, was blank. Define 1 C as the set of ongoing applicant item sets formed by database D Four parameters, i.e p  q min_sup and min_leng, were considered as the input values into algorithm of . As stated above, the minimum support threshold needed was defined by min_sup. During the stage of temporal association rule forming, we use the parameter min_leng to be a purifying doorway for frequent item sets to fit for the minimal length needed for the exhibition time. The procession of algorithm was outlined as follows, where algorithm was divided into four sub-processions due to simple of description 2\The first sub-procedure of the new algorithm 1891 


Beginning time p was constant, last time was defined by q original Sub-procession: The database D was divided into m separations and s p was defined as   where 1    p q m   a   q p h h q p P d       where q p d  was divided into m separation b   s p Sub-procession one: Forms one item set with ongoing screen c\rom p h  to q this procedure was first scan for q p d   d\rom every one item set h q p P X   1 where leng p q min_    e\hen the condition of PS X  1 was satisfied, and the condition of   1 1 X N count X ph   was obtained f\hen the condition of   sup min_  1 h P count X  012 was satisfied, and the condition of h begin X   1 was obtained g\hen the condition of s p X  1 was satisfied, and the condition of 1 X p p s s  was obtained h\hen the condition of     sup min_    1 1    h start X m m P count X was satisfied, the following equation was established 1 X p p s s   end i\hoose 1 C from 1 X where ps X  1 and   ps  The second sub-procession: Form candidate k C item set with the computing crossing means a\ every item in 1 C  1 sup   p   True key       0   P  b\en 1 sup   p item the condition of false key item   was satisfied c\erwise True key item    d D item sup  item  key item  to 1 P  d  mod   1 e frequency P  for whole 1 P p  start e 1 sup _   p pred p   1 sup    015  p p key p  f\d   1  2    015   k P k for k  do start g   1    k k P gen trascal C If key C C C k      then for the whole separation beginning from p to q  Input the first sub-procession, where p s included supp for all modes that were critical modes h\or the whole p s item  when the condition of sup _ sup  pred item  was satisfied, and the item item P k    sup sup    item P k  i False key item P k    went back to k k P  j\erwise, when False key C C C k      and C item P k    k sup _ sup   pred item P k   False key item P k     l\t back to k k P end if m\t back to k P  The third sub-procession Input 1  k P the assignment of frequent \(K 1\odes p  with their support sup  p and the key p  signal Output k C the assignment of candidate k modes C  every with the signal key C  the result sup _  pred C  and sup  C when c was not a critical mode a\rom p P k 1   q P k 1  where 1 1   item q item p   2 2      k k item q item P  1 1      k k item q item p  for the whole k C C   do start c True key C      sup _  pred C  d\or the whole \(k 1\ub-sets S of C do start e 1   k P S  then, omitted C from k C  f\erwise start sup  sup _  min sup _  S pred C pred C   g\hen it was not key S  then False key C    h\d; if not key C  then sup _ Pr   ed C key C   i\d; went back to k C  VI  S IMULATION RESULTS  The original studying data was about four gigabytes of compressed binary TCP data from six weeks of network traffic. It was processed into about five million connection records. At the same time, the three weeks of detecting data was about three million joint records. The joint was a series of TCP packets beginning and ending at some good predefined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP \(Internet Protocol\address to a target IP address under some predefined protocol. Every joint was signal as either normal, or as an attack with completely one particular attack kind. Every joint record concluded 100 bytes or so  There were four kinds of attacks, which were listed as follows 1\: denial of service 2\: remote to local 3\t to root 1892

16 16 Mx M using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and signi\336cantly less than the number of messages transmitted when using the All-Node mechanism If we compare the performance of the sensor nodes that use the Schedule-Buffer and the FusedSchedule-Buffer mechanisms to the ones using the All-Nodes mechanism we can see that those sensor nodes using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism transmit only 43-47 of the messages transmitted by the All-Nodes mechanism The same node using the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism achieves an even more signi\336cant reduction since it only transmits between 35-45 of the total number of messages transmitted if it were to use the All-Node mechanism This reduction of the number of transmitted messages affects the energy consumption levels directly The energy consumption per node for the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism is less than the average energy consumption using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and signi\336cantly less than the energy used in the AllNode mechanism In the Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism each node reporting activities to the Sink requires between 42-50 of the energy exhausted by a sensor node using the Schedule-Buffer mechanism and between 30-32 of the energy exhausted by a node in the All-Node mechanism The reduction in the number of messages is explained by using the global schedule and the buffer mechanisms used by Schedule-Buffer scheme The Schedule-Buffer mechanism also outperforms the All-Nodes mechanism in terms of energy consumption reduction achieved during data preparation in this simulation the Schedule-Buffer mechanism uses 70-75 of the energy used by the All-Node mechanism VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a new data preparation mechanism named Fused-Schedule-Buffer mechanism to prepare the data needed for generating the TARs The proposed mechanism is able to reduce the number of messages that have to be sent to the Sink about the targets\325s activities by eliminating the redundancy resulted from having multi sensor nodes reporting the same event beside the proposed mechanism make sure that a sensor node will not send its data the data collected about the target\325s behavior if the target is not active enough Simulation results have shown that the FusedSchedule-Buffer mechanism outperforms the All-Nodes and Schedule-Buffer mechanism in terms of energy conservation An interesting application of TARs is predicting the location target of a missed reported event R EFERENCES  I Ak yildiz W  Su Y  Sankarasubramaniam and E Cayirci A s urv e y on sensor networks IEEE Communications

The proposed approach focuses on Mining Maximal Frequent Itemset Generation. In this paper, Array based approach and Effective Pruning Mechanism is used for generating Maximal frequent patterns There are two main ingredients to develop an efficient MFI algorithm. The first is the set of techniques used to reduce the size of search space, and the second is the representation used to perform fast frequency computations. This paper describes how proposed algorithm achieves the same  In general the structure of the transactional database may be in two different ways -Horizontal data format and Vertical data format. Here, we are using vertical data format for storing the transactions in the database. In vertical data format, the data is represented as item-tidset format, where item is the name of the item and tidset is the set of transaction identifiers containing the item Consider our example database which includes six different items, I = {A, B, C, D, E, F} and six transactions T= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The vertical data format of the database DB is given below Table 1 : Vertical Data format of the transactional database DB All Frequent items are extracted first. The support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidset of each item. Let us consider the minimum support to be 3 From the above structure, all items except F are frequent The items A, B, C, D and E are frequent items and will be considered to next level In the next level a dynamic array \(N intersecting the tidsets of every two frequent items. The constructed array \(N two frequent items. The size of the array will be n\(n+1 where n is the number of frequent items. Value of each and every cell in the array is initialized to zero. The value of cell N[i,j] is 1 if number of transaction occurred in the intersection of tidset of frequent item i and j satisfies the user specified minimum support. Otherwise the cell value is zero. Once the array is constructed successfully, all possible Maximal frequent itemsets\(PMFI from the array. The constructed array is given below N ABCD 


E D C B  Table 2: Dynamic array \(N frequent items The possible maximal frequent itemsets \(PMFI obtained from this array are considered to the next level All the other itemsets are pruned. The number of possible large itemsets is less than or equal to number of frequent itemsets. From this array, PMFIs are obtained in two ways. We can take all columns and first row. \(Columns A B, C, D and row E Rows E D, C, B and Column A One column entry or one row entry is a single PMFI. For example the itemset \(x,y,z itemset if and only if there is an entry 1 in both cells N[x,y] and N[x,z]. For example ADC is a PMFI because of the values of both cells N [A, D] and N [A, C] is 1 Once all PMFIs are retrieved from the array, they are arranged in descending order with respect to their size First column entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item A \(ADC the PMFI includes the frequent item B \(B entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item C CDE the frequent item D \(D PMFI that includes the frequent item E \(EC are arranged in descending order with respect to their size So the Itemsets in PMFI are ADC, CDE, EC, B, D The First itemset ADC has no superset in MFI and it is frequent. So ADC is a MFI\(with support count 3 added to MFI The Second itemset CDE has no superset in MFI and it is a infrequent item set. so all \(n-1 includes C CDE are generated. 2-itemsets of CDE are CD and CE.\(DE is not taken for test. It does not include the item C ignored. CE is frequent and it has no supersets in MFI. So it is added to MFI. CE is a MFI\(with support count 3 obtained from CDE 


The Third itemset EC is already included in MFI and it is ignored The Forth item B has no superset in MFI and it is a frequent item and it is added to MFI The Fifth item D has a superset in MFI and it is ignored From above example, MFIs with support count 3 are ADC, CE, B The process will be continued till testing all possible maximal frequent itemsets. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely The pseudo code for proposed algorithm is given below in figure 1  Item  Tidset A  T1, T2, T3, T4 B  T1, T4, T5 C  T1, T2, T3, T5, T6 D  T1, T2, T3 E  T2, T4, T5, T6 F  T6, T5    Pseudo code Find All MFI\(PMFIs,min_sup all Maximal Frequent Itemsets Inputs i Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets ii for mining process Interfacing Functions Output i Find All MFI\(PMFIs, min_sup For each x  PMFIs if x has a superset in MFI continue else if x is frequent MFI=MFI U x else Find MFI by obtaining Permutations\(x,min_sup For End return MFI

So, the time taken to compute MFI is negligible. As we are following vertical data format, support also need not be calculated separately In this case, support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidlist of each FI. The vertical representation has the following major advantages over the horizontal layout: Firstly, computing the support of itemsets is simpler and faster with the vertical layout since it involves only the intersections of tidsets. Secondly, with the vertical layout, there is an automatic reduction of the database before each scan in that only those itemsets that are relevant to the following scan of the mining process are accessed from disk Pruning The Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets\(Maximal 


Candidate Itemsets array. All Maximal frequent itemsets are obtained from only these PMFIs. Other itemsets are pruned automatically. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely. The proposed approach applies superset checking to eliminate the non maximal frequent itemsets. Once all PMFIs are generated, each PMFI is checked whether it is a subset of any maximal pattern. If so the itemset is eliminated entirely. Counting is not performed for this itemset and next PMFI is taken for test IV. RESULTS The testing of the proposed algorithm has been carried out on the real dataset \(containing long itemsets the number of candidate itemsets taken by the proposed algorithm to find MFIs and it is compared to Genmax algorithm for various values of minimum support. The support is varied from 75 to 95. The proposed algorithm had been compared with GenMax algorithm and results show the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets to find all MFIs Figure 2 illustrates that, the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets and produces all MFIs very quickly than GenMax algorithm. Support is taken as x axis and the number of candidate itemsets taken to find all MFI is taken as y axis For Mushroom, the improvement is best explained by how the MFI is computed at each level and found directly without waiting for FI completely. This leads to a much greater reduction in the overall search space, since the reductions is so great at highest levels  Figure 2. Number of Candidate itemsets taken by ABMFI and GenMax Algorithm from Mushroom dataset This approach will be working very efficiently for any sparse and dense dataset, when the size of maximal frequent itemsets is close to the number of frequent itemsets V.

experts can start their ore deposits estimations with much clearer data which is easier to deal with XII. CONCLUSION We have presented how data mining can be applied to the borehole data coming from active mine area. We are certain that data mining has a huge potential for other types of borehole data. One of the important steps in data mining is the preparation of data into useful form for various algorithms. Together with domain experts we have identified a way for transforming data to a form acceptable to k-NN classification and association rules mining algorithms Although we have shown how the k-NN classification and association rules mining techniques can be applied here this framework will open new possibilities to perform other data mining tasks to this type of data. Our experimental results are very promising in this regard as they show that we are not only able to match the accuracy of the results with IDW method used in the mining industry, but also exceed it \(93.1% accuracy was obtained by 3-NN method while IDW gave 88.5% accuracy rules as a separate analysis tool can improve not only k-NN classification results but also IDW interpolation results. This is particularly important for convincing mining companies 119 of the benefits of data mining, as with a little effort they can improve the method they are already using As we have shown in this paper, not only choosing right classification techniques can help us to improve interpolation, but more general analysis on data like association rules can contribute a lot. Thus, the more knowledge we have on the hidden relationships and patterns the more accurately you can construct an interpolation. Moreover, discovering hidden correlations not only important for this task, but also can contribute to understanding about complex geological processes that this specific area undergone. Therefore data mining, which can discover useful knowledge purely from data is of great importance and will be area of research for next generation of exploration and mining specialists Finally, we have proposed to use mathematical morphology for filtering the results of rock type interpolation. In the example given here, we have seen that it performed well in removing relatively small objects and filtering out large 


areas of interest from rock types XIII. FUTURE WORK This paper provides a framework for using data mining techniques on the borehole data. Using this framework we would like to investigate possibilities of using other classification techniques on this type of data. We mentioned that borehole data can contain more information about the area besides spatial coordinates, rock types and metal grades so classification that utilizes this extra information will be on our immediate research agenda Application of mathematical morphology provides possibilities for further research on domaining \(filtering out large areas of interest be given also to this ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I want to thank the Director of the WH Bryan Mining and Geology Research Centre, at the University of Queensland Professor Alan Bye and his PhD student Mr Younes Fadakar Alghalandis for contributing their expertise to this research This work is supported by the AuScope National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy by the Australian Commonwealth, the Queensland State Government and The University of Queensland REFERENCES 1] A.
