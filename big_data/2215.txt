INTRODUCTION \nAlloyed melts of group IV and/or group V elements with \nthose of group VI \(chalcogens S, Se, and Te the so called chalcogenide glasses \(ChG since their first uses [1] several decades ago. One \nof the most exciting new applications of ChG for nmicroelectronics is the recently introduced nano-ionic \nmemristive nonvolatile memory device – the Conductive nBridge Random Access Memory \(CBRAM PMC developed at ASU [2, 3]. CBRAM operation is \ncharacterized by fast switching, information being stored not \nas a charge but as nanoscopic amounts of metal in the \nelectrolyte, high scalability, and reliability. The storage \nmedium can be placed in the interconnect layers above the \nsilicon circuitry in a back-end-of-line BEOL resistive memory operate \nby controlling the growth and dissolution of metallic \nfilaments within the glass film. The steps involved in \nfilament growth are illustrated in Figure. 1 [4]. \n \nFigure 1 – Mechanisms of conductive-bridge formation \nin ChG-resistive memory [4]. \nUpon the application of bias, above a specific write \nthreshold, ions sourced from an active electrode \(Ag  ChG film. The \n  2 \nkey mechanisms identified in this forming stage [6] are:  1 auto-ionization [7] of Ag into Ag+ ions \nat the active metal/ChG interface; 2 of Ag+ ions through the ChG solid state \nelectrolyte; and 3 initially at the inert electrode and subsequently along a \nneutralized Ag branch. Over time, the combination of these \nprocesses result in the formation of a conductive metallic \nfilament \(or collection of filaments within the ChG layer, \nwhich significantly reduce the resistance across the \nstructure. The lowered resistance is still maintained after the \nbias is removed. The filament growth process is reversible. \nUpon the application of an opposite bias below a threshold, \nthe filament is dissolved, thus resetting the film to its high \nresistance state. This type of voltage controlled, \nelectrochemical resistive switching is the key operating \nprinciple of most memristor devices.  \n While silver-based ChG resistive memory technologies \nhave matured extensively in recent years, significant \nchallenges remain to improve repeatability in cell function nand cycling endurance, as well as to facilitate their practical \nuse in analog and digital applications. The 


central problem \nis the large variability, even within the same device, of \noperational parameters and programmed resistance. To \nunderstand variabilities we need to understand the physics \nof conducting filament formation and dissolution. Recently, \nMonte Carlo \(MC the kinetics of Ag transport and \nmetallic filament formation in resistive memory engineered \nwith chalcogenide films [5, 6]. However, MC simulation by \nitself does not support the development of compact models \nfor ChG-based resistive memory that can be used in circuit \ndesign. Compact models require a reduced set of closed \nform analytical functions best derived from the standard \ndifferential equations in device physics, e.g., continuity, \ndrift-diffusion, and Poisson. Physics-based finite element \n\(FE serves as an essential bridge between \nfirst principles calculations and compact model abstractions. \nIn this paper the mechanisms of Ag transport and reactions \nin ChG materials are modeled using FE simulation. The nresults reveal that the processes of field-induced Ag+ ion \ntransport and the electro-deposition of Ag via reduction at \nwithin the ChG film can be modeled effectively with \nstandard drift-diffusion \(flux-based solvers that simulate \nthe transport and reactions of ionic species in solid state \nmaterials. \n2. BACKGROUND n Glassy electrolytes are of particular interest in solid state \nionics as they can contain a wide variety of routes for ion \ntransport and this, in conjunction with the low activation \nenergy in certain materials, leads to high ion conductivity \n[8]. Much of the prior work in materials has concentrated on \nimproving our understanding of the nature of thin film \nglassy electrolytes and in the nano-morphology of high \nmobility ternary materials in particular. These ternaries can \nbe formed by combining a base glass, such as Ge-Se and nGe-S \(both typically chalcogen-rich structural \nflexibility that provides nano-voids through which the ions \ncan readily move from one equilibrium position to another. \nThe existence of such an open structure in both cases not \nonly aids with the introduction of the metal by diffusion \nduring electrolyte formation and facilitates subsequent ion ntransport, but also allows the formation of electrodeposits \nwithin the material which is critical to compact nano-device \noperation. In addition, Ag-doped germanium chalcogenides \npossess particularly long anion-cation bonds with a \ncorrespondingly low electrostatic energy. These factors lead \nto a room temperature ion mobility which can exceed 10\n-3\n \ncm\n2\n/Vs. \n The conductivity of the ternary glasses is a strong \nfunction of the mobile ion concentration but above a few \natomic percent, both conductivity and activation energy \nchange more rapidly as a function of ion concentration \n\(saturating at 10\n-2\n S cm\n-1\n and 0.2 eV respectively in Ag-Ge-\nSe  unique phase-separated \nnanostructure. This is due to a metal-chalcogen reaction, \nwhich essentially nucleates on the chalcogen-rich regions \nwithin the base glass to form crystalline regions, typically \nless than 10 nm in diameter. These nano-crystallites are ion-\nrich Ag2S\(e e Ge-rich glassy dielectric [10-13]. The nano-\ninhomogeneous ternary is ideal for resistance change \ndevices, as the relatively high resistivity leads to an un-\nprogrammed resistance in excess of 1 G  in sub-micron \ndevices but the availability of mobile ions via the dispersed \nmetal-rich phases means that the effective ion mobility is \nhigh. \n In order to move mass, it is obvious that an ion current \nmust be generated and this requires a device with an \noxidizable anode \(e.g.., Ag, Cu e.g. \nW, Al, Ni electrochemically inert cathode, the \nelectrodeposition process is reversible by switching the \npolarity of the applied bias. When the electrodeposit is made \npositive with respect to the original oxidizable electrode it \nbecomes the new anode and dissolves via oxidation. It is \nimportant to note that it is the asymmetry of the device \nstructure that allows the deposition/dissolution process to be \ncycled repeatedly. Figure 2 shows a transmission electron \nmicrograph cross-section of the memory array, integrated \ninto the BEOL stack, and a detail view of a single storage \ncell [14]. \n \nFigure 2 – Transmission electron micrograph cross-\nsection of the memory array and detail view of a single \nstorage cell [14]. \n  3 \n The characteristics of two terminal ChG-based resistive \nmemory depend on the basic principles of electrochemistry \nand the unique characteristics of solid state ion conductors \nat the nanoscale. Electrochemical reactions are those where \nthe oxidation and reduction components of a chemical \nreaction are segregated by an ionic conductor within the \nreaction environment. In order to maintain charge balance, \nthe surfaces at which electrochemical processes occur must ntherefore be electron \(or hole two metal \nelectrode embodiment, electrons are extracted from one \nelectrode \(the Ag anode oxidation of a \nspecies in the environment \(Ag?Ag++e Ag\n+\n closed when the electrons \nare pumped into the other electrode \(the cathode the same or another cation species \n\(Ag\n+\n+e\n-?Ag redistribution of mass – material is removed from one \nlocation and electrodeposited at another using an 


applied \nelectrochemical potential as the driving force. This \nelectrodeposited material can have a profound effect on the \nelectrical characteristics of the area on/in which it is formed.  \nIn particular, low resistivity metal electrodeposits which \nbridge a high resistivity electrolyte can be used to control \nthe electrical resistance between the electrodes, thereby \nleading to resistance change memory or memristors. \n Typical device operation is shown in Figure 3 which \ngives a resistance-voltage plot for a 240 nm diameter nAg/Ag-Ge-S/W device with a 60 nm thick electrolyte [15]. \nAt 0.45 V, the intrinsic \(quasi-DC for this \nmaterial combination, the device switches from an off-state \nresistance, Roff, above 10\n11\n  to an on-state resistance, Ron = \n22 k , for a 10 A programming current. Once \nelectrodeposition is initiated, the threshold for further \nelectrodeposition is decreased, as indicated by the presence \nof a lower voltage \(0.22 V voltage divided by the current limit; this \nis explained by the fact that as long as sufficient potential ndifference is maintained for the situation where \nelectrodeposition is already underway, the reduction of nsilver ions will continue and the decrease in the resistance of \nthe conducting bridge will be maintained even after it has \nformed. If the external current source is limited, once the \nresistance falls to a point where the voltage drop is no \nlonger sufficient to support electrodeposition, the resistance \nlowering process ceases. The device transitions to a high \nresistance state at -0.25 V and this is due to the initial \nbreaking of the electrodeposited pathway by the reverse \ncurrent flow. Continuing the negative sweep, the off nresistance remains above 10\n11\n  as the voltage is swept out \nto -1.0 V with a leakage current of less than 10 pA at \nmaximum reverse bias. ChG memristors have been shown \nto switch in 20 ns [16] and since the electrodeposit is \nessentially metal that has been added to a chemically \nsaturated electrolyte, it is extremely stable with a \ndemonstrated off/on margin of several orders of magnitude \nbeing maintained even after 10 years at 70 C [17]. \nEndurance \(cycling electrolyte devices have been taken beyond \n10\n11\n write-erase cycles, with projected endurance to more \nthan 10\n12\n cycles [18].  \n \nFigure 3 – Resistance–voltage plot of a 240 nm Ag-Ge-S \ndevice using a 10 A current limit \(arrows show sweep \ndirection  I-V nhysteresis response of ChG resistive memory. These data \nwere obtained from measurements on a Ge30Se70 PMC cells \nwith cross-sectional areas of 25 m\n2\n. It can be observed that \nthe cell switches from a low current high resistance low resistance from active to inert electrode to specified compliance limits. If the bias from \nactive to inert electrode is swept down from 1V to -1V a nswitch from high to low current state occurs at \napproximately -60mV. \n \nFigure 4 – Current voltage characteristic of a 25 m2 \nPMC made with a 60 nm thin film of Ge30Se70 ChG. \n While the oxidation, transport and reduction of metal \nprovide a qualitative explanation for the electrical response \nof ChG resistive memory, a model of these processes based \non quantitative solutions obtained through finite element \nnumerical simulation has not been reported.

FIRST PRINCIPLES PARAMETERIZATION \n Finite element simulation affords an opportunity to tie \ndirectly to first principles, atomistic calculations. Many of \nthe device parameters used in the FE equations can be \napproximated by these calculations. These parameters \ninclude material bandgaps, band offsets, dielectric \nconstants, effective carrier mobilities, defect levels ndiffusion constants for Ag and other extrinsic species, and \nenergies required for chemical reactions Density functional \ntheory \(DFT  calculations using either local density \napproximation \(LDA  GGA 21]. \nBandgap and Band Offset Calculations \n It is well known the DFT, in either the LDA, of GGA napproximations, grossly underestimates bandgaps in \ninsulators and semiconductors [22, 23]. In the case of ngermanium-selenium glass compounds, we show, in Table I \na comparison between GGA and experiment for two nstoichiometries. The GW method [24] has had consistently \ngreater success across a wide range of materials nTable I \nCalculated and Experimental Bandgap \n GeSe2 Ge2Se3 \nGGA 1.26 eV 1.42 eV \nExp. 2.7 eV 2.0 eV \nDefect 


Level Calculations \n Defects level give the Fermi level at which the occupation \nof a defect changes. In a glass, this is actually a distribution, \noften assumed to be Gaussian. The position of an electrical \nlevel can be crucial to both transport properties and defect \nchemistry. In the case of Ge2Se3, our DFT calculations npredict that the interstitial silver, AgI is always positively \ncharge, i.e., auto-ionized [25]. To be clear even in the \nneutral and -1 charge state, AgI loses one electron, because \nthe highest energy atomic valence state is above the \nconduction band edge for Ge2Se3. One would expect that the \nexcess electron simply drops to the bottom of the \nconduction band. However, we have found that electrons \nactually self-trap, and prefer to do so in pairs [26]. The \npair’s self-trapping is accompanied by Ge-Se bond scission. \nThis self-trapping persists in the presence of interstitial \nAg—the self-trapping site can be distant from the ion. So, \neven in the presence of compensating electrons, interstitial \ntransport is always ionic and the formation of a conductive \npathway requires recombination with an electron.  \nDiffusitivity \n In the finite element code diffusivity is approximated as \n , \(2 frequency, and EA is the activation energy for \nhopping. We obtain EA directly from atomistic calculations nusing the nudged elastic band method [27]. This is a robust, \nalthough approximate, technique that yields a complete \nreaction path, along with the activation energy. Care is \nrequired to search in many directions because there are \nmany local saddle points, some with very high barriers. Our \npreliminary exploration of the interstitial Ag\n+\n ion, in a \ncrystalline model of Ge2Se3, shown in Figure 5, indicates \nthat within the layer activation energies are high, > 2.5 eV, \nreflecting the stiffness of the network, while transport along \nthe layer surfaces has a much lower activation energy ~ 0.5 \neV. One very interesting result is that the activation energy \nfor hopping is very sensitive to the assumed charge state. In \nfact, the activation for intra-layer transport is lowered by at \nleast 1 eV in the -1 charge state. This is consistent with the \ndamage associated with electron self-trapping.  \n \nFigure 5 – Crystalline model of Ge2Se3 \n The attempt-to-escape frequency, taken from \nvibrational calculations is ~5x10\n-11\n sec\n-1\n. The hopping \ndistance, a, is ~7 Taken together, these predict a \ndiffusivity of ~1.0x10\n-11\n cm\n2\n/sec at room temperature. \nThis is higher than Tafen et al. predicted in GeSe3 [28].  \n \nChemical Reactions: Thermodynamics and kinetics \n Chemical reactions are driven by the energy of \nreaction, which determines equilibrium concentrations of \nreactants and products, and the activation energy, which \ndrives the kinetics. One important result of the DFT \nstudies, is that the knock-on reaction, wherein silver \n  5 \npushes a germanium atom into an interstitial site, has a nvery low energy of reaction, ~0.1 eV. Other reactions \ndeserve further study. \nDielectric Constant Calculations \n The dielectric constant is potentially crucial to \nunderstanding the frequency-dependent impedance \nmeasurements. In a simple picture, the capacitance of a ChG \nresistive memory device depends on an effective film \nthickness, assuming that the dielectric constant does not \nvary with silver content. However the dielectric function \ndepends inversely on excitation energies, so that the \nsmallest allowed excitations typically near the bandgap, \ngive the largest contributions. The degree to which silver \nperturbs the bandgap or to which silver leads to defect \nlevels in the gap, can alter the dielectric constant. These \neffects are available to atomistic calculations, and will refine \nour modeling considerably. \n4. FINITE ELEMENT MODEL IMPLEMENTATION \nDescription \n Finite element simulations are performed with Silvaco’s \nnumerical simulator ATLAS on a two-dimensional structure \nrepresentative of a vertical ChG resistive memory cell. This \nsimple structure, shown in Figure 6, is composed of a ChG \nfilm \(~ 50 nm thick electrodes. For the simulations, the ChG film is \nmodeled as a wide bandgap semiconductor. Material \nconstants used for the film and electrodes, reported in Table \nII, were extracted either from data reported in [29] or nobtained from DFT calculations discussed in the previous \nsection. \n \nFigure 6 –Two dimensional FE simulation structure. \n \nTable II \nMaterial Constants \nChG bandgap 2.5 eV \nChG dielectric constant 5.0 \nChG affinity 3.45 eV \nAnode workfunction 4.6 eV \nCathode workfunction 4.2 eV \n \n The ATLAS FE code solves standard carrier statistics and \ntransport equations for semiconductors and, simultaneously, \nperforms ion transport and reaction calculations on the \nstructure.

Figure 7 \nplots the initial distribution of Ag+ ions \(along the cutline nindicated on Figure 6 that the ions \naccumulate near the active electrode in the un-biased \nstructure due to built-in fields set by the electrode \nworkfunction differences. \n  6 \n \nFigure 7 –Initial distribution of Ag+ ion prior to device nbiasing. \n Transient bias response simulations are performed by \nincreasing the voltage on the anode in 100 mV increments \nup to 0.9V while the cathode is fixed at 0V. The bias is held \nat each increment for 10 s Figure 8 plots the Ag+ ion \nconcentration at biases of 0V, 0.2V, 0.4V, 0.6V, and 0.8V, \nalong the cutline in Figure 6. The figure shows that the ions \ndrift away from the anode with increasing bias and begin to naccumulate at the cathode interface between 0.2 and 0.4V. \nAdditional simulations ramping down the voltage to 0V \nshow that the ions return to their equilibrium distribution \nwithin 100 s. It should be noted that the transport times are \nhighly dependent on the diffusion constants in equations \(6-\n8 principles calculations as well as \nparametric extraction from experimental data may lead to \nadjustments to these diffusivity values. Moreover, research \nis ongoing to determine the extent to which dispersive ntransport may play a role in the movement of Ag+ ions in \nthe ChG film. \n \nFigure 8 – Evolution of Ag+ ion distribution with \nincreasing bias on the anode. Cathode is fixed at 0V. \n Figure 9 plots the evolution of the neutral Ag \nconcentration as the bias on the anode is increased \(along \nthe same cutline significant rise in the \nconcentration of silver within in the film and evidence of \nspecies accumulation i.e., electro-deposition demonstrates that FE simulations which include \nparticle \(ionic and neutral species ncan simulate the growth of a metallic bridge in ChG film \nwhen a positive bias from anode to cathode is applied. \nFurthermore, when the anode voltage is reduced back to 0V, \nthe neutral Ag concentration remains fixed at its high level, \nwhich indicates that the resistance of the film has been \nswitched to a fixed low state. \n \nFigure 9 – Evolution of neutral Ag distribution in ChG \nfilm with increasing bias on the anode Cathode is fixed \nat 0V. \n In order to model resistive switching, the FE code has \nbeen modified to convert the neutral Ag species to an n-type \ndopant. While this may not be an accurate description of the \nprecise nature of neutral Ag in the film, the conversion does \neffectively reduce the resistance across the film as the bias \nis increased. Figure 10 plots the simulated resistance vs. the \nanode voltage during programming The figure shows that \nthe resistance before bias is greater than 1 G  and upon the \napplication of bias up to 0.4 V the resistance exhibits an \nexponential decrease. Above 0.4V, the change in resistance \nbecomes linear reaching ~300 k  at 0.9V. Further \nsimulations reveal that this low resistance level is \nmaintained when the anode bias is returned to 0V. \n \nFigure 10 – Simulated film resistance vs. anode bias. \n The I-V response of the structure shows that the FE \nsimulations model the hysteresis characteristics of resistive \n  7 \nmemory Figure 11 plots the anode current vs. voltage as the \npotential on the anode increased from 0V to 0.9V and then \nreturned of 0V.

SUMMARY  \n The results of finite element simulations that incorporate \nthe processes of particle movement and reactions in \nconjunction with standard carrier statistics and transport \nequations are shown to effectively model the resistive \nswitching behavior of ChG-based resistive memory. The \nsimulations are performed on virtual two-dimensional \nstructures representative of the existing CBRAM technology \nbased on ASU’s ChG PMC platform. Key parameters for \nthe system of equations solved by the Silvaco’s device \nsimulator ATLAS are obtained from first principles DFT ncalculations or, where possible, extracted from experimental \ndata. The FE simulation models the growth of neutral Ag \nwithin the ChG film under applied bias. The simulations \nalso reveal that the neutral Ag density is left unchanged \nonce the bias is removed. While work is ongoing to improve \nthe accuracy of the simulations through adjustments to the \nsimulation parameters and additions to the equation set, the \nresults reported here provide strong qualitative evidence that \nfinite element codes can simulate ionic transport and \nmetallic growth in ChG-based resistive memory. \nQuantitative comparisons to experimental data will be \nprovided in the

Table III shows the conversion time and running\ntime of METIS. The conversion time of DBLP is about 7.5\nhours even though it has the smallest number of triples. It\ntook about 35 hours to convert the Freebase to a METIS\ninput ?le. We believe that this is because there are much more\nvertices which are connected to a huge number of vertices on\nFreebase and DBLP as shown in Fig. 4\(e existing\ngraph partitioning tools require similar input formats, this\nresult indicates that the graph partitioning-based distribution\ntechnique may be infeasible for some RDF datasets.\nTABLE III: Graph partitioning time \(sec 27218 130\nFreebase 91826 2610\nDBpedia 3055 504\nFig. 6 shows, for different building blocks, the ratio of the\ntotal number of triples of all generated partitions to that of\nthe original RDF data. A large ratio means that many triples\nare replicated across the cluster of machines through the data\npartitioning. Partitions using the 1-hop extended out-vertex or\nin-vertex blocks have 1 as the ratio because each triple is\nassigned to only one partition based on its subject or object\nrespectively. As we mentioned above, the results show that\nthe graph partitioning-based distribution technique can reduce\nthe number of replicated triples considerably, compared to the\nhashing-based technique. This is because the graph partitioner\ngenerates components in which close vertices, which have\nhigh probability to share some triples in their extended vertex\nblocks, are assigned to the same component. Especially, there\nare only a few replicated triples for the 2-hop extended out-\nvertex blocks. However, for the other extended vertex blocks,\nthe reduction is not so signi?cant if we consider the overhead\nof the graph partitioning-based distribution technique.\nD. Query Processing\nTo evaluate query processing performance on the generated\npartitions, we choose different queries from one benchmark\ndataset \(LUBM2000 DBpedia a set of benchmark queries,\nwe select three among them. Note that Q11 and Q13 are\nslightly changed because our focus is not RDF reasoning.\nWe create three queries for DBpedia because there is no\nrepresentative benchmark queries.\nFig. 7 shows the query processing time of the queries for\nTABLE IV: Queries\nLUBM Q11: SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x <subOrganizationOf> ?y .\n?y <subOrganizationOf> <http://www.University0.edu>}\nLUBM Q13: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <GraduateStudent> .\n?x <undergraduateDegreeFrom> <http://www.University0.edu> }\nLUBM Q14: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <UndergraduateStudent>}\nDBpedia Q1: SELECT ?subject ?similar WHERE n<Barack Obama> <subject> ?subject. ?similar <subject> ?subject. }\nDBpedia Q2: SELECT ?person WHERE { ?person rdf:type> <Person>}\nDBpedia Q3: SELECT ?suc2 ?suc1 ?person WHERE {\n?suc2 <successor> ?suc1 . ?suc1 successor> ?person}\ndifferent building blocks and different distribution techniques.\nAll building blocks ensure intra-VM processing for LUBM\nQ14 and DBpedia Q2 because they are simple retrieval queries\nhaving only one triple pattern. For LUBM Q13, random, 1-in\nand 2-in needs inter-VM processing using Hadoop because\nQ13 is a star query and so all triples sharing the same\nsubject should be located in the same partition for intra-VM\nprocessing. On the other hand, for DBpedia Q1 which is a\nreverse star query where all triple patterns share the same\nobject, random, 1-out and 2-out needs inter-VM processing.\nFor LUBM Q11 and DBpedia Q3 where the object of one\ntriple pattern is linked to the subject of the other triple pattern,\ninter-VM processing is required for random, 1-out and 1-\nin. The results clearly show that using inter-VM processing\nis slower than using intra-VM processing because of the\ncommunication cost across the cluster of machines to join\nintermediate results generated from subqueries. Furthermore,\neach Hadoop job usually has about 10 seconds of initialization\noverhead regardless of its input data size. In terms of the intra-\nVM processing, the difference between the hashing-based\nand the graph partitioning-based distribution techniques is not\nsigni?cant for most cases even though they have different\nbalance and replication levels as shown in Table I and Fig. 6.\nWe think that this is because each partition is ef?ciently stored\nand indexed in the RDF-speci?c storage system, thus such\nlevel of difference on the balance and replication does not\nhave a great effect on query processing. The only notable\ndifference is when we use 2-out for partitioning because\nthe graph partitioning-based technique reduces the number of\nreplicated triples considerably. Especially, on DBpedia where\n2-out using the hashing-based distribution technique generates\nmany replicated triples, 2-out using the 


graph partitioning-\nbased distribution technique is three times faster than that\nusing the hashing-based technique for DBpedia Q3.\nIn summary, we conclude that the most important factor of\nRDF data partitioning is to ensure the intra-VM processing\n333\n01\n2\n3\n4\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(a 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(b 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(c DBLP\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(d Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(e Replication\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ13\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph y\n P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(a LUBM2000\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ1\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(b Time \(sec or most slower than intra-\nVM processing.

However, for all the\nother cases, the hashing-based distribution technique is a better\ndistribution method if we consider the huge overhead of the\ngraph partitioning-based technique. Also it should be noted\nthat running existing graph partitioner can be infeasible for\nsome RDF datasets due to their complex structure.\nV. RELATED WORK\nGraph partitioning has been extensively studied in several\ncommunities for several decades [13], [15]. Recently a number\nof techniques have been proposed to process RDF queries on\na cluster of machines. Most of them utilize existing distributed\n?le systems such as HDFS to store and distribute RDF data.\nSHARD [19] directly stores RDF triples in HDFS as ?at text\n?les and runs one Hadoop job for each clause \(triple pattern  store\nRDF triples and, given a query, iteratively evaluates each triple\npattern of the query on the two tables to generate ?nal results.\nBecause they use general distributed ?le systems which are not\noptimized for RDF data, their query processing is much less\nef?cient than the state-of-the-art RDF storage and indexing\ntechnology [18]. [14] generates partitions using existing graph\npartitioning algorithms and stores them on RDF-3X. As we\nreported in Sec. IV, running an existing graph partitioner for\nlarge RDF data has a huge amount of overhead and is not\nfeasible for some real RDF datasets.\nIn addition, two recent papers [17], [16 have proposed\ntwo different approaches to general processing of big graph\ndata. [17] promotes to store a vertex and all its outgoing\nedges together and implemented a distributed system to show\nthe parallel processing opportunity of their approach. [16]\nproposes to store a vertex and all its incoming edges together\nand shows that this can speed up some graph processing on a\nsingle server, such as PageRank. In comparison, [17] presents\na system built using out-vertex block for both subject and\nobject vertices, whereas 16] presents a single server solution\nusing the in-vertex block for both subject and object vertices.\nBoth are special cases of our SPA partitioner. We argue that\nour SPA framework presents a systematic approach to graph\npartitioning and is more general and easily con?gurable with\ncustomizable performance guarantee.\nVI CONCLUSION\nWe have presented SPA, an ef?cient and customizable\nRDF data partitioning model for distributed processing of\nbig RDF graph data in the Cloud. The main contribution is\nto develop a selection of scalable techniques to distribute the\npartition blocks across a cluster of compute nodes in a manner\nthat minimizes inter-node communication cost by localizing\nmost of the queries on distributed partitions. We show that\nthe SPA approach is not only ef?cient for partitioning and\ndistributing big RDF datasets of diverse sizes and structures\nbut also effective for processing RDF queries of different\ntypes and complexity.\nAcknowledgment This work is partially sponsored by grants\nfrom NSF CISE NetSE program, SaTC program, and Intel\nISTC on Cloud Computing.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “About FacetedDBLP,” http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.\n[2] “BTC 2012 Dataset http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.\n[3] “DBpedia 3.8 Downloads http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads38.\n[4] “METIS,” http://www.cs.umn.edu/˜metis.\n[5] “Opening up Government http://data.gov.uk/sparql.\n[6] “Resource Description Framework \(RDF  Data-gov Wiki,” http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki.\n[8] “UK Legislation http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats/rdf.\n[9] S.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
