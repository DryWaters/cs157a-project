Adaptation of the Morris Method to Multi-Dimensional Factors for Air-Launch-to-Orbit Separation Henri Sohier CNES/Onera Toulouse FRANCE henri.sohier@onera.fr Jean-Loup Farges Onera Toulouse FRANCE Helene Piet-Lahanier Onera Palaiseau FRANCE Abstract\227 This work is part of a technical study of the French space agency CNES Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales and the French aerospace laboratory Onera for the development of an air-launch-to-orbit system This system based on a dedicated aircraft and a space rocket aims at offering more 003exible dates and trajectories to micro-satellite launching missions The separation phase between the carrier and the launcher requires deeper insight as it involves various dynamics and brutal changes of the system's parameters The risk of collision is studied via the evolution of the minimum distance between the aircraft and the launcher after the release A complete 3D simulation is developed with the system's data to reproduce various problems faced in the history of store separation such as aerodynamic interactions mechanical malfunction mass repartition wind turbulence improper ejection forces or design uncertainties The geometric constraints of the aircraft and rocket are set with limited planes and solids of revolution to allow effective calculations and representative results The result of the collision study depends on a large number of uncertainty factors representing the variability of the launcher's and carrier's characteristics In order to evaluate the relative in\003uence of these uncertainties a sensitivity analysis is performed Because of the large number of factors the classic Sobol's method cannot be directly used as it would require too much calculation The Morris method can ef\002ciently reduce the number of factors by factors 002xing but it is normally limited to scalar factors and the separation simulation includes a multi-dimensional factor for the wind turbulences Different studies especially in Geographic Information System showed the interest and the dif\002culty to use the Morris method with multi-dimensional factors but the problems raised have never been identi\002ed One of the problems highlighted in this work is the variability of the Morris method's results due to the arbitrary choice of the samples used for the multi-dimensional factors A separation simulation shows that the results are not only variable for the multi-dimensional factor for the wind but also for classic scalar factors interacting with it in particular in aerodynamics Because of the lack of repetitiveness 20 of the applications of the Morris method on a separation simulation do not provide correct factors in\003uences an aspect never discussed The adaptation presented in this paper reduces the variability of the results by averaging the calculations and checking both the histogram and the correlation of the samples The adapted Morris method followed by the Sobol's method ef\002ciently identify the main factors affecting the variability of the collision results It is shown that the main factors of the separation are the interaction on the launcher and aircraft the wind turbulence the release mechanism and the relative position of the launcher and aircraft Finally two new methods dedicated to multi-dimensional factors representing time or space variations such as the factor for the wind are developed one to include the amplitude uncertainty and one to easily estimate the most important part of the time or space variation It is shown that the in\003uence of the beginning of the wind on the collision results is low in spite of its effect on the aircraft's trajectory but that the in\003uence of its end is high because of its effect on the launcher

                       14 1 I NTRODUCTION The French space agency CNES and the French aerospace laboratory Onera are developing a future air-launch-to-orbit system to launch space rockets from an aircraft rather than from a land-based spaceport Figure 1 shows a demonstrator of this system named Eole and part of the program Perseus The in\003uence of the different factors which may affect the separation of the aircraft and launcher is of particular interest Indeed the separation includes an important number of dynamics some complex dynamics such as the aerodynamic interactions are approximated the parameters are subject to uncertainties the important mass and inertia variations at the separation must be considered with particular attention and such a space program requires safety and accuracy The in\003uence of the different factors is estimed by sensitivity analysis It can in particular help to specify the aspects of the dynamics which will be taken into account for the development of robust controllers The numerous studies of store separation are of great interest for this study of air-launch-to-orbit separation However sensitivity analysis is rare in store separation Some studies 1 


of store separation focus on speci\002c dynamics like aerodynamics and use in this case Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD or wind tunnels 2 Others aim on the contrary at de\002ning a general probability of failure without specifying the role of each dynamic a typical approach in risk analysis   The literature related to store separation problems is used to develop a complete simulation The aerodynamic interactions are often considered as a major source of risk because of the dif\002culty to predict them They are generally de\002ned as constant forces Pre vious studies of store separation showed that they should be considered up to a distance of four times the launcher's diameter The ejection forces are also identi\002ed as a possible source of risk in other programs The y ha v e been recommended for this project and are often used in store separation 4][8 The wind turbulence are generally simulated with the Dryden model Finally  a missile separation studied at Onera shows the possible in\003uence of a lack of symmetry of the missile mass repartition The past studies are also used to choose the geometrical representation of the aircraft and the launcher The aircraft is sometimes represented with static unlimited planes in order to obtain analytical results for the minimum distance between the aircraft and the launcher However static planes do not take into account the aircraft's motion and unlimited planes may not correctly represent the constraints of the separation area Thus an alternative representation is chosen in Section 3 Many studies are also bounded to three degrees of freedom with a motion considered as included in a symmetry plane However the motion is typically not included in a symmetry plane in case of interactions or misalignment problems 6 Thus a six degree of freedom simulation is used in this study The Sobol's method and the Morris method 12 can be used to analyze the in\003uence of several factors on the result of a simulation The Sobol's method gives quantitative results but requires very large computational resources while the Morris method gives qualitative results but is much faster The Morris method is often applied 002rst to reduce the number of factors However it was developed for scalar factors and certain dynamics such as the wind turbulence of the store separation can only be represented with a multi-dimensional factor The limits of the Morris method appearing for multidimensional factors are regularly faced in Geographic Information Systems GIS 14 15 GIS purpose is to numerically study geographical problems like 003ood control or cities organization and a typical GIS multi-dimensional factor is a 2D map Thus a multi-dimensional factor can be a progressive space variation like in the case of a map or a progressive time variation like in the case of the white noise used to simulated wind Crosetto and Tarantolla approach the problem of the Morris method with multi-dimensional factors in 2001 by comparing samples and zeros but do not clearly de\002ne the raised issues at this time The y conclude in 2002 that using multi-dimensional factors with the Morris method is 224the most dif\002cult aspect of the entire procedure\224  In 2010 Saint-Geours and Lib urne try a similar approach and compare pairs of samples with a high number of trajectories which is however not linked to the multidimensional aspect of the factors While these studies use random realizations of the multi-dimensional factors the in\003uence of a group of scalar factors can also be studied by applying a variation 001 to each scalar factor This method is less adapted to time and space variations than random realizations However it is used to take into the amplitude of the time and space variations in Section 4 The next section is a summary of the Sobol's and Morris methods It shows why the multi-dimensional factors are only a problem for the Morris method The third section quickly presents the store separation simulation developed for this paper The fourth section presents different problems raised by the multi-dimensional factors in the Morris method and develops solutions These aspects are then tested in particular with the store separation simulation in the 002fth section before the 002nal conclusion 2 M ETHODS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Let f be a function

Y j Z i  001 and V  V  Y   E represents the expected value and V the variance S i is called a 002rst order index because it shows the in\003uence of a unique factor Z i  Other indexes can be

represents the in\003uence of the factor X i alone as well as its in\003uence when interacting with other factors The conditional variance V i can be developed V i  U i 000 f 2 0 where f 0 is the

Figure 4  Interpretation of the standard deviation very different that is when the effect of the factor is nonlinear or when there is an interaction with another factor Figure 4 illustrates typical cases The average of the absolute values 026 003 can also be considered instead of 026 to avoid any cancellation effect This paper uses the couple  026 003  033   The Morris method requires n  P  1  200 simulations with n  4 trajectories n is generally chosen less than 10   It is equi v alent to 50 minutes of calculation for a simulation solved in 15 seconds Limits of the Morris method The Morris method was originally developed for scalar factors and could not directly be used for multi-dimensional factors The only way to directly apply the Morris method would be to consider all the P t  p  P q i 1 r i scalar factors independently It is not feasible for two reasons First the large number of factors would require too much calculation For example as the white noise of the store separation has 1803 components the P t  1803  49  1852 factors would require n 003  P t  1  7412 simulations Second only the individual in\003uence of each component would be assessed while the global in\003uence of the multi-dimensional factor would remain unknown It would be likely to observe extremely low in\003uences for the components even if the multi-dimensional factor is very important The Morris method has to be adapted in order to handle a multi-dimensional factor like a scalar factor or in a similar way The objective is to limit the number of samples used and obtain a global in\003uence An important aspect of the new procedure developed in this paper is the representativity of the samples used If the 1803 components of the multidimensional factor of the store separation were each discretized in 4 values there would be 4 1803 different possible realizations a number too large to be computed with Matlab However only a few are to be used Furthermore in the original Morris method the representativity of the discrete values of each scalar factor can be guaranteed by choosing them equally spaced in the quantiles space If like in the previous studies the multi-dimensional samples are not checked a lack of representativity can lead to misleading results Figure 5  Model of the geometrical constraints Figure 6  Parameters for the calculation of the minimum distance 3 S IMULATION OF THE STORE SEPARATION De\002nition of the function This work focuses on the minimum distance between the aircraft and the launcher This important aspect has to be studied in order to avoid any collision The separation could also be studied with functions such as the separation time the distance covered by the launcher next to the aircraft or the turbulence of the aircraft on the launcher After the separation the trajectory could also be studied with functions such as the position of the center of mass the attitude the speed or the maximum acceleration The aircraft is represented with three limited planes and the launcher with a headed cylinder This representation is more accurate than the unlimited static planes used in the past and it also takes into account the motion of the aircraft With this general representation the calculation of the minimum distance at every time step of every trajectory is fast and it does not require accurate 3D models which are not available at this stage of the project Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the video obtained with the simulation developed The minimum distance between the launcher and each of the three planes is calculated separately and the minimum of these three values is the minimum distance between the launcher and the aircraft If the closest point of a limited plane is a point of its face and not a point of one of its edges the calculation of the minimum distance is the same as for unlimited planes If not the minimum distances between the launcher and each of the edges are calculated Figure 6 shows an example of such a calculation The relative position of the launcher and aircraft de\002ned by  OG   x G  y G  z G  t    and 022  as well as the characteristic lengths  L 1  L 2  L 0  and L 00  are known 4

Figure 8  Figure 9  White noise and corresponding wind be the white noise vector for the x-axis x 2 the white noise vector for the y-axis and x 3 the white noise vector for the z-axis Each of these vectors has one component per time step and each of these components can be considered as a scalar factor Thus the white noise vector x 1 is de\002ned as a set f x 1 1  x 1 2   x 1 r 1 g of scalar factors with r 1  601  Similarly x 2 and x 3 are two other sets of r 2  r 3  601 scalar factors Given the similarities between the vectors x 1  x 2 and x 3  they will be handled with a generic symbol x r  where r is a reminder of their dimension r  r 1  r 2  r 3  Figure 9 shows an example of realization of x r as well as the corresponding wind on the z axis The procedure developed in this paper is presented for a single multi-dimensional factor corresponding to a set of scalar factors but it simply has to be repeated several times in the case of a set of several multidimensional factors 4 A DAPTATION OF THE M ORRIS METHOD Doubled calculations In the classic application of the Morris method the discrete values have two characteristics 1 They are clearly de\002ned and would not change if the Morris method was applied again 2 They are representative in the sense that they fairly cover the domain of the factors distribution The samples used for multi-dimensional factors respect none of these two characteristics They are random and cannot be considered a priori as representative This important difference has not been discussed yet It results in a variability of the function output y and as a consequence in a variability of the elementary effects An elementary effect depends on the two values chosen for the factor considered but also on the values chosen for the other factors in case of interactions Thus all the elementary effects not only the elementary effect of the multidimensional factor can be random To limit the variability of the results more samples have to be used The variability of the results can also be estimated by using the same trajectories a second time with different multi-dimensional samples The variability 017 i associated to a factor i corresponds to the relative change of the average 026 i when different multidimensional samples are used 017 i  2 026 2 i 000 026 1 i 026 1 i  026 2 i 18 This estimator of the variability is reported on the results of this study in particular on the 002gures as a percentage If there is only one multi-dimensional factor a large percentage reveals that the choice of the samples for the multi-dimensional factor is important If the large percentage is obtained for one of the classic scalar factors it can be concluded that there is an important interaction between the multi-dimensional factor and this scalar factor If all the percentages have the same sign and about the same values the two applications of the Morris method gave proportional results with similar factors orders and the 002nal result can be considered as reliable If the percentages have large values with different signs and if the points are relatively close to each other the 002nal result must be considered with more care The de\002nition of a group of important factors is in this case very sensitive Calculating 017 i for each factor provides interesting results but it requires two times more estimations of the function It is also possible to only calculate the 017 i of the multi-dimensional factors and check that they are suf\002ciently low This only requires n  q  1 estimations of the function Pairs of samples It can also be an advantage to use two random realizations for each trajectory and not one random realization and zeros like it has been done before Indeed 1 If Y is a random variable the distribution of 001 Y often has a peak of probability about its average even when Y does not  Y uniform is a clear example 2 As more realizations are used the coverage of the function is improved 3 The in\003uence of the randomness of the vector's components and the in\003uence of their amplitude can be distinguished This separation is important even if the 002nal result is desired under the form of a global in\003uence of the noise including its amplitude as shown in the following subsection called 224Global in\003uence including amplitude\224 Indeed the amplitude can in this case be properly screened with representative values instead of zero and its maximum Veri\002cation of the histogram An expected or theoretical histogram is de\002ned as the product of the density probability function d.p.f by the number of components Samples with histograms close to the expected histogram represent an average population with a higher probability to be drawn The larger the number of components of a noise vector is the more the histograms and the expected histogram look alike However they may be very different for vectors of small and moderate size often used in simulation For example Figure 10 shows the histograms of two different realizations of a 101-component Gaussian vector generated with Matlab The histograms are very different from each other and very different from the expected one even though 101 could be considered as a large number In 002gure 10 the realization on the left has more values in  000 2 000  and the distribution on the right has more values in  000 1  Using these histograms would not be a problem in a Monte-Carlo experiment involving a very large number of realizations However the purpose of the Morris method is to obtain a few representative outputs Using as

Figure 10  Histograms of two different realizations input an average population with a higher probability to be drawn can help Two solutions have been considered 1 The 002rst solution is the use of a prede\002ned set of values respecting the expected histogram This set can 002rst be rearranged in a determinist way to respect given equations For example the factor is typically a white noise and its auto-correlation should be zero for any lag However these equations can generally only be minimized The set of values can also be randomly rearranged In this case the veri\002cation of the auto-correlation equations can for example be replaced by the veri\002cation of the Ljung-Box test very effective Both of these cases based on a prede\002ned set of value appeared to be very sensitive to the choice of the values and are likely to lead to misleading results 2 The second solution is to keep on using traditional tools to generate random realizations and check if they are close enough to the expected histogram Additional characteristics are also veri\002ed a posteriori  for example with a Ljung-Box test Arbitrary limits have to be de\002ned for the histogram For example the histogram of a 101-component Gaussian vector is divided into 21 bars and an acceptable range 006 001 acc is de\002ned for each bar 001 acc is chosen such that it is half of the bar's population but has to be greater than 1 and smaller than 2  This example is shown in Figure 11 The generation of a realization respecting this range takes in average 1  3 seconds with Matlab on the computer used for this work This processing time is the time spent to 002rst generate an average of 40000 realizations which do not respect this range Of course more restrictive acceptable ranges require more time Distance between the realizations The distance 001 between two samples has to be de\002ned Not only is it important for the calculation of the elementary effects 001 f  001  but it also raises the question of the difference between two realizations The Morris method may for example not be effective if the samples were too close as they would not be representative of the whole population of possible samples While the quantiles space is often used to de\002ne the distance between scalar factors it cannot be used with multi-dimensional factors Indeed Figure 11  Acceptable range for 101 components a series of multi-dimensional factors cannot be ordered and associated to a c.d.f Furthermore as the components of the multi-dimensional factors studied are generated independently the probability associated to the realization of a multidimensional factor is the product of the probabilities associated to each of its components Given that the histograms of the realizations are similar the probabilities associated to the realizations are also similar Let x r be a vector de\002ned as a centered multi-dimensional factor and let x r 1 and x r 2 be two realizations It is natural to de\002ne the distance between these two realizations as their correlation or as a norm of the difference x r 2 000 x r 1  The correlation is directly linked to the Euclidean norm of x r 2 000 x r 1  jj x r 2 000 x r 1 jj  v u u t r X i 1  x r 2 i 000 x r 1 i  2  q r  033 2 1   033 2 2 000 2 033 12  19 where  033 2 1 and  033 2 2 are the typical estimators for the variance of x r 1 and x r 2  and  033 12 is a typical estimator for the covariance between these two realizations Thus the correlation and the Euclidean norm are directly linked as the Bravais-Pearson linear correlation coef\002cient r p is de\002ned by 033 12   033 1 033 2   The Euclidean norm of jj x n 2 000 x n 1 jj is interesting as its distribution can easily be de\002ned If each component x r 1 i and x r 2 i follows a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation 033  each term x r 2 i 000 x r 1 i follows a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation p 2 033  By using a new random variable y r i such that p 2 033y r i  x r 2 i 000 x r 1 i  the Euclidean norm can be written p 2 033 p P r i 1  y i  2 where p P r i 1  y i  2 follows a khi-1 distribution with p n degrees of freedom Figure 12 shows the normalized cumulative histogram obtained for 2000 norms jj x r 2 000 x r 1 jj generated with Matlab and the theoretical c.d.f of the corresponding khi-1 distribution The standard deviation 033 is 1 and the number of degrees of freedom is r  101  7 


Figure 12  Distance between realizations As expected the c.d.f and the normalized cumulative histogram match While 101 can appear as a quite large number of components the distance between two realizations can vary a lot The relative width of the range including most of the values is equal to 51  If the histogram has been veri\002ed in particular with the third method the variances  033 2 1 and  033 2 2 are close to their expected value In this case the variations of the distance are due to the correlation between the two realizations If the correlation is large and positive the realizations are similar and the distance is low If the correlation is large and negative the realizations are similar but with opposite signs and the distance is large An arbitrary limit is de\002ned for the correlation and a new realization is generated until the limit is respected An average of 4 realizations has to be generated to obtain a second realization with a correlation below 0  025  Without this veri\002cation the correlation between two realizations with a veri\002ed histogram is frequently greater than 0  1  To build a trajectory the discrete values of each factor should normally be represented on axes Let f x r 1  x r 2  x r 3  x r 4 g be four multi-dimensional realizations whose histograms and correlations have been veri\002ed These realizations share the same properties and are separated by the same distance Thus they could be represented as an equilateral pyramid as shown in Figure 13 Morris normally recommends Delta  0  5 which is not the distance between two following discrete values Thus 001 loses its meaning in the case of an equilateral pyramid The main bene\002t is the possibility to use any sample for each trajectory It is suggested to use a new pair of multi-dimensional samples for each trajectory instead of the classic system of pairs based on m realizations developped for the scalar factors It increases the number of samples used and helps to obtain more general results The normalized distance 001 used for multi-dimensional factors must be de\002ned arbitrary as it has a different nature than those de\002ned in the quantiles space for scalar factors Using 001  0  5 would increase the elementary effect compared to the other factors while 001  0  5 would decrease it For a scalar factor following a uniform distribution 001  0  5 covers half of the domain Thus the variations 001 are important for both the scalar factors and the multi-dimensional factors whose properties have been veri\002ed an a unique value equal to 0  5 is used It can also be considered that in spite of the veri\002cations the distance between two samples is still random An average 001  0  5 is then also justi\002ed Figure 13  Representation of the multi-dimensional samples Actual population of samples If the r components of a multi-dimensional factor were considered independently n  r  1 samples would be used Indeed on each trajectory each variation of one of the components provides a new sample If the multi-directional factor is considered as a whole the Morris method requires only 2 samples per trajectory or a total of 2 n samples If the r components are all discretized in four values 4 r different samples can be generated The representativity of the 2 n samples should be justi\002ed The multi-dimensional factors are often time vectors or space arrays The time or space components can be converted in frequency components with classical tools such as the Fourier transform It can often be shown that ranges of frequencies only have a limited in\003uence on the dynamics First the time and space components are often 002ltered for example with low-pass 002lters attenuating frequencies above a cutoff frequency Furthermore the very low frequencies result in very small variations of the signal during the experiment time and only have a limited in\003uence on the dynamics By neglecting the corresponding frequency components the dimension of the multi-dimensional factor can be considerably reduced A smaller dimension means a smaller population of possible samples and a better representativity of the 2 n samples used with the Morris method Global in\003uence including amplitude A factor corresponding to the amplitude is generally de\002ned in addition to the multi-dimensional factor corresponding to the samples These two factors assess two different aspects of the in\003uence of a vector or array The factor corresponding to the samples can be seen as the in\003uence of the order of the values A unique factor can be de\002ned in order to estimate a global in\003uence and save calculations Low results obtained for the two distinct factors can hide a large global in\003uence Classic scalar discrete values are de\002ned for the amplitude One realization of the multi-dimensional factor can then be associated to each of these discrete values but more realizations can be used by generating a new pair for each trajectory Each trajectory includes a variation of the amplitude which is used as a switch for the samples The input variation 001 of the global factor has to be de\002ned In  the 001 used for the elementary effect of a group of scalar factors is the 001 applied to each different scalar factor In a similar approach Delta is considered to be equal to 0  5 for the global in\003uence of a multi-dimensional factor and its scalar amplitude 8 


Figure 14  Divergent trajectory for the in\003uence of a subpart Subparts in\003uence An easy and useful method to assess the relative in\003uence of subparts of the multi-dimensional factor is de\002ned This method can be used in the case of the store separation to know if a variation of the wind at the beginning is more important than a variation at the end The wind affects the aircraft which may be more sensitive to a variation at the beginning as it in\003uences the rest of the dynamics or to a variation at the end as it may not be controlled fast enough The wind also affects the 002nal fall of the launcher which is not controlled The estimation of the subparts in\003uence starts after a complete application of the Morris method Figure 14 shows a classic trajectory where the displacement A-B is used to calculate the elementary effect of a multi-dimensional factor x r  x i is another factor To assess the in\003uence of the beginning of x r  a divergent trajectory is de\002ned from point A This divergent trajectory follows a new dimension and stops at point B The factors values at B are identical to those in A except the beginning of x r which is identical to the beginning of x r in B Another divergent trajectory is de\002ned from A in order to assess the relative in\003uence of the end of x r  Smaller and smaller fractions can then be tested Thus the divergent trajectories are very 003exible The calculations required remain limited If the number of subparts analyzed is included in the number of factors P  the number of calculation keeps its simple form n  P  1  The in\003uence of any new subpart can be estimated with only n new calculations 5 T EST APPLICATIONS Doubled calculations A simple function f is 002rst used to compute statistics Let f be a function with a Gaussian vector x r following N 0  033  as a multi-dimensional factor f  x r   x r k 20 where k 2 N is a given index Thus f is a Gaussian variable with a standard deviation 033  and 001 f is a Gaussian variable with a standard deviation p 2 033  The absolute value j 001 f j vert follows a half-normal distribution The distribution of an average of four j 001 f j vert is called 224Not repeated\224 in Figure 15 It is suggested to repeat the calculations of the Morris method a second or even a third time in order to average its results The corresponding curves are called 224Repeated x2\224 and 224Reapeated x3\224 A factor 1  001 simply has to be applied to the x axis to obtain the actual results of the Morris method Figure 15  Distribution of the Morris method's results when the calculations are repeated Table 1  Sobol's total order indexes for the simpli\002ed simulation 1 Interaction/Y 0.549 2 Interaction/Center 0.490 3 Noise 0.214 4 Mass/Launcher 0.054 5 Interaction/Z 0.010 6 Interaction/X 0.010 7 Mass/Aircraft 0.009 Figure 15 shows the width of the second and third quartiles or in other terms the values for which the c.d.f belongs to 0  25 0    This width is considerably reduced and the values obtained are more localized when the Morris method is repeated several times This example function may seem particular but the results are representative of other cases For example if the function is an integration over multiple components of a Gaussian vector it can be assimilated as a sum whose output is also Gaussian Another test for the doubled calculations is carried out with a simpli\002ed simulation of the store separation based on P  7 factors q  1 multi-dimensional factor of the noise and p  6 scalar factors The other 42 factors are set to their average value Because of the important interactions between the factors the total indexes appear as the most representative results Table 1 shows that three factors are more important the effects of the interactions on the y axis aerodynamic forces their effects on the center of pressure and the noise The Morris method has been applied 20 times on the same 4 trajectories de\002ned after a discretization of each factor in 8 values n  P  1  32 simulations have been necessary A new pair of noise sample has been used for each computation of a trajectory Figure 16 shows all the results The three factors which appeared as important with the Sobol's method also stand out with the Morris method On the contrary the 20 points of each of the four other factors appear as compact groups close to the origin The points for 224Interaction/Y\224 and 224Interaction/Center\224 are scattered as much as the points for the noise Given that all the points are based on the same trajectories and thus on the same values of 224Interaction/Y\224 and 224Interaction/Center\224 it reveals a high interaction between these factors and the noise Although 224Interaction/Y\224 224Interaction/Center\224 and the noise appear as globally more important they are not the top-3 factors for 20 of the 20 results obtained An average over two sets of results can limit this percentage to 5 of the 20 003 19  380 possible combinations 9

Figure 20  3D trajectories of the aircraft and launcher Figure 21  Comparison of the Morris and Sobol's methods for the complete simulation The results obtained with the Morris and the Sobol's methods are consistent The Sobol's method show seven factors standing out and six of them are over the Limit 1 shown in Figure 21 However the interaction on the z axis of the aircraft ranked fourth with the Sobol's method is under the Limit 1 The interaction on the z axis of the launcher ranked eighth with the Sobol's method is on the contrary over Limit 1 Thus the Morris method can result in a type I and a type II error if the Limit 1 is chosen to distinguish the important factors These errors can either be due to the variability of the results linked to the samples used and revealed by the quite large percentages with different signs or they can also be due to the classic variability of the Morris between the different possible trajectories The Limit 2 more conservative should thus be used Most importantly the results obtained for the noise are equivalent in the two methods in spite of the arbitrary choices made for the Morris elementary effects of the noise The interaction on the y axis of the launcher on its center of pressure and on its z axis play a major role The free stream center of pressure of the launcher is very important as well As expected the opening problems of the hooks also have a large in\003uence on the dynamics and the time delay before the last hook opens appears as one of the main factors Finally another major factor is the initial slip angle of the 002xation between the launcher and the aircraft Table 3  Sobol's total order indexes for the complete simulation 1 Launcher Interaction/Y 0.477 2 Noise 0.364 3 Launcher Interaction/Center 0.317 4 Aicraft Interaction/Z 0.215 5 Hook/Time 0.203 6 Center of pressure 0.166 7 Slip angle 0.134 8 Launcher Interaction/Z 0.054 9 and following 0.053 0.045 0.028 0.019 0.012 0.006 0.006 0.003 0 Table 4  Sobol's total order indexes with the global in\003uence including amplitude 1 Interaction/Center 0.630 2 Interaction/Y 0.357 3 Noise  Noise/Amplitude 0.208 4 Mass/Aircraft 0.011 5 Interaction/Z 0.010 6 Interaction/X 0.002 7 Launcher/Mass 0 Global in\003uence including amplitude This method is tested with a simpli\002ed store separation simulation Two factors are 002rst used for the noise for a total of 8 factors The two noise factors are then merged leaving only 7 factors A different atmospheric context is de\002ned for this study While the uncertainty on the wind amplitude previously followed a uniform distribution on 0  4 0    this interval is now set to 0 0    The 002rst plot of Figure 22 shows the results with two noise factors and the second plot shows the results when these factors are merged The percentages representing the variability of the results and introduced in Section 4 are low enough to consider the results as reliable On the 002rst plot the two initial wind factors do not clearly stand out compared to the factors with lower in\003uence Merging them simpli\002es the calculation and most importantly shows that the global in\003uence of the noise clearly stands out Indeed the second plot shows that its average elementary effect is 2  5 times larger than the next one The two plots should not be directly compared and should be considered independently as they are based on different trajectories To con\002rm the results obtained with Morris when the two noise factors are merged the Sobol's method is applied with 512 simulations The same three factors stand out as shown in table 4 This illustrating example shows that this method can be an important tool However it is not applied on the full simulation because the in\003uence of the noise already stands out Subparts in\003uence This method is applied on the full simulation of the store simulation The simulation lasts 1  5 seconds and the store separation starts after 1  1 seconds The noise is 002rst divided in two equal parts one for the time interval 0 0    and one for 0  75 1    The in\003uence of each part of the noise is 12
