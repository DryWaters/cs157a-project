ICSSE 2011 Mining Fuzzy Temporal Knowledge from Quantitative Transactions Chun-Hao Chen 1 1 Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering Tamkang University Taipei, 251, Taiwan, R.O.C chchen@mail.tku.edu.tw Tzung-Pei Hong 2, 3  2 Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering National University of Kaohsiung Kaohsiung, 811, Taiwan, R.O.C tphong@nuk.edu.tw Shih-Bin Lin 3 3 Department of Computer Science and Engineering National Sun Yat-sen University Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan, R.O.C shinbinxp@gmail.com Abstract In this paper, we propose a data mining algorithm for deriving fuzzy temporal association rules. It first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set using the given membership functions. Meanwhile, item lifespans are collected and recorded in a temporal information table during the transformation process. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term of each item. The mining process based on fuzzy counts and item lifespans is then performed to find fuzzy temporal association rules. Experiments on a simulation dataset are also made to show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approach Keywords fuzzy set, fuzzy data mining, fuzzy temporal association rule, item lifespan I I NTRODUCTION Data mining is commonly used for inducing association rules from transaction data. An association rule is an expression X Y where X and Y are a set of items. It means in the set of transactions, if all the items in X exist in a transaction, then Y is also in the transaction with a high probability [1 Mo st  previous studies focused on binary-valued transaction data Transactions in real-world applications, however, usually consist of quantitative values. Besides, each item has its publication data. It means that each item has its lifespan. Thus designing a sophisticated data-mining algorithm able to deal with various types of data presents a challenge to workers in this research field Fuzzy set theory has been used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning [5, 7 Se ver a l fuz z y da t a m i ni ng  algorithms for inducing rules from given sets of data have been designed and used to good effect with specific domains [3, 6, 8 14   C h an et  al  pr o pos e d an  F-APACS algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules [3 Kuo k e t a l  proposed a fuzzy mining approach to handle numerical data in databases and derived fuzzy association rules [8 A t  n ear ly th e s a m e  tim e Hon g e t  al  proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm to mine fuzzy rules from quantitative transaction data [6  Yu e et  al  then extended the above concept to find fuzzy association rules with weighted items from transaction data [1   However, those fuzzy data mining approaches didn’t take item lifespan into consideration. Although Lee proposed two algorithms for discovering fuzzy temporal association rules and fuzzy periodic association rules by using fuzzy calendar algebra [1  lif es pan of ea ch  i t em still d i dn  t b e c o n s id e r e d   In  this paper, we thus propose a mining algorithm for deriving fuzzy temporal association rules from given temporal transaction database. It first transforms each quantitative value into fuzzy sets using the given membership functions. During the transformation process, the lifespan of item is collected and recorded in temporal information table. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term of each item. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy temporal association rules Experiments on a simulation dataset were also made to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach II P ROBLEM S TATEMENT AND D EFINITIONS Since new products are added to market continuously, it is reasonable to take time factor of items into consideration. In other words, each item in transaction thus has its own lifespan According to [4  th e t e m por al it em tem p o r al t r an s a cti on  database and temporal support are defined as follows Definition 1 Temporal item Let P p 1  p 2  p n be a sequence of continuous time periods such that each period is a particular time granularity, e.g., day, week, month, year, etc  1  i  j  n  p i occurs before p j denoted as p i  p j A temporal item x is an item with its starting period, denoted as S  x   The starting period of a temporal itemset X is then S  X  max S  x where x  X The set of temporal items is denoted as I s.t  x  I  S  x   p n  Definition 2 Temporal Transaction Database\. A temporal transaction T is a subset of I which means T  I The occurring period of T is denoted as O  T   Then D  T | p 1  O  T   p n is a temporal transaction database on I over P Definition 3 Temporal Support Let D be a temporal transaction database on I over P Let X be a set of temporal items  The temporal support of X with respect to the subset of D from the period p i  denoted as TSup  X, p i s defined as 978-1-61284-471-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on System Science and Engineering, Macau, China - June 2011 405 


ICSSE 2011                      D T p T O T D T p T O T X T p X TSup i i i        Then the temporal support of X denoted as TSup  X can be computed as TSup  X, S  X   That is, the temporal support of an itemset X is the ratio of the number of transactions that contain temporal itemsets X to the total number of transactions that occur from S  X  From above definitions, we can find that many previous studies focused on handling binary-valued data have been proposed. Transaction data, however, are usually quantitative values. We thus define temporal quantitative item and temporal quantitative transaction database by extending definition 1 and 2, respectively. The definitions are shown as follows Definition 4 Temporal Quantitative item Let P p 1  p 2  p n be a sequence of continuous time periods such that each period is a particular time granularity, e.g., day, week month, year, etc  1  i  j  n  p i occurs before p j denoted as p i  p j A temporal quantitative item x consists of a temporal item x and a quantitative value v denoted as x  v where v is a positive real number R In other words, the temporal item is a special case of temporal quantitative item. The starting period of a temporal quantitative item x denoted as S  x is the same as temporal item x which is S  x   In the same ways, the starting period of a temporal quantitative itemset X is S  X max  S  x where x  X The set of temporal quantitative items is denoted as I s.t  x  I  S  x   p n  Definition 5 Temporal Quantitative Transaction Database A temporal quantitative transaction T is a subset of I which means T  I The occurring period of T is denoted as O  T   Then D  T’ | p 1  O  T   p n is a temporal quantitative transaction database on I over P For example, Table 1 is a temporal quantitative transaction database with five temporal quantitative transactions over two periods P  P 1  P 2 The time granularity used in this example is day. There are five temporal items. That is I A B, C, D, E}. Each temporal quantitative item has its own starting period, e.g S  A and S  A D Each temporal quantitative transaction also has its own starting period, e.g the starting period O T of the 4 th transaction is 2 Table 1: The five temporal quantitative transactions Period TID Items P 1 Aug-5 Trans 1 A, 5\, \(C,4 Trans 2 A, 3\, \(B,2 Trans 3 C,4 P 2 Aug-6 Trans 4 A, 3\, \(B, 2\, \(D,4 Trans 5 A, 3\, \(B, 5\, \(D,4\, \(E,2 Besides, since fuzzy theory is also commonly used to deal with quantitative values, in this paper, we thus utilize fuzzy theory to transform quantitative values into a more friendly representation such that we can easily understand. Assumer a given set of membership functions, a quantitative value v j t  which is the quantitative value of temporal item x  I j n transaction T i can be transformed into a fuzzy set represented as      l l j i j j i j j i j R f R f R f  2 2 1 1   where R jk is the k th fuzzy region linguistic term\ of temporal item I j f j i is v j i s membership value in region jk R and l  I j   is the number of fuzzy regions for I j Then, we define the fuzzy temporal support of a fuzzy region and fuzzy temporal confidence as follows Definition 6 Fuzzy temporal Support A fuzzy temporal support of a fuzzy region R jk of a temporal item x  I j is defined as follows tFuzzySupport jk  count jk  T O T   S  I j  T  D  where count jk is the scalar cardinality of the fuzzy region R jk  which is the summation of membership values f jk i In other words, the fuzzy temporal support of a fuzzy region of a temporal item is the ratio of its scalar cardinality to the number of transactions that occur from the starting period of temporal item x  Let s is a temporal q itemset with items s 1  s 2  s q  q  2. Similarity, a fuzzy temporal support of fuzzy regions R s of a temporal itemset X  s s defined as tFuzzySupport s  count s  T O T   S  s  T  D  where count s is the scalar cardinality of the fuzzy regions R s  which is the summation of membership values f s i Note that if the minimum operator is used for the intersection, the membership value is calculated as  i s r j i s j f Min f 1 1       Thus, the fuzzy temporal support of fuzzy regions of a temporal itemset X is the ratio of its scalar cardinality to the number of transactions that occur from the starting period of temporal item X  Definition 7 Fuzzy temporal Confidence Let s is a temporal large q itemset with items s 1  s 2  s q  q  2. Then fuzzy temporal confidence of a fuzzy temporal association rule which denoted as s 1    s k-1  s k+1    s q s k is defined as follows tFuzzyConf  s 1    s k-1  s k+1    s q s k      s s  1  1 2 1 q k k s s s s ort tFuzzySupp ort tFuzzySupp    In this paper, given a temporal quantitative transaction database, a set of membership functions, and pre-defined parameters whose are a minimum fuzzy temporal support  a minimum fuzzy temporal confidence value  we attempt to design an algorithm for mining fuzzy temporal association rules from the temporal quantitative transaction database 406 


ICSSE 2011 III R EIVIEW O F R ELATED M INING A PPROACHES The goal of data mining is to discover important associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of some other items. To achieve this purpose, Agrawal and his co-workers proposed several mining algorithms based on the concept of large itemsets to find association rules in transaction data [1, 2    In fuzzy data mining approaches, Chan et al. proposed FAPACS algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules [3   T h ey  first transformed quantitative attribute values into linguistic terms and then used the adjusted difference analysis to find interesting associations among attributes. Kuok et al  proposed a fuzzy mining approach to handle numerical data in databases and derived fuzzy association rules [8 ne ar l y t h e sam e  time, Hong et al  proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm to mine fuzzy rules from quantitative transaction data [6   B a s i ca l l y   these fuzzy mining algorithms first used membership functions to transform each quantitative value into a fuzzy set in linguistic terms and then used a fuzzy mining process to find fuzzy association rules. Yue et al  then extended the above concept to find fuzzy association rules with weighted items from transaction data [14 T h e y adop t e d K o ho ne n s e l f organized mapping to derive fuzzy sets for numerical attributes. In addition, Lee et al  proposed a mining algorithm which used multiple minimum supports to mine fuzzy association rules T h e y  assu m e d t h a t i t e m s  had d i ffe re nt  minimum supports and the minimum support for an itemset was set as the maximum of the minimum supports of the items contained in the itemset. Under the constraint, the characteristic of level-by-level processing was kept, such that the original Apriori algorithm could easily be extended to finding large itemsets In temporal data mining, Chen et al. first proposed an algorithm, namely Progressive-Partition-Miner \(PPM\or mining general temporal association rules from population database w h e r e t h e pub l i c a t i o n da t a b a s e  i s a set o f  transactions. And, each item in the database contains its own exhibition period. Then, Chen et al. extends PPM algorithm and proposed Standing for Segmented Progressive Filter \(SPF for items with different exhibition periods [1  B a s e d on  Chen’s approach [10, 12   C h en et  a l  th en  p r op os ed a  m i n i n g  approach for deriving temporal indirect associations [4  As to fuzzy temporal data mining, since fuzzy calendar algebra helps users to describe temporal requirements in fuzzy temporal calendars easily, Lee proposed two temporal patterns that are fuzzy temporal association rules and fuzzy periodic association rules based on fuzzy calendar algebra [1  B a s e d  on Lee’s approach, Zhuo et al. introduced a relativity-based interest measure value for mining fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules [13   IV T HE P ROPOSED M INING A LGORITHM In this section, we will describe the proposed mining algorithm, namely Fuzzy temporal Association Rule Mining approach \(called FTARM\, for deriving fuzzy temporal association rules from the given temporal databases. The details of the proposed mining algorithm are stated as follows The proposed FTARM algorithm INPUT: A body of n temporal quantitative transactions, each item in transaction has its own lifespan, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support threshold  a predefined minimum confidence threshold   OUTPUT: A set of fuzzy temporal association rules Step 1: Do the following substeps to transform temporal quantitative transactions in each time period p t  t 1 to h into fuzzy representations and collect items lifespans SubSetp 1.1: Transform the quantitative value v j i of each transaction datum D i for each temporal item I j in time period p t where i 1 to n  j 1 to m into a fuzzy set f j i represented as       l l j i j j i j j i j R f R f R f  2 2 1 1   using the given membership functions, where R jk is the k th fuzzy region \(linguistic term\ of item I j f j i is v j i s fuzzy membership value in region jk R and l   I j   is the number of fuzzy regions for I j  SubStep 1.2: Record number of temporal transactions in time period p t denoted as p t and the starting period of each temporal item, denoted as S  I j to a Temporal Information table, denoted as TI table Each item in transaction thus has its own lifetime Step 2: Calculate the scalar cardinality of each fuzzy region linguistic term R jk in the temporal transaction data    n i i jk jk f count 1  Step 3: Calculate the fuzzy temporal support of each fuzzy region count jk according to the starting period of temporal item S  I j ollows tFuzzySupport jk  count jk   h I S t t j p      Step 4: Check whether the fuzzy temporal support of each fuzzy region is larger than or equal to the predefined minimum support value  If R jk satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of large 1-itemsets 1 L  That is L 1   R jk  tFuzzySupport jk   1  j  m and 1  k  l  Step 5: If 1 L is not null, then do the next step; otherwise, do Step 11 Step 6: Set r 1, where r is used to represent the number of temporal items in the current itemsets to be processed Step 7: Join the large itemsets L r to generate the candidate set C r+1 in a way similar to that in the apriori algorithm except that two regions \(linguistic terms\ging to the same item cannot simultaneously exist in an itemset in C r+1 Restated, the algorithm first joins L r and L r under the condition that r 1 items in the two itemsets are the same and the other one is different. It then keeps in C r+1 the itemsets which have all their 407

They were implemented in C++ on a personal computer with AMD Athlon\(tm\ 64X2 Dual Core Processor 4800+ 2.5GHz and 3GB RAM. 64 items and 10,000 transactions were used in the experiments. In this experiment, we assume that all items have the same membership functions, and are shown in Figure 2 Figure 2: The memnership functions used in the experiments The experiment was first made to show the comparison results in terms of execution times between the proposed approach \(TFARM\ and the previous approach \(FAR  T h e execution times along with different minimum supports are shown in Figure 3 Figure 3: The execution times of the proposed approach and the previous approach From Figure 3, it is easily to observe that the execution times of both approaches are increasing when the minimum supports are decreasing. Additionally, the execution time of the proposed approach needs only a little more than the previous approach. The experiments were then made to show the difference of the number rules with different minimum supports. The results are shown in Figure 4 Figure 4: The difference of number of rules between the propsoed approach the previous approach 408 


ICSSE 2011 From Figure 4, we can know that the number of rules derived by proposed approach is larger than the previous approach, especially when the minimum supports are set at small values. In other words, these results mean that there are actually more information \(useful rules\ can be derived by using TFARM. Thus, the proposed approach is effective and efficient VI C ONCLUSION A ND F UTURE W ORKS n this paper, we take item lifespan into consideration and have proposed a fuzzy temporal mining algorithm for mining fuzzy temporal association rules. The proposed approach first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set using the given membership functions. Meanwhile, item lifespans are collected and recorded in temporal information table during the transformation process. Apriori-like concept is then utilized to derive fuzzy temporal association rules. Experiments on a simulation dataset also show the proposed approach can actually derive extra fuzzy rules The main contribution of this paper is that since the lifespan of each item are considered, the proposed approach can find more information inside the given transaction database. In the future, we will extend the proposed approach for solving more complexity problems A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the National Science Council of the Republic of China under contract NSC 99-2218E-032-005 R EFERENCES 1 R A g r a w a l T  I m i e li n k s i an d A  S w a m i  Da t ab a s e m i n i n g a performance perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 5, No. 6, 1993, pp. 914-925 2 R.

The proposed approach focuses on Mining Maximal Frequent Itemset Generation. In this paper, Array based approach and Effective Pruning Mechanism is used for generating Maximal frequent patterns There are two main ingredients to develop an efficient MFI algorithm. The first is the set of techniques used to reduce the size of search space, and the second is the representation used to perform fast frequency computations. This paper describes how proposed algorithm achieves the same  In general the structure of the transactional database may be in two different ways -Horizontal data format and Vertical data format. Here, we are using vertical data format for storing the transactions in the database. In vertical data format, the data is represented as item-tidset format, where item is the name of the item and tidset is the set of transaction identifiers containing the item Consider our example database which includes six different items, I = {A, B, C, D, E, F} and six transactions T= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The vertical data format of the database DB is given below Table 1 : Vertical Data format of the transactional database DB All Frequent items are extracted first. The support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidset of each item. Let us consider the minimum support to be 3 From the above structure, all items except F are frequent The items A, B, C, D and E are frequent items and will be considered to next level In the next level a dynamic array \(N intersecting the tidsets of every two frequent items. The constructed array \(N two frequent items. The size of the array will be n\(n+1 where n is the number of frequent items. Value of each and every cell in the array is initialized to zero. The value of cell N[i,j] is 1 if number of transaction occurred in the intersection of tidset of frequent item i and j satisfies the user specified minimum support. Otherwise the cell value is zero. Once the array is constructed successfully, all possible Maximal frequent itemsets\(PMFI from the array. The constructed array is given below N ABCD 


E D C B  Table 2: Dynamic array \(N frequent items The possible maximal frequent itemsets \(PMFI obtained from this array are considered to the next level All the other itemsets are pruned. The number of possible large itemsets is less than or equal to number of frequent itemsets. From this array, PMFIs are obtained in two ways. We can take all columns and first row. \(Columns A B, C, D and row E Rows E D, C, B and Column A One column entry or one row entry is a single PMFI. For example the itemset \(x,y,z itemset if and only if there is an entry 1 in both cells N[x,y] and N[x,z]. For example ADC is a PMFI because of the values of both cells N [A, D] and N [A, C] is 1 Once all PMFIs are retrieved from the array, they are arranged in descending order with respect to their size First column entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item A \(ADC the PMFI includes the frequent item B \(B entries produce the PMFI that includes the frequent item C CDE the frequent item D \(D PMFI that includes the frequent item E \(EC are arranged in descending order with respect to their size So the Itemsets in PMFI are ADC, CDE, EC, B, D The First itemset ADC has no superset in MFI and it is frequent. So ADC is a MFI\(with support count 3 added to MFI The Second itemset CDE has no superset in MFI and it is a infrequent item set. so all \(n-1 includes C CDE are generated. 2-itemsets of CDE are CD and CE.\(DE is not taken for test. It does not include the item C ignored. CE is frequent and it has no supersets in MFI. So it is added to MFI. CE is a MFI\(with support count 3 obtained from CDE 


The Third itemset EC is already included in MFI and it is ignored The Forth item B has no superset in MFI and it is a frequent item and it is added to MFI The Fifth item D has a superset in MFI and it is ignored From above example, MFIs with support count 3 are ADC, CE, B The process will be continued till testing all possible maximal frequent itemsets. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely The pseudo code for proposed algorithm is given below in figure 1  Item  Tidset A  T1, T2, T3, T4 B  T1, T4, T5 C  T1, T2, T3, T5, T6 D  T1, T2, T3 E  T2, T4, T5, T6 F  T6, T5    Pseudo code Find All MFI\(PMFIs,min_sup all Maximal Frequent Itemsets Inputs i Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets ii for mining process Interfacing Functions Output i Find All MFI\(PMFIs, min_sup For each x  PMFIs if x has a superset in MFI continue else if x is frequent MFI=MFI U x else Find MFI by obtaining Permutations\(x,min_sup For End return MFI

So, the time taken to compute MFI is negligible. As we are following vertical data format, support also need not be calculated separately In this case, support is directly given by the number of transactions in the tidlist of each FI. The vertical representation has the following major advantages over the horizontal layout: Firstly, computing the support of itemsets is simpler and faster with the vertical layout since it involves only the intersections of tidsets. Secondly, with the vertical layout, there is an automatic reduction of the database before each scan in that only those itemsets that are relevant to the following scan of the mining process are accessed from disk Pruning The Possible Maximal Frequent itemsets\(Maximal 


Candidate Itemsets array. All Maximal frequent itemsets are obtained from only these PMFIs. Other itemsets are pruned automatically. The pruning can be done while finding the MFI itself, but not after finding FI completely. The proposed approach applies superset checking to eliminate the non maximal frequent itemsets. Once all PMFIs are generated, each PMFI is checked whether it is a subset of any maximal pattern. If so the itemset is eliminated entirely. Counting is not performed for this itemset and next PMFI is taken for test IV. RESULTS The testing of the proposed algorithm has been carried out on the real dataset \(containing long itemsets the number of candidate itemsets taken by the proposed algorithm to find MFIs and it is compared to Genmax algorithm for various values of minimum support. The support is varied from 75 to 95. The proposed algorithm had been compared with GenMax algorithm and results show the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets to find all MFIs Figure 2 illustrates that, the proposed approach generates less number of candidate itemsets and produces all MFIs very quickly than GenMax algorithm. Support is taken as x axis and the number of candidate itemsets taken to find all MFI is taken as y axis For Mushroom, the improvement is best explained by how the MFI is computed at each level and found directly without waiting for FI completely. This leads to a much greater reduction in the overall search space, since the reductions is so great at highest levels  Figure 2. Number of Candidate itemsets taken by ABMFI and GenMax Algorithm from Mushroom dataset This approach will be working very efficiently for any sparse and dense dataset, when the size of maximal frequent itemsets is close to the number of frequent itemsets V.

experts can start their ore deposits estimations with much clearer data which is easier to deal with XII. CONCLUSION We have presented how data mining can be applied to the borehole data coming from active mine area. We are certain that data mining has a huge potential for other types of borehole data. One of the important steps in data mining is the preparation of data into useful form for various algorithms. Together with domain experts we have identified a way for transforming data to a form acceptable to k-NN classification and association rules mining algorithms Although we have shown how the k-NN classification and association rules mining techniques can be applied here this framework will open new possibilities to perform other data mining tasks to this type of data. Our experimental results are very promising in this regard as they show that we are not only able to match the accuracy of the results with IDW method used in the mining industry, but also exceed it \(93.1% accuracy was obtained by 3-NN method while IDW gave 88.5% accuracy rules as a separate analysis tool can improve not only k-NN classification results but also IDW interpolation results. This is particularly important for convincing mining companies 119 of the benefits of data mining, as with a little effort they can improve the method they are already using As we have shown in this paper, not only choosing right classification techniques can help us to improve interpolation, but more general analysis on data like association rules can contribute a lot. Thus, the more knowledge we have on the hidden relationships and patterns the more accurately you can construct an interpolation. Moreover, discovering hidden correlations not only important for this task, but also can contribute to understanding about complex geological processes that this specific area undergone. Therefore data mining, which can discover useful knowledge purely from data is of great importance and will be area of research for next generation of exploration and mining specialists Finally, we have proposed to use mathematical morphology for filtering the results of rock type interpolation. In the example given here, we have seen that it performed well in removing relatively small objects and filtering out large 


areas of interest from rock types XIII. FUTURE WORK This paper provides a framework for using data mining techniques on the borehole data. Using this framework we would like to investigate possibilities of using other classification techniques on this type of data. We mentioned that borehole data can contain more information about the area besides spatial coordinates, rock types and metal grades so classification that utilizes this extra information will be on our immediate research agenda Application of mathematical morphology provides possibilities for further research on domaining \(filtering out large areas of interest be given also to this ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I want to thank the Director of the WH Bryan Mining and Geology Research Centre, at the University of Queensland Professor Alan Bye and his PhD student Mr Younes Fadakar Alghalandis for contributing their expertise to this research This work is supported by the AuScope National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy by the Australian Commonwealth, the Queensland State Government and The University of Queensland REFERENCES 1] A.
