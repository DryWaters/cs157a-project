st century.  The first step is to increase the data rate provided to science missions to at least the 100 Mbps range.  This is under way using Ka-band 26 GHz, erecting an 18-meter antenna for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the planned upgrade of the Deep Space Network \(DSN\eter network to support the James Webb Space Telescope \(JWST 12  The next step is the support of manned missions to the Moon and beyond.  Establishing an outpost with several activities such as rovers, colonization, and observatories, is better achieved by using a network configuration rather than the current method of point-to-point.  Another challenge associated with the Moon is communication coverage with 
the Earth.  The Moon’s South Pole, targeted for human habitat and exploration, is obscured from Earth view for half of the 28-day lunar cycle and requires the use of lunar relay satellites to provide coverage for the times when there is no direct view of the Earth The future NASA and Constellation network architecture is described in the Space Communications Architecture Working Group \(SCAWG Communications and Navigation \(SCAN\Constellation Integration Project \(SCIP\s responsible for coordinating Constellation requirements and has assigned the responsibility for implementing these requirements to the existing NASA communication providers: DSN, Space Network \(SN\work \(GN\he NASA 
Integrated Services Network \(NISN The SCAWG Report provides a future architecture but does not provide implementation details.  The architecture calls for a Netcentric system, using hundreds of 12-meter antennas, a ground antenna array, and a relay network 1  1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25 00 ©2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1020, Version 5 Updated November 13, 2007 around the Moon.

NASA’s network communication is provided by the SN, DSN and GN.  Missions select their provider based primarily on the distance from Earth 


 2 Lagrange points seem to be the dividing point between Deep Space and Near-Earth missions The Exploration program will be initially implemented on the Moon and then on Mars.  To implement these missions NASA networks are required to provide a seamless and integrated view to the users This is a major change from the current situation where each network provider has different interfaces, navigation approaches, and services For example, the SN provides bent pipe” bit service that does not process users’ data, whereas the DSN provides clean packet” services where each packet is examined and processed to remove errors.  The networks use a different navigation scheme; the SN uses a pseudo noise \(PN and DSN uses Tone ranging The Constellation program defi nes its interface requirement on the Internet Protocol \(IP\er.  A summary of IP interface is described below a nd depicted in Figure 1   IP provides interoperability across the entire network both Constellation elements and infrastructure are appropriate for lunar networking   Large number of heterogeneous assets in terms of communications capability and mobility   Dynamic network topology and traffic loading opportunistic generation of a mixture of real-time and delay tolerant data   Automation of data routing and prioritization enables seamless functioning of the network through different mission phases: International short stay\and Lunar outpost   Above the IP layer, the transport, framework, and application should largely remain the same.  The higher layers should be independent of the physical, operating environments Above the IP layer, the protocol stack will remain homogeneous across most lunar network elements              Figure 1 – IP Integration The Constellation C3I \(Command, Control Communications, and Information\fication specifies the use of the Space Network navigation signal, based on Pseudo Noise, in support of the Crew Exploration Vehicle CEV ively SN.  This effectively will be the Navigation \(NAV\used throughout the lunar program In order to provide support for the lunar missions, the following architecture elem ents were identified   Tracking and Data Relay  Satellite System \(TDRSS\r ISS and Low-Earth Orbit \(LEO   Earth-based ground stations at existing NASA sites   Two Lunar Relay Satellites   Lunar surface network based on industry 802.xx and a Lunar Communication  Tower \(LCT Figure 2 depicts the lunar system elements and components The paper also describes the evolution of the architecture for each of the lunar communica tion elements with the goal of providing a complete end-to-end integrated system The topics include   IP Networking   Use of the same radio frequencies and protocols providing forward compatibility to the future Orion vehicle   Surface network 802.xx   S-band vs. Ka-band for mobility users   Coverage and availability requirements   Requires use of Q-band \(37/40 Ka-band\o new spectrum restrictions on Ku-band

Orion’s first mission will be to the ISS and it will communicate using the existing TDRSS \(an artist’s concept of a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite \(TDRS\is shown in Figure 3\SS provides excellent coverage of low-Earth orbiti ng spacecraft and is currently used by the Shuttle and ISS.  TDRSS supports S-band in Multiple Access \(MA\mode, S-band in Single Access \(SA mode, Ku-band, and Ka-band \(23 to 26 Giga-Hertz   TDRSS uses the Ku-band for trunk line transmissions to the White Sands and Guam tracking stations.  For ranging TDRSS uses a PN spread spect rum signal.  The TDRSS PN signal used for tracking is different than the tracking system used by the DSN and GN, which use a tone-based tracking system. The TDRSS communication signal established by CEV at this phase will be that used by CEV throughout the Exploration Program.  For lunar missions, TDRSS will support the building of the Lunar Stack, composed of the CEV and Lunar Surface Access Module \(LSAM\in low earth orbit \(LEO To support the ISS phase of the Exploration Program TDRSS is planning two future satellites, “K” and “L”, to be in place in time to support these missions  Figure 3 – TDRS The IP support is a new paradigm for TDRSS as it requires a shift from bit to packet services. Currently TDRSS is a bent pipe”, which provides a physical extension of the network without reformatting the user data.  This is also referred to as “Bit services In the packet service the network provider processes packets of data at a time Packet services require the network provider to de-modulate users’ data based on coding sc heme, modulation, and packet structure.  Higher level data framing is still under discussion as to the need and type of framing The Constellation C3I specification defines a 10e-8 Bit Error Rate \(BER\of Low Density Parity Check Code \(LDPC block/packet \(frame The implementation of LDPC will require modifications to see Figure 4  Mission Control Mission Control TDRSS/LRS Network TDRSS//LRSS Mission Ops Center LMOC Monitor and Coordination Scheduling LRS2 Terminals \(LGT DTE/CEV LRS2 CEV LSAM LCT Habitat ROVER DTE/CEV LCT Q-band 100/250 Mbps Ka 23/26 25/100 Mbps S-band 72/192 Ka 23/26 25/150 Mbps S-band 72/192 CEV TDRSS Key Tan: LRS, TDRSS DTE Green: LRS Trunk RED LCT-SURFACE Blue TDRSS Trunk Ku NAV EVA 802.xx NAV  CEV-ISS

The DSN has already begun upgrading existing 34-meter Beam Wave Guide \(BWG\ennas with 26-Ghz Ka-band.  In addition the White Sands facility is currently constructing an 18meter antenna for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter \(LRO called WS-1.  To support lunar missions, DSN-34 and WS1 will need to be upgraded w ith S-band TDRSS-compatible signals and IP.  Two additional 18-meter antennas at the DSN sites at Canberra, Australia and Madrid, Spain will be built if needed to offload the 34-meter BWGs The cost and implementation scheduled for TDRSS SGLT are under study to be completed by November 2007 to define the implementation approach to support the Constellation C3I specification 3  E ARTH B ASED G ROUND S TATIONS  The second element supporting the Lunar Mission is Earthbased ground stations that support the CEV stack once it leaves GEO, beyond the coverage of TDRSS satellites CEV will use the same S-band and Ka-band radio used for the ISS to communicate to the ground stations The proposed approach has two issues   Ka-band performance is affect ed by rain attenuation Ka requires more power \(dB\pared to S, X and Ku bands to provide the same reliability.  The LAT team accepted the above issues.  The Ka performance will be mitigated by using the 34-meter antenna, rather than 18-meter, to close the link   DSN/White Sands sites provide 98% coverage of the Moon, as shown in Figure 5.  The red  triangle near Africa is the gap in coverage Once the DSN and WS-1 become “lunar compatible”, all three networks – SN, GN and DSN – will provide a similar interface

Several different analysis studies concluded that the lunar outpost should be supported with a combination of relay satellites and lunar surface communication assets.  The Lunar Communication Tower LCT\e users within a proximity of 6 kilometers Beyond 6 kilometers, the Lunar Relay Satellite \(LRS provides coverage, as depicted in Figure 8 The surface network will be provided by using IP applications over a commercial 802.16 network.  The LCT serves as a network hub and will be attached by fiber optics to the Habitat network \(Hab\T provides wireless services over 802.11 to users such as Rovers and ExtraVehicular Activity \(EVA\ety of internal networks and creates 100 megabits per second Mbps\ch are sent via LCT primarily to Earth via the LRS.  The internal Hab network is based mainly on 802.11 see Figure 6\ure study is required to consolidate the Hab 802.11 with the surface 802.16 network and reduce the number of interfaces The proposed LCT has a mass of over 400 kg and uses 400 watts.  Much of the power demand is attributed to supporting a wireless network hub of 80 Mbps.  We expect a major push back on the LCT power and mass requirements 


 6  Figure 6 – Hab Network Data Flow  5  S URFACE N ETWORK   M OBILE U SERS  The roving users, including the Rovers and astronauts, have more challenging navigation and communication demands than stationary users, who are connected to the Hab and LCT network.  Once beyond a 6-km range from the LCT roving users depend on their own radios and antennas to communicate with the Relay Satellite.  In addition to the surface-to-surface network, mobile users require in-situ  voice and navigation capabilities \(see Figure 7\.  Lunar users will not have the benefit of the Earth’s Global Positioning System \(GPS\e LRS will provide in-situ  navigation and communication services to roving elements Navigation will be provided using TDRSS format PN code over S-band.  The Relay satellite will produce a two-way signal to calculate the roving element’s location and transmit it to the Rover.  The Rovers will use Ka-band to transmit video and voice to a LRS for forwarding to the Hab and Earth.  The Rovers’ data rate will be approximately 10 Mbps Providing communications to Rovers will be challenging The Rovers produce pictures and data at about 10 Mbps which typically requires Ka band.  The Ka-band beam is about 10 times narrower than S-band and requires more accurate pointing.  \(Figure 8 shows LRS coverage between S-band and Ka-band\S S-band beam covers 250 km while Ka covers about 30 km   LRS Use r  IMU Landmark Tracking LRS LN 1 & 2-Way S-Band Doppler  range LN 1-Way S-Band Doppler  range

 8              Figure 8 – Relay S/Ka Coverage  The team designing the roving elements has expressed concern over using a gimbaled antenna due to lunar dust and would prefer an omni-type approach.  A future study will determine if Rovers can use S-band at rates higher than 150 Kbps \(3 Mbps\ adding S-band Frequency Division Multiple Access \(FDMA The other challenge is supporting emergency EVA.  For nominal operations, EVA will use the Rover as a gateway for emergency EVA, direct communication with the relay is required.  The EVA suit has limited RF power \(less than 1 watt\ and an omni antenna, resulting in a communication link to the relay limited to 2.4 Kbps, which is not enough to provide Voice Over IP \(VOIP\ultiple users sharing the same receiver the S-band system uses the TDRSS design based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA\ CDMA works well when users have similar transmit power \(for example cell phone users have similar devices with same power\ The EVA transmit power is significantly lower than the rover and may get overwhelmed by RF noise created by rovers stronger signal \(aka noise floor level\itting simultane ously to same receiver The EVA group has also expressed a need for HighFrequency \(HF\radio which may remove the need for contacting the Rover via S-band  6  L UNAR R ELAY S ATELLITES  The LAT recognized the need for relay satellites and has manifested two relays in support of manned outposts \(LRS2 and LRS-3\.  The relay satellites provide in-situ  navigation to orbiting and roving assets.  The Relays also provide in-situ communication to roving assets back to the Hab zone, eliminating a 3-second propagation delay associated with the time to send a signal to Earth The Relays will also play a major role in supporting an outpost that will be located at the Lunar South Pole.  The South Pole is blocked from Earth view for 14 days out of the 28-day cycle.

The spectrum assigned by the SCAWG to the lunar relay does not allow the use of TDRSS Ku-band and calls for using Ka-band \(40 / 37 GHz\gn uses four 18meter, dedicated LRS ground stations at DSN and White Sands; three for user support and one for housekeeping The LAT design provides a minimal configuration for operations and does not addre ss rain diversity and backup between ground stations.  A possible future consideration is building an additional station in South Africa Hartebeesthoek\estern Australia \(Dongara The Relay Satellites are key to integrating constellation elements.  In order for relays to provide navigation capability to orbiting elements, they need to be compatible with the CEV network stack.  For in-situ communications they connect the Hab, Rovers, a nd the Earth.  They are also the primary connection between the LCT and Earth.  To provide all these capabilities, the Relay provides routing capabilities described below and shown in Figure 10     Figure 10 – Relay Router   LRS receives IP packets from   Earth: LRS Mission Operations Center \(MOC inter-leaves user and LRS Telemetry and Command \(T&C\ and forwards to Relay using Q-band 40 Ghz   Surface: data from LCT and Rovers   CEV   LRS demodulates IP stream   Reads IP header and determines network path   Keep on LRS \(C&T   Forward to CEV   Forward to surface via LCT or Rover   Forward to Earth   Establishes physical connection \(Q-band, Ka , Sband\o appropriate node The LRS router is required to process at a rate of 250 Mbps.

VOIP Hyper Text Markup Language \(HTML\ensible Markup XML\and MPEG are some of the applications, languages and formats using IP.  Below the IP layer the system needs to address protocols and physical layers The physical backbone of terrestrial networks is based on fiber optics, which provides high data rates with low error rate \(10e-14\art routers.  This physical backbone is the basis for successful IP implementation.  Wireless terrestrial networks are limited in distance and connected to a gateway hub with fiber optics for accessing the Internet The Lunar network has several challenges which need to be addressed Space long-haul RF links perform the function of terrestrial networks fiber optics.  Longhaul space links provide 10e-5 BER and require coding schemes to reduce BER.  Coding increases the amount of data transmitted and requires computers to detect errors and correct them.  Convolutional Encoding, Reed Solomon, Low Density Parity Check LDPC\ are commonly used codes.  High data rates and fast computing capabilities require AC power which is a scarce resource in space applications.  \(As discussed earlier, the LCT requires 400 kg and 400 watts The Constellation C3I specification which defines the protocol stack \(described in Figure 11\o communicate with the CEV, specifies using LDPC.  The TDRS SGLTs currently support Convolutional Encoding and Reed Solomon.  Supporting LDPC will require changing out existing TDRS Integrated Receivers \(IR bits”.  The ability to change out over ninety receivers in time to support the first CEV mission is questionable To communicate to the LRS, the LCT or Rovers will be used as gateways to route the IP data using the C3I stack established during the ISS phase \(see Figure 11\ The LAT design has one central LCT and one or two hubs on Rovers The above approach requires a ssets at additional locations beyond the Habitat zone to deploy their own gateway Another item to be considered is the number of available LRS links.  The LRS has a limited number of channels available.  In order for the Lunar architecture to be independent from predetermined Earth scheduling, the LRS requires a mechanism which allows demand access.  A Demand Asigned Multiple Access \(DAMA\over Sband is being considered The lunar surface has some a dvantages that NASA should consider.  The lunar surface has fewer sources of interference than Earth; i.e., no buildings, power lines weather, or other radio sources.  A more detailed future analysis of lunar surface should be performed and the performance of 802.16 to Lunar surface adjusted accordingly based on LRO re sults provided in 2009 Another advantage around the Moon is less spectrum restriction.  Being the only us ers, the Surface-to-Relay can use the assigned spectrum in a more liberal fashion than users on Earth.  For example, S-band users can be allocated bands wider than 5 Megahert z \(MHz\or use more efficient modulation schemes \( 8 PSK instead of QPSK\ to around 10 Mbps over S-band NASA is not the only agency trying to move to an IP in space Netcentric architecture.  The Department of Defense DoD\obile ground troops with voice, data, and images over IP.  For example the DoD Transformational Communications Satellite TSAT\roject will address some of these issues early enough so they can be incorporated in the lunar design  


 11                Figure 11 – Networks Stacks  8  S UMMARY  The development of the Lunar Network Architecture to address the needs of Orbiters, Rovers, and EVA, requiring in-situ navigation, video, and voice capabilities, is an ongoing, complicated task The first step in building the ar chitecture begins today.  The TDRSS 25-year-old ground in frastructure will require extensive modifications to support IP and LDPC.  The introduction of IP will move TDRSS from “bit” service to frame service and put in place similar capabilities to those of the DSN The Earth-based ground stations provided by DSN will be compatible with the TDRSS system provided for the ISS and effectively provide NASA with a seamless network The Surface and Relay network will be based on industry standard IP router and 802.xx protocols.  More work is needed in making IP work in a lunar environment.  The success of IP on terrestrial networks is attributed, to a large degree, to a fiber optics-based backbone and sophisticated routers.  IP applications require high data rates with low errors, which is very challe nging in space.  The long-haul space links – Surface-to-Relay a nd Relay-to-Earth – will be required to provide enough RF power to close the link to support high data rates with over 100 percent overhead associated with coding.  Another challenge is the development of a space-qualified high-rate IP router The use of multiple 802 prot ocols, including 802.11 and 802.16, adds a burden on the architecture that needs to be addressed Rovers and astronauts’ requirements are challenging.  In addition to limited power, there is a need to develop the lunar equivalent of a GPS Although the network architecture required for lunar support is challenging, the LAT concluded that it is achievable and provided details of configurations and costs needed to build the system.  A combination of push-back on user requirements and levera ging DoD work will go a long way to making the architecture possible  Voice prime LCT LRS Ka-band 40/37 GHz 802.16 PHY 802.16 MAC 802.16 Stack IP Mission Control S/ Ka 23/26 GHz EVA DTE Rover Hab  S/Ka 23/26 GHz 2.4-9 GHz  IP Ethernet HDLC Ethernet stack Low Rate SN \(s-band TBD 802.11 PHY 802.11 MAC 802 .11 Stack IP C3I Ka Stack EVA IP LDPC AOS HDLC Ka-band IP LDPC AOS HDLC CEV   SN \(Ka-band S/Ka 23/26 GHz C3I stack EVA IP LDPC AOS HDLC SN \( S/Ka-band C3I stack DAMA Stack 802.16 Stack Voice prime LCT LRS Ka-band 40/37 GHz 802.16 PHY 802.16 MAC 802.16 Stack IP Mission Control Mission Control S/ Ka 23/26 GHz EVA DTE Rover Hab  S/Ka 23/26 GHz 2.4-9 GHz  IP Ethernet HDLC Ethernet stack Low Rate SN \(s-band TBD 802.11 PHY 802.11 MAC 802 .11 Stack IP C3I Ka Stack EVA IP LDPC AOS HDLC Ka-band IP LDPC AOS HDLC CEV   SN \(Ka-band S/Ka 23/26 GHz C3I stack EVA IP LDPC AOS HDLC SN \( S/Ka-band C3I stack DAMA Stack 802.16 Stack

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
