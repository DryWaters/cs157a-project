AdamRTP: Adaptive Multi-flows Real-time Multimedia Delivery over WSNs  A ni ss Zakaria Ajman University of Science & Technology anas@ajman.ac.ae 001  Randa El-Marakby University of Windsor randaa@uwindsor.ca Abstract - Real-time multimedia applications are time sensitive and require extra resources from the network, e.g. large bandwidth and big memory However Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs suffer from limited resources such as computational storage and bandwidth capabilities Therefore sending real-time multimedia applications over WSNs can be very challenging. For this reason, we propose an Adaptive Multi-flows Real-time Multimedia Transport Protocol AdamRTP that has the ability to ease the process of 
transmitting real-time multimedia over WSNs by splitting the multimedia source stream into smaller independent flows using an MDC-aware encoder then sending each flow to the destination using joint/disjoint path\(s\. AdamRTP uses also dynamic adaptation techniques e.g changing number of flows and rate adaptation Simulations experiments demonstrate that AdamRTP enhances the Quality of Service \(QoS\ of the data transmission. Also, we show that in an ideal WSN using multi-flows consumes less power per node than using a single flow and extends the life-time of the network  Keywords 226  Real-time multimedia Multi-flow RTP RR AdamRTP QoS, Wireless Sensor Network \(WSN  I. INTRODUCTION The rapid advancement in Micro Electro Mechanical 
Systems MEMS and wireless communication technologies has enabled the integration of sensing actuation processing and wireless communication capabilities into tiny sensor devices Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs are composed of many tiny low-cost low-power and scattered devices called sensor nodes Each node integrates a processor memory transceiver, and power source into one small device that has the ability to observe process and send data about observed phenomenon to its neighboring nodes destined to a central processing unit mainly referred to as a sink A sensor node should have the ability to process as much information locally as possible instead of just disseminating raw data to save 
energy because Radio Frequency RF communication is the key energy consumer   U s ua l l y   t h e  m a i n  s o ur c e  o f  e n e r gy  i n  a sensor node is the battery. The lifetime of any node depends on that of the battery. Energy conservation is a main obstacle to any proposed protocol in sensor networks while maintaining high Quality of Service QoS measurements is the main goal in traditional networks  There is an increasing demand for multimedia applications over all types of wireless networks But with limitations that WSNs has naturally inherited from wireless networks, sending multimedia data can add extra load greater than what a WSN is capable of, due to the fact that WSNs have limited processing power limited energy source and limited bandwidth 
Multimedia applications require extra memory and cache In addition, they require large bandwidth for acceptable quality Current real-time multimedia protocols such as the Realtime Transport Protocol RTP  a r e  de s i g n e d t o  s e n d  r e a l time multimedia data Implementing such protocols directly over WSNs is not practical For example the RTP protocol is not power-aware. It does not consider the amount of power any node has in the decision of joining or leaving a session or being a part of a path that forwards the traffic Moreover RTP was designed to work over IP-based networks, such as the Internet WLAN, etc\205 Achieving good QoS comes at the price of network resources such as bandwidth and power Our main goal is to 
send real-time multimedia over WSNs while preserving good QoS and extending the lifetime of the network. Because a WSN has limited resources, e.g. bandwidth and power, we use multiflows over multi-paths The sender divides a large stream of data into smaller ones and sends each portion over a separate path if possible By doing this we can relieve intermediate nodes from the burden of transmitting large amount of data Also multimedia traffic is distributed over more nodes Moreover, we use an adaptation technique to adjust transmitted media dynamically according to the current network state. By using both techniques the proposed Adaptive Multi-flows Real-time Multimedia Transport Protocol for WSNs AdamRTP which modifies the RTP protocol helps 
alleviating congestion and providing good QoS and good distribution of power usage to suite the limitations of WSNs This paper is organized as follows Section II presents an overview and the design of our new proposed protocol AdamRTP Section III presents our simulation results Section IV shows some related work. Finally, we conclude II. ADAMRTP This section presents an overview then provides detailed description of AdamRTP and its design architecture followed by adaptation techniques used A  Overview Consider an area that is covered by many sensors that are equipped with audio and video capabilities. Generally, when an event occurs see Fig 1 the sensor node sensing the event 
generates a media representation of the event and divides the stream into many flows using an MDC encoder   T h e n  i t  forwards these flows to the sink over multiple paths. The sink merges the different flows into one stream then decodes the stream by a decoder and makes it available to the user directly or probably over the Internet To accomplish this we assume that each sensor has a fair size of internal cache which can be used to store continuous multimedia \(audio/video\files of the surrounding environment 978-1-4244-5950-6/09/$26.00 ©2009 IEEE 440 


The sensors do not send continuous streams of data to the sink unless an event triggers the source/sender sensor to do so, e.g. a triggered event could be the hearing of the word \223HELP\224 or the detection of a waiving sign. This prolongs the lifetime of each sensor node. The sender sensor is equipped with a coder that is capable of generating multiple flows out of one stream called Multiple Description Coding \(MDC A flow consists of data packets transferred from the sender to the receiver using a certain path, while a session consists of one or more flows which constitute a single real-time multimedia stream between sender and receiver and necessary control packets A path/route is the physical route that a flow uses to reach the destination  Fig. 1. AdamRTP, sender generates media presentation of an event and sends it t o user using multi-flows Each flow is routed to the sink using a different path if po ssible The sender can always start with one or two flows then increases the number of flows up to n flows until something wrong happens, e.g. severe packet loss or failure of an intermediate sensor on the path used AdamRTP may function over any multipath routing protocol such as the Highly-Resilient Energy-Efficient Multipath Routing in WSNs 11  o r  S E E R   1 2    The receiver/sink generates a Receiver Report RR packet every time unit e.g every one second combining statistical information about all previously received flows in the current interval where the interval is the time between issuing the previous RR from the sink and the current RR Based on the RR feedback, the sender tries either to increase the number of flows if the network is uncongested or to minimize the number of flows/lower its transmission rate if there is congestion until the network state goes back to normal B  AdamRTP Description AdamRTP employs no connection establishment mechanism between the sender and the receiver at the beginning of the session.  The sender simply sends the real-time multimedia data to the sink as soon as it detects something In general the multimedia stream goes through the following 5 stages AdamRTP implements the partitioning in stage 1, stage 4, and the reassemble in stage 5 1  Encoding and partitioning  Sensors are equipped with a small and moderate quality camera. For example, a camera which can capture video of resolution 640x480 pixels at 30 frames-per-second can be considered acceptable, adequate and small to fit in one small sensor node Moreover this camera is enough to fulfill the job of delivering a good quality of video The stream of video generated by the camera passes into a coder that compresses and divides it into n flows using an MDC aware coder [1   A d a m R T P  h a s  the ability to compress and partition the video stream using some partitioning methodologies such as thinning and striping 13   O n c e  p a r t i t i o n e d   e a c h  p o r t i o n  i s  a s s i g n e d  a  flow number and an initial sequence number, then the flow is sent to the sink via a separate route, if possible 2  Path Selection and assignment  Usually finding the best route to the sink is the job of the routing protocol AdamRTP assigns only its own header information such as flow id, session id, sequence number, and a time stamp then passes this information to the lower layer 3  Packet routing It is preferable to find disjoint paths to the sink, so we can distribute the stream of data into flows all over the WSN thus saving more power and facing less congestion But this requires a huge amount of overhead trying to find totally disjoint paths from source to destination resulting in a waste of bandwidth and memory 4  QoS feedback  AdamRTP generates periodic statistical QoS reports summarizing the quality received by all previous flows since the last QoS report. However, unlike RTP where the sender and receiver must generate these reports in AdamRTP only the receiver generates the report. This frees the network for more data. The Receiver Report \(RR\ is almost similar to RR in RTP, where it has information about the fraction of packets lost in the current interval, accumulation of packets lost since the beginning of the session highest sequence number received the interarrival jitter and some other values Based on these RRs, sender acts accordingly, i.e. it may increase/decrease quality of media and number of flows 5  Reassembling at the sink Once the sink receives a packet it extracts the session id and flow id from its header and queues it until a complete set of packets received up to a certain time threshold called the playout delay Then the sink decodes the received stream back to its original multimedia file. We assume the sink is more powerful and has more computational capabilities in terms of processor memory, and storage C  AdamRTP Architecture Usually sensors are small in size, so it\222s more convenient to unify a couple of OSI layers or more together to simplify the design 16   T h e r e f o r e   we somehow tried to implement Ad a mRTP to operate over the network layer directly. Although it is not considered to be a pure transport layer or an application layer, it tries to unify the tasks of both layers AdamRTP is a connectionless unreliable protocol that fragments then reassembles packets Large datagrams are broken into small ones to fit the small frame size of AdamRTP When these datagrams arrive at the receiver it reassembles them and merges them back to the original packet format. By using adaptation techniques AdamRTP helps avoid congested  0   1/6<:=CAIOMX][fkjlqpy~|~¡¦¤¡¦¤ ¥£ ¥¤®²±³¸¶¯´³´¹·²·µ¦ª©¡¦¥¡¦¤¢§¥ }pqqcgfRWUFKJ:@>6>;.53     20397ÖÚÙÐÓÒÓÕÔÔÖÕÓÕÔÒÔÓÑÓÒÓÔÔÓÔÔÓÔÔÓÔÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÕÔÒÕÔÒÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÔÔÔÔÔÔÔÓÔÔÔÔÔÔÔÓÔÔÓÔÔÓÔÓÓÕÔÒÔÓÒÔÓÓÕÔÓÖÕÑÔÓÑÔÓÓÖÕÑÔÓÚÝÜÌÏÎ¬¯®dhg  2 2.@HFÕÙ×ÓÒÒÒÔÓËÑÏy~}$''&.,*23$//#/0'((34GQQ½ÅÄÖÛÛÒÔÓÑÓÓÔÕÔÓÓÑÖÖÔÒÒÐÒÔÓÒÔÓÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÔÓÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÑÓÒÓÕÔÒÔÓÑÓÒÔÖÕÒÔÓÓÕÔÒÔÓÓÕÔÏÒÑ½À¿³µ´¨ª©¬®­©«ªÓÕÔÒÓÒÓ×ÖUZY Q\YÀÄÅÖÛÛÓÕÕÓÖÔÓÕÕÓÕÓÓÕÓÒÕÓÑÓÒÔÖÕÑÒÒÕÔÔÔÕÕÔÖÕÑÔÔÒÕÕÍÐÏÍÐÏÑÔÓÓÖÕÒÕÔÓÕÔÔÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÔÓÔÖÕÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÔÓÓÕÔÔÖÕÓÕÔÇÉÈ¸º¹«­¬ª¬««­¬ª¬««­¬«­¬ÂÄÃÒÔÓÐÓÒÓÖÕÒÖÕÔ×ÖÑÔÓÑÕÔÓ×Öhml BB'108JIÃààÀââÀàâÁßâÂàâÀáâ¿áâÁßâÀÞàÃááÁÝÝØïïòÿÿçóóÝèçÓáÞËÞÜ¡¡L U[[$-,0>>ÇàßÁàáÀàãÁàãÂàâÀáâ¿áâÁàâ¿àáÂáãÂààÃáàÄÞÛàðïùÿÿýþüýþÿúþÿúÿÿóûüâïî×ææÍßß­Á¿;KK+*=GG  44 10>OO¶ÍÎÁàá¾àáÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâ¿áãÂßá×êìôþÿýÿþþýûûÿþÝêëÊÛÛìüûéúúÆÝÛÁáâ¾áâÀßâÁááÀáàÂáäÄáàL^]R[Z 0 22zÂàâÀàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÀáâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÀáâ¿áà¿àâÁßáÀßÞÒçåòüüüýüýÿþüÿÿåòðÊÞÜåøøç÷ùÊàâ¿ââ¾ââÁáäÃáãÁÜÜBSSbgh 0.$11nÂàâÀßáÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâÁàâ¾àß¿áâ¾àâÁáàÇàßçöôûÿþýÿþûýûóüùÔåä×êìñÿÿ×çêÀßÝ»àáÀßäÂàâÁÜÜBSSjqqÇÊÉÔÔÔÔÖÕ¶¸·¹»ºÐÒÑÒÔÓÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÒÔÓÓÕÔÔÖÕÖÖÖÐÔÓ^db 074lqpËÏÑÓÖØÐÑÓÖÖ×ÔÖÔ ¢ NRQ 2-*40'.-V\]¡§©×ÚÜÕÕÖÔÕÔÕØÔÆËÇmpm  10"//&56  ºÓÔÄáá¿ÞÞÃââÂàãÀÝáÃßáÉßßåõõöÿþýÿÿüÿýìöõ¢²¯&10±°²ÖÖØÒÕÓÓÓÓÔÔÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÓÕÔÑÓÒÒÔÓÔØ×¸½»*2 164¬°°ª­¬ª¬«¬®­«­¬ª®­GKJprq¼¾½ÖØ×ÒÔÓÓÕÔÖØ×¿ÁÀbdd 99yÇáàÄàßÁàà¾àá¾ßâÁÞßÐääõþþüýýüÿþéöö§§"-+³´¶ÔÖÕÑÔÓÒÔÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÒÔÓÑÓÒÒÔÓÓÕÔÔÙØ6;9 9?=«­¬«­¬«­¬ª­¬«­¬ª­¬¬®­«­¬©«ª§«ª«¯®§«ª?CAÀÅÁÒ×ÓÒ×ÒÑÕÔÒÖÕ­²°JRO 21-32  5;9jon¤¨§¯³²­°¯¬®­ª¬«¬­¬¬­¬«­¬ª¬«¬­¬¬®­ª««¬­¬­­­ª¬«ª¬««­¬«­¬«­¬«­¬ª¬««­¬«««¬¬­¬®­«­¬ª®­ª®­¬±¯¢§¥v}{IRO  0.*0.+1         URJ¯¬£jh\FC700           00.10021021000222444111332666<<<JJIXXXddd||{¡¡£¹¹ºÉÉÊÞÞàéééìììðððòòôùùúÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿüüüüüüýýýþþþÿÿÿýýýäääÀÀÀËËËÇÇÇËËÌÅÅÇÂÂÃÇÇÇÅÅÃÄÄÂÎÎÎÒÒÓªª¨[\Xopk ­¨»·®WTL 2      kiXÉÆ½?A            978-1-4244-5950-6/09/$26.00 ©2009 IEEE 441

RR header format D   A daptations The other main building block of the AdamRTP protocol is the adaptation mechanism AdamRTP provides a number of adaptation mechanisms to enhance QoS and to extend the life time of the WSN Statistical QoS feedback information helps the protocol acquire information about the state of the network then allows it to act accordingly on time using adaptations AdamRTP provides three different adaptation mechanisms 1  Number of flows  the sender adjusts the number of flows dynamically to suite the current WSN state When the receiver detects that a certain active flow is delivering late real-time multimedia packets \(which we consider lost\and number of lost packets is greater than certain threshold , or no packets at all are received the receiver informs the sender about this incident in the next RR. When the sender receives the RR it deletes this flow The sender adds another flow only to maintain a minimum number of flows. Moreover, AdamRTP adds a new flow even if there is no packet loss at all This happens if the network is uncongested, i.e. it adds a new flow if number of flows maximum allowed 2  Rate adjustment  adjusting the sending rate can ease the delivery of packets when the network is facing congestion If the network state is congested and deleting an affected flow does not help alleviating congestion AdamRTP will decrease the sending rate, i.e. decrease media quality, thus decreasing the number of packets used to play this media However, if the network reports no significant congestion according to the value of fraction of lost that each 032\020\037\031\023 /\001 3\020\\033\020 001 6\\035\001 7\020\\033\020 001 2\033\'-\016\r\001 7\020\\033\020 001 2\033\'-\016\r\001 r\#\030\023\\033\001\033\\037 001 978-1-4244-5950-6/09/$26.00 ©2009 IEEE 442 


individual flow is reporting for 3 consecutive RRs A da mRTP increases sending rate up to a threshold 3  Power  AdamRTP checks continuously for cumulative remaining power at each path separately If power is draining fast from a certain path used by a flow, AdamRTP instructs the sender about this incident. The sender sensor in turn, instructs the routing protocol to use different path if possible. Each node along the path adds its own energy level to a field in the header and increments another field that acts as a node\222s counter When the sink receives this packet it divides the total number of energy level over number of node\222s count to get the average of power level for all nodes participating in the process of forwarding the packet from source to destination The receiver sends the average power value to sender in next RR for each flow Our adaptation algorithm, implemented at the sender, checks continuously for RRs that have been issued periodically from the receiver, and examine each flow separately. It calculates the fraction of packets lost for each flow found in the RR received If the loss is less than the minimum threshold MIN_TH it will mark the network as \223GOOD\224. When the receiver receives two RRs stating that network state is good for each individual flow, then rate adjustment adaptation algorithm increments the sending rate by a small value e.g 0.1 until reaching a maximum sending rate threshold MAX_RATE However if the loss is greater than MIN_TH but less than maximum loss threshold MAX_TH it considers the network state as 223ACCEPTABLE\224 Checking if packet loss between MIN_TH and MAX_TH allows the sender not to change the number of flows immediately thus preventing oscillations However if the network loss is greater than MAX_TH the network is marked as \223BAD\224 and actions should be taken. The number of flows is decreased by one But before deleting a flow AdamRTP checks for current active number of flows If number of flows is greater than one, it deletes the affected flow right away But if the number of flows is equal to one AdamRTP doesn\222t delete the affected flow immediately so that we don\222t end up with no active flow at all AdamRTP adds a new flow and instructs the routing protocol to find a new path for the new flow Once successful AdamRTP deletes the affected flow and if the network is still \223BAD\224, the sending rate is decreased until reaching a MIN_RATE III. SIMULATIONS We used the Network Simulator \(NS-2\version ns-2.31. We created a 10 by 10 grid of sensor nodes \(total 100 nodes\ Each node is about 50 meters apart While creating the nodes we assigned both AdamRTP and AdamRTCP agents to every created node in the topology, thus each sensor node can act as a stream generator and a packet forwarder when necessary Some terms need to be clarified as follows A healthy Network is a network without any external type of traffic or any node failure A congested network means a network that has an external source of traffic which results in congestion. A network with node failure suffers from some node failure. Node failures take a uniform random probability of nodes to die for a random short duration e.g 2 seconds AdamRTP default packet size is 200 Bytes. The transmission rate that we mostly start our script with is around 65 kbps. This means the sender sends a packet every 24.5 ms Finally each node is initially charged with 1000 J as a source of power Four different types of simulation experiments were conducted The first compares regular RTP behavior with AdamRTP. The second experiment compares single-flow with multi-flows performance The third experiment compares AdamRTP with and without adaptations Finally performance of AdamRTP in terms of energy consumption is evaluated A  RTP vs. AdamRTP We sent 1000 packets over the same healthy network, once using RTP and once using AdamRTP. Firstly, we calculated the average remaining power for the whole WSN as depicted in Table 1 which shows that AdamRTP consumed less power than RTP  AdamRTP consumed 6.77J 1000J 226 993.23J while RTP consumed 18.18J on average Table 1  Remaining power comparison between RTP and AdamRTP   RTP  AdamRTP with 5 flows Minimum Node Power \(J 9 7 2.02 985.06 Average Node Power \(J 9 8 1.82 993.23   F i g. 5. Bandwidth of AdamRTP vs. RTP with temporary node failure Moreover, we instructed one node to fail for some time at a specific point of time in both scenarios then calculated the bandwidth \(see Fig. 5\ In Fig. 5 a node in the path between the sender and the receiver died at the 8 th  second for about 1 second. AdamRTP was able to send packets using other flows Only one flow was affected by the node failure, while in RTP it took some time to discover the failure before the routing protocol acts upon this and rediscover another path to avoid the path that it is currently using which contains the dead node B  AdamRTP single-flow vs. AdamRTP multi-flows The sender sends a stream of packets over a congested network where we randomly add failing nodes and external sources of traffic \(one source of external traffic at a time Table 2 shows statistical results regarding the number of packets received when running the AdamRTP script using oneflow and three concurrent flows respectively for 100 times each. When using 3-flows, AdamRTP performs better in terms of the number of packets received Note that the minimum 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 90000 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 Bandwidth \(bits/second Time \(seconds Bandwidth of AdamRTP vs. RTP RTP AdamRTP 978-1-4244-5950-6/09/$26.00 ©2009 IEEE 443 


number of packets received when sending 3-flows is higher than the minimum in 1-flow. This clearly indicates that multiflows is capable of delivering more packets even in worst case scenario, e.g. congestion 016\\(\030\020\001\004\b\001\001\r\\035/\020\037\021\001 \020\035\020\022$\020\033\001\021\037\\037\022\021\037\022\035\021\001\0230\0012\033\'-\016\r\001\036\021\022\024"\001\023\024\02040\030\023\031\001$\021\b\001\0373 \020\02040\030\023\031\021    u sing 1 flow using 3 flows Mean 2292 2380 Standard Error 13.26 11.59 Median 2279 2390 Mode 2409 2472 Standard Deviation 133 116 Minimum 1980 2057 Maximum 2516 2631 95% Confidence Interval 2292\26126 2380\26123 To test whether the data indicates differences between the two scenarios in terms of the number of packets received we conducted an independent two-sample t-test The mean and standard deviation of the total number of packets received in the multi-flows scenario were 2380 and 116 respectively whereas in the single-flow scenario, these quantities were 2292 and 133 respectively Since the standard deviations are comparable we used two-sample t-test assuming equal variances. The statistical value obtained was 4.954754, which when compared to a t-distribution with 198 degrees of freedom gives a one-sided p-value of 7.75x10 7  Thus the average n u mber of packets received by the multi-flows is significantly higher than single-flow Fig 6 shows that the performance improves when the number of flows increases, i.e. when used with adaptations b\001  Fig. 6. Comparison of AdamRTP using a single-flow and multi-flows over a c o ngested network with node failure C  Effect of Adaptation on AdamRTP  F ig. 7. AdamRTP adaptation vs. no adaptation The adaptation techniques in AdamRTP provide flexible r e actions to frequent changes in the WSN Fig 7 shows the average number of packets received when comparing AdamRTP with and without the use of Adaptation. AdamRTP with multi-flows and adaptation overcomes all other methods D  Energy consumption  Initially, each node in the network is configured with 1000J as a source of power. When a node wants to transmit a packet it consumes twice the amount of power compared to receiving a packet. As a result, with nodes having limited source of power a WSN is able to send a little more when using multi-flows compared to single flow. That is to say, each intermediate node in the multi-flows scenario sends fewer packets thus saving more power per intermediate node Table 3. Remaining power comparison between single and multi-flows  S i ngle-Flow Multi-Flows \(5-flows Node\222s Minimum Power \(J 983.67 985.75 Average Power \(J 992.68 993.31 Table 3 shows a comparison of the minimum power remaining among all sensors and the average remaining power for the whole WSN when sending 1000 packets over a healthy network in single and multi flows scenarios We choose a healthy network as in a network with node failure, if packet loss occurs on the path to receiver due to node failure the remaining sensor nodes on the path will not send any packet. Thus, they consume no power, which is not a fair comparison with a situation where we have more node failures Table 4.

Because AdamRTP is able to distribute the traffic load over more sensors, so each intermediate sensor in case of multi-flows sends fewer packets compared to a single-flow scenario thus saving more power per node i.e nodes with limited sources of power do not die quickly Consequently, the lifetime of the WSN is extended IV.

In this section, MRTP is discussed The Multi-flow Real-time Transport Protocol for ad hoc networks   MRTP i s  a  t ra n s po rt  p r o t o c o l  a n d i s  de s i gn e d  to allow applications to send real-time data over ad hoc networks. It uses an MDC encoder to split a stream of data into several flows then sends each flow on a separate path The MRTP protocol is a session-oriented protocol This means a session needs to be established prior to any data transmission A three-way handshaking is initiated from the source node sender/receiver using HelloSession  and ACKHelloSession  messages This gives both parties an opportunity to agree on some parameters such as number of flows to be used During the session, some flows may be unavailable, due to node failure or severe congestion In this case the receiver sends a DeleteFlow message to the sender. The sender in return deletes the affected flow and redistributes the assigned remaining packets to other active flows When a new path is found the routing protocol informs MRTP about this new path Accordingly a new flow can be added to the session by initiating an AddFlow message. MRTP generates periodic QoS reports using Sender Reports and Receiver Reports that carry both per-flow and per-session statistics When packets of different flows arrive at the destination the receiver stores these packets in a buffer for reordering \(according to sequence number and timestamp in header AdamRTP looks similar to the MRTP However MRTP is designed for ad hoc networks, not WSNs, and a WSN has extra new requirements that any new protocol should consider Furthermore MRTP is a session-oriented protocol but we believe in multimedia streaming this is not necessary Finally MRTP does not consider power consumption at all V. CONCLUSION Real-time multimedia applications are resource hungry They require more computational and storage capabilities than traditional network applications In addition they need more bandwidth for transmission Running this type of applications over WSNs which suffer from computational memory and power constrains is challenging Our goal is to send real-time multimedia over WSNs while achieving good QoS and extending the lifetime of the network WSNs are usually densely deployed This creates many paths between any two sensors. We can utilize this feature and divide a large multimedia file into smaller portions then send each small portion over a separate path i.e instead of transferring the multimedia stream using few nodes many intermediate nodes are involved We propose the Adaptive Multi-flows Real-time Multimedia Transport Protocol for WSNs AdamRTP which divides one multimedia stream into multiple flows then sends each flow over a separate path if possible to the destination Compared to a single-flow scenario each intermediate node in the multi-flows scenario sends fewer packets thus saving more power per node In addition AdamRTP employs some adaptation techniques that act like congestion control We assume that each sensor has a fair size of internal cache In the future we hope that WSNs with multimedia capabilities a r e  w i de l y  de pl oy e d   Our simulation results show that AdamRTP enhances the delivery especially when the WSN is suffering from congestion due to node failure or external source of traffic Also, it is able to reduce the power consumption per node and deliver more packets if the nodes have limited power source thus extending the lifetime of the WSN REFERENCES 1 G o y a l   V   K   2 0 0 1   M u l t i p l e  D e s c ri p t i o n  C o d i n g   C o m p r e s s i o n  M e e t s  t h e  Network.

In-water tests have demonstrated the viability of the MARTA architecture as instan tiated in TAOSF One of our key next steps is an extended end-to-end test in which multiple OASIS platforms map a rhodamine-dye HAB surrogate under human telesupervision. Over the next year we plan to increase the number of platforms, develop and deploy adaptive sensing algorithms, and continue deploying the TAOSF system in the Chesapeake Bay estuary Because of their in-situ observation capabilities and resolution, as well as their adaptivity, telesupervised autonomous surface vehicles are crucial to the sensor web for Earth science. The MARTA telesupervision architecture underlying TAOSF is broadly applicable to a wide variety of domains beyond HABs, incl uding ecological forecasting water management, carbon management, disaster management, coastal management, homeland security, and planetary exploration A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work was supported by NASA award NNX06AF27G Telesupervised Adaptive Ocean Sensor Fleet, granted under the Advanced Information Systems Technology program of NASAs Earth Systems Technology Office ESTO\he TAOSF project is a collaboration among Carnegie Mellon University CMU Flight Center \(GSFC\, NASA Goddards Wallops Flight Facility \(WFF\mergent Space Technologies, Inc. \(EST and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\ifornia Institute of Technology.

The second state describes the need to impose any operational restrictions which are mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Hence No means no operational restrictions while a Yes means that some operational restrictions are necessary Finally the third state describes whether some emergency or abnormal operation is applied which is mandated by procedures or by pilot decision Here Yes means that emergency or abnormal operation must be applied while No means that an emergency or abnormal procedure is not necessary Both criteria are related to the failure and function characteristics which are given as input to the ETA One presumption is that only failure effects with possible operational or economic consequences according to MSG-3 should be included in the analysis The failure characteristics also include the rate of occurrence which will affect the outcome of the analysis The characteristics of the failure will also advice whether the occurrence of failure will be recognized by the crew or not As standard design practice if the failure has any operational consequences it should be evident to the crew The combination of different events Yes or No within the states of the two criteria operational phase and operating capability will create different scenarios that in turn will determine the ultimate operational consequences Based on the possible combination of events 25 different scenarios were identified which will lead to the following classification of consequences no operational consequence airborne and/or ground delays and emergency or abnormal operation Out of the 25 different scenarios that were identified there are six scenarios with no operational consequences One of these scenarios is when the failure never occurs i.e scenario 25 The other five scenarios where no operational consequences occur are where the failure's associated maintenance is deferrable and there are no necessary operational or abnormal restrictions i.e scenarios 2 6 11 16 and 21 Hence the only difference between these five scenarios is the operational phase where the failure occurs There are 14 event scenarios where the consequences are some sort of delay i.e scenarios 1 3 4 5 8 9 10 13 14 15 18 19 20 and 24 Out of these there are five scenarios where the operational consequences are manifested as only airborne delay i.e scenarios 1 5 10 15 and 20 These scenarios are related to the occurrence of a failure that is related to deferrable items but that requires some operational restrictions Abnormal procedures contribute to operational consequences in scenarios 7 12 17 and 22 All these scenarios are related to failures with non-deferrable items that have some sort of operational restrictions and necessitates emergency and abnormal procedures by the flight crew The main difference between the scenarios is the phase of flight where the failure occurs In scenarios 7 and 12 the failure occurs prior to dispatch or during takeoff respectively The two scenarios 17 failure occurs during cruise and 22 failure occurs during approach and landing result in diversion Also there are situations such as scenario 23 in which the aircraft is in landing mode and the occurrence of a sudden failure in some systems may reduce the capability of the aircraft to complete the landing mission Hence the pilot may perform a touch and go 8 ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED ETA In order to illustrate the proposed ETA and to demonstrate the application of the constructed event tree an Avionic Ventilation System AVS of a hypothetical twin-engine single aisle aircraft has been selected The associated data were gathered from particular airlines and then altered for confidentiality reasons to represent typical scenarios Avionic Ventilation System A VS The AVS is used to cool different avionics equipment AVS comprises different components such as computer blower extract fan sensors filter and valves One of the most important functions of the AVS computer is to control the AVS system's valves to open and close and fans to turn on or off The skin air inlet valve is installed in the fuselage skin to provide an outdoor air supply gateway for AVS on the ground see Figure 5 Figure 5 on the ground the valve is 10 _10 Fan Skin air inlet valve schematic diagram This valve is electrically operated but i Filter Air flow Valve can be manually overridden When the aircraft is 


fully open and in flight the valve is fully closed One of the functional failures which might occur with an AVS system could be defined as Skin Air Inlet Valve fails to close at take-off power setting Taking off with the Skin Air Inlet valve open instead of closed damages the avionics ventilation ducts and may have potential effects on both cabin pressurization and degradation of avionics ventilation performance If the valve is not function properly at take-off power setting prior to take-off a warning message appears on the cockpit display unit so that cockpit crew will be aware of the fault prior to take-off Therefore the conditional probability of detection of failure prior to take-off is 100 see Figure 6 This failure has no catastrophic or safety effect on the aircraft and its occupants However in order to avoid associated effect on cabin pressurization issues and to protect damage to the system the MEL advises that the valve should be closed manually on the ground and the related electrical connection should be isolated This is an immediate action which is required to fly with an inoperative Skin Air Inlet Valve within a certain limited time without any operational restrictions see Figure 6 Therefore the aircraft has to be returned to the ramp/gate so that the maintenance crew can perform these actions before further dispatch Hence this failure is classified as an evident failure with operational effect Based on the proposed ETA the only possible scenario is number 4 which results in the operational consequence Ground delay at departure see Figure 6 In order to quantify the rate at which operational consequences occur the frequency of failure failure rate or intensity should be multiplied by both the conditional probability of occurrence of this failure in different operational phases states 1.1 to 1.5 and the conditional probability of adverse affect of the failure on the operation capability states 2.1 to 2.3 This may be expressed as in Equation 1 The failure rate of Skin air inlet valve fails to close at take-N 1 2 3 4 S inariret vaKefailstD dcs 1 2 1 iec.lity  eah phaseofflight 1.4 Cuse 15 lArcax h  Ii adrg 2 Efedof failueon opering apability 2.1 Ddab 22 23 1 p e U6rng aFerabcn abromni restricicrn prcecdre Ria ID Takedfl 0imb takeoff Yeslow_ 260\260\260 Oocunof failure during 0 ca 0 a 0 Oper.iornl Cancieia m Ar1xmeclde I Nbcperaicnnipat I A rbcrnecblay Grardcalja 4 daeLre I G I_dddajdt"I I Figure 6 Proposed ETA of the hypothetical AVS system K Annual cost of scenario per aircraft Aircraft/year Rate of occurrence of each operational consequence scenario K Rate of occurrencj of scenario per FH Failure rate X Unit cost of ground delay al departure per FH x Conditional probability of states in criteria 1 x Conditional probability of states in criteria 2 t Duration Average annua2 X of delay X utilization X J 0 J 0 FH/yearJ 2 Quantity Per Aircraft QPA 2 11 11 1.2 1.3 


off power setting is 1 12e-5 per Flight Hour FH based on historical data The conditional probability of states in criteria 1 prior to take-off is estimated to 100 as the failure will be evident to the crew prior to take-off The conditional probability of states in criteria 2 nondeferrable with no operational restriction is estimated to 100 as the failure is not deferrable and it does not impose any operational restrictions as the aircraft is not allowed to take-off with the failure present according to the MEL Hence the rate of occurrence of scenario number 4 for AVS is 1.12e 5 per FH X 100 X I100  1.12e 5 per FH The outcome of the ETA on the hypothetical AVS system and the applicable values for each probability which has been gathered from historical data and expert opinions is shown in Figure 6 In order to estimate the cost of associated consequences standard average cost can be used for different operational consequences which normally are provided by the manufacturer or airlines For this specific case i.e scenario number 4 the assumptions made are displayed in Table 1 as advised by experienced practitioners Table 1 Cost Figures of some Type of Operational Consequences Consequences Magnitude Cost Long more than 30 min 70 min Ground delay Short less than 30 min 30 min Long more than 30 min 58 min Airborne delay Short less than 30 min 28 min The annual total cost for each consequence scenario for whole aircraft could be estimated in accordance with Equation 2 Hence the annual cost of scenario number 4 considering 3,000 FH of utilization per year is estimated to 1.12e per FH x 60 min/60 lhr delay time x 70 min x 60 min  420 hr x 3,000 FH year x QPA 1 The proposed methodology could also be adapted as a support for cost-effectiveness analysis of candidate maintenance tasks during the development of aircraft maintenance programs However the analysis documentation also constitutes an important part of the knowledge base which is also useful for design operation and maintenance of the aircraft In order to implement the proposed methodology and achieve valuable results accurate and sufficient data and information are needed as input data for the analysis This information is related to the technical system and its reliability e.g failure modes and their frequency of occurrence and maintainability performances e.g Built-in Test Equipment modularization and Line Replaceable Units Other information that is needed is related to aircraft operation and associated procedures given in formal documents such as the MEL FM FCOM and QRH Also information about the maintenance support performance is necessary The operational consequences and the probabilities of different events included in the proposed event tree can be quantified by the aid of historical data or expert judgments However an exact quantification and assessment of the cost of operational consequences of failures is a challenge due to a long list of influencing factors and inadequacy of required information One example is the challenge to determine a good estimation of the failure rate which requires the collection of data from the world fleet This collection of data is difficult since removal data do not necessarily imply a failure or since subsequent test level has difficulties to duplicate test results achieved at preceding test levels i.e no fault found events Another reason is that even if there is a failure it is not always possible to link the reported failure to the functional failure or failure mode identified in the MSG-3 analysis When there is a lack of historical data expert judgments can be a good source of information To support an effective extraction of the field experts knowledge there are systematic methodologies available e.g pair wise comparison 14.14 aircraft/year 9 DISCUSSION The scenario descriptions using the event trees give a detailed picture of the possible operational consequences of different failures in aircraft system during operation Hence the proposed methodology is considered as a valuable support in the assessment of the operational consequences of failures 12
