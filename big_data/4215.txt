Person Tracking-by-Detection with Ef\002cient Selection of Part-Detectors Arne Schumann Martin B 250 auml Rainer Stiefelhagen Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Institute for Anthropomatics 76131 Karlsruhe f arne.schumann baeuml rainer.stiefelhagen g kit.edu Abstract In this paper we introduce a new person tracking-bydetection approach based on a particle 002lter We leverage detection and appearance cues and apply explicit occlusion reasoning The approach samples ef\002ciently from a large set of available person part-detectors in order to increase runtime performance while retaining accuracy The tracking approach is evaluated and compared to the state of the art on the CAVIAR surveillance dataset as well as on a multimedia dataset consisting of six episodes of the TV series The Big Bang Theory The results demonstrate the versatility of the approach on very different types of data and its robustness to camera movement and non-pedestrian body poses 1 Introduction Person tracking has gained a lot of interest over the last years  1  6  4  10  11  The focus usually lies on pedestrian tracking for example in the context of safety  security within camera networks or in cars to increase pedestrian safety In such scenarios people are assumed to be in an upright pose which simpli\002es both detection and tracking On the other hand there are vast amounts of data which do not ful\002ll these conditions for example multimedia data such as movies and TV series as well as personal videos or videos on social media sites In such data non-upright poses are much more prevalent and occlusions are very common for example in close-up shots where only the upper body of a person is visible In this paper we present a part-based tracking approach that works equally well in different scenarios We use the poselet detector  3  as our underlying detector due to its 003exibility and robustness over a wide range of human poses However one of the main problems of the poselet detector is its high computational demand We therefore propose a dynamic part selection method with the goal of signi\002cantly speeding up the detection procedure by reducing the number of poselets which have to be evaluated each frame We evaluate our approach on two very different data Figure 1 Tracks on The Big Bang Theory  The part-based approach can deal with partly occluded persons and persons in nonpedestrian poses  e.g  sitting sets 1 The CAVIAR dataset which consists of typical surveillance-type data and 2 the 002rst 6 episodes of the TV series The Big Bang Theory  We will show in our experiments that the proposed tracking approach is suited for both of these very different scenarios Further we will show signi\002cant speed-ups with our proposed dynamic part selection technique while maintaining a strong level of tracking accuracy An exemplary tracking result is depicted in Fig 1  The paper is structured as follows We 002rst give an overview over related work in Sec 1.1  and brie\003y summarize the underlying poselet detector in Sec 2  In Sec 3  we describe the proposed tracking approach and extend it by a dynamic way to select detectors in Sec 4  Finally we present experimental results in Sec 5  1.1 Related Work One key component for person tracking is to reliably locate persons in an image i.e  person detection  The stateof-the art person tracking methods all rely on an underlying person detector not only to initialize tracks but also to continually evaluate the presence of a person while tracking which coined the term tracking-by-detection  1  Dif ferent 2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Bas\ed Surveillance 978-1-4799-0703-8/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 43 


person detectors have been proposed to be used as underlying detector for example based on pictorial structures with discriminative part detectors  1  Edgelet-based part detectors  6  the Implicit Shape Model  8  4  or a Histograms of Oriented Gradients HOG detector  4  W e e xplore the poselet detector  3  as underlying detector  which can by construction deal with a wide range of poses Unlike previous work we explicitly take into account the computational demand of the detector and propose a dynamic subsampling technique of the parts depending on the track history see Sec 4.1  as well as for track initialization see Sec 4.2  In order to connect detections to tracks many recent approaches 002rst detect all possible person locations globally in all frames and then associate them 002rst to short and reliable tracklets then to longer tracks  6  10  11  Such associationbased tracking turns out to be robust against occlusions and mismatches however it requires knowledge of all frames in advance and therefore is only suitable in of\003ine settings This is a strong requirement which cannot always be met for example for real-time tracking in a camera network In order to perform online-tracking a popular choice is to employ a particle 002lter  4  Since we do not w ant to restrict ourselves to of\003ine settings we employ a particle 002lter as well in this paper However in contrast to  4  we not only use it for the purpose of tracking but also as a means to restrict the number of required evaluations of the detector in order to improve runtime see Sec 3.1  2 Person Detection For person detection we build on the part-based poselet approach by Bourdev et al   3  A poselet part detector is a HOG feature-based linear support vector machine classi\002er Training data for a speci\002c part is selected by the actual underlying 3D-pose of the person in the selected partial view of the training image As such parts which might be visually similar but do not stem from the same pose will not end up in the same part classi\002er Part detectors can actually be for very speci\002c poses e.g  a 223right arm crossing a torso\224 Each poselet detection casts a vote towards the full bounding box of the person These votes are clustered and con\002dence-thresholded before being accepted as 002nal person detections We employ a set of more than 1000 poselet part detectors 1  The large number of body part detectors results in a good robustness to partial occlusions pose and orientation variation but of course results in a high computational cost which is roughly linear to the number of parts 3 Tracking Approach In our tracking approach we apply a particle 002lter in combination with poselet detector as follows For a new 1 We use the pre-trained models from http://www.cs.berkeley.edu 030 lbourdev/poselets track see Sec 3.4  a random set of particles is initialized with uniform weights In each time step particles are propagated through a system model into a new state Each particle's state is evaluated by an observation model which updates the particle weights accordingly For the next timestep a new set of particles is sampled from the old set according to their weights For further details on particle 002ltering please refer to  7  State We model a track i at time t with a threedimensional state containing the location within the image as well as a scale value that represents the size of the track state i t   x i t  y i t  s i t    1 The scale value is related to the size of a person detection through s i t  w i t w base with the width of the track's person hypothesis w i t and the base width of the person detector w base  Propagation A simple noise-based motion model is used for particle propagation  x i t  y i t    x i t 000 1   loc  y i t 000 1   loc  2 s i t  s i t 000 1   scale 3 with noise terms  loc and  scale which are randomly drawn from zero mean Gaussian distributions N loc 0  033 2 loc   N scale 0  033 2 scale   While 033 scale is a 002xed parameter over the course of a sequence the standard deviation for the location within the image is individual to each track and computed as 033 loc  033 loc base 003 f  s i t 000 1   This follows the intuition that larger person detections are closer to the camera and their movements have a greater effect in terms of image coordinates We explicitly do not use a velocity-based motion model results in order to increase robustness in cases where a tracked object abruptly changes direction Note that these changes in track direction can also be caused by camera movement when the camera is not 002xed as is often the case in multimedia data We use two observation models for scoring the particles in order to include both evidence from the detector and appearance cues into each particle's weight 3.1 Detector Observation Model The detector observation model updates the weight w i j of the j th particle of track i based on poselet detection scores Given a particle state and a poselet detector one can compute the expected location of a potential positive poselet response A poselet detection  x pl  y pl  w pl  h pl  with votes  v x  v y  v w  v h  and scale s pl  w pl votes for a person detection  x ps  y ps  w ps  h ps    x pl  v x s pl  y pl  v y s pl  v w s pl  v h s pl   In reverse 226 starting from the person 44 


detection 226 we can compute the location of an expected corresponding poselet detection as s pl  w ps v w 4  x pl  y pl  w pl  h pl    x ps 000 v x s pl y ps 000 v y s pl  w ps v w  h ps v h   5 In this way we can determine the position of a potential contributing part-detection which is faster than scanning a bigger area around the current track position with all part detectors and does not sacri\002ce much accuracy The poselet detector is then evaluated at that location and the resulting poselet scores d k contribute to the particle weight wd i j   detectors X k 0 f  d k   f  d k   032 d k d k  0 0 else 6 While in many cases parts of the features can be shared among particles and need not be recomputed the large number of detectors makes this particle scoring computationally expensive On the other hand leaving out the wrong part detectors may lead to low particle weights and inadvertent termination of tracks We describe an approach to handle this situation in Sec 4  3.2 Appearance Observation Model In addition to the detector observation model we use an color-based appearance model Appearance information is complementary to the detections and can keep a track alive if for some reason the detector fails but the person is still visible It also helps to terminate tracks more quickly if a person disappears but background clutter causes part detectors to still support some particles We model the appearance of a track through an RGB color histogram Histograms are computed for each particle H i j and matched against that of the track H i to compute the particle weight wa i j  1 000 D B  H i  H i j   7 D B is the Bhattacharyya distance Particle histograms are computed over an area  x y w h   0  33  0  2  0  33  0  3 of each particle's bounding box in order to primarily capture upper body clothing colors The 002nal weight of a particle j of track i is then determined as a weighted sum w i j  wd i j  013 003 1  f  003 wa i j 8 f  max t k 6  t i area t i  area t k area t i  area t k  9 with a 002xed weight 013 that determines the in\003uence of appearance on the track The appearance is also weighted by the maximum degree that track t i overlaps with other tracks This ensures that the in\003uence of appearance on particle evaluation increases when tracks start to overlap and their detection con\002dence becomes a less reliable information Taking into account the observation models scores a 002nal track hypothesis for the current timestep is computed as the weighted average of all particle states The track's appearance histogram is then updated using the new track hypothesis 3.3 Occlusion Handling Occlusions can be detected by determining when two tracks t 1 and t 2 start to overlap Once such a situation occurs it must be determined which of the overlapping tracks is the one that gets occluded We use two cues to make this determination the difference in scale and changes in appearance We compute an occlusion term occ  t 1  t 2   d app  t 1  d app  t 2  001 r s t 2 s t 1  10 with the difference d app  t 1   j app  t 1  000 app avg  t 1  j between the current appearance of a track app  t 1  and its average appearance over the recent past app avg  t 1  and the scale s t 1 of a track A value occ  t 1  t 2  025 1 hints towards either the scale of track t 1 being smaller than that of t 2  the appearance change in track t 1 being more signi\002cant or both Consequently we assume track t 1 to be occluded for occ  t 1  t 2  025 1 and t 2 otherwise A weight r is used to bias this decision towards the scale or appearance cue In our implementation we set r to 1 Once a track is considered occluded its motion model is switched from a noise-based propagation to velocity-based propagation We use velocity in cases of occlusion in order to increase the chance of picking the track up correctly once it reappears Unless the occluding track has similar size and appearance the occluded track's particles receive only small weights A track becomes un-occluded once its bounding box no longer overlaps with the occluding track and its particle weights recover Tracks that remain occluded for more than three seconds are terminated While a track is occluded its appearance does not get updated 3.4 Track Initialization and Termination Without assuming any prior knowledge about the scene and especially in the case of non-stationary cameras new persons can appear anywhere within the image This is in contrast to other approaches where entryand exit-zones of the scene are explicitly modelled  e.g   6  Accordingly we scan the entire image in regular time intervals for new tracks New detections d n are matched against existing tracks and disregarded if any of the following is true 45 


max track t i area t i  area d n area t i  area d n 025 thr match or 11 9 t i  area t i  area d n  area t i  12 The second case is based on the observation that new persons cannot 002rst appear in full occlusion If a remaining detection has a high score a track is created from it If its score is too low but more detections are found in the same area over multiple consecutive timesteps their scores are accumulated When this accumulated score becomes high enough a new track is created as well In our implementation we require detections accumulate a score of at least thr score over a maximum of 002ve frames The score threshold depends on the detection scale s d and is set to thr score  50 d s  Note that poselet person detection scores are computed as the sum of all contributing poselet scores Therefore high score values are common Tracks are terminated if they either leave the image area or do not get suf\002cient support from their observation models over a period of one second 4 Dynamic Part Sub-Selection We propose a dynamic approach to reduce the number of part-detectors required in the observation model and during track initialization 4.1 Track\255speci\002c Part Selection In order to speed up the particle evaluation in the observation model while retaining the important detectors and thus the tracking accuracy we keep an individual set of detectors with each track The set is divided into two sub-sets a core set and a dynamic set  The core set is meant to contain detectors that are expected to have high relevance for the track The detectors in the dynamic set are randomly selected at each timestep from those that are not in the current core set That way we ensure that each available detector is used every once in a while For each detector d k  we keep the number of times c u k it was used A second value c h k denotes the 223usefulness\224 of the detector for the current track This usefulness is determined as the sum of scores of all detections that supported particles of the track The ratio r h k  c h k c u k is the relative usefulness of the detector Each time the observation model evaluates a track's particles the core set is 002rst 002lled with those detectors that have the highest r h k  The dynamic set is then 002lled with a random selection of the remaining detectors r h k is computed over a recent history of the track to prevent detectors that were initially supporting the track strongly but do not any more from remaining in the core set for too long The number of frames in the history is set to correspond to two seconds of video Figure 2 The detectors of the core subset hits in yellow provide stronger hits than those of the dynamic subset hits in magenta Higher detection scores correspond to a larger radius Using this dynamic detector management runtime performance can be increased while the bene\002ts of a large number of part detectors remain intact This approach works well together with the pose-based nature of the poselet detectors A standing person may be well detected by a pedestrian poselet and as the person sits down it may go through a range of poselets that correspond to the current body pose In this way the detector core set gathers knowledge speci\002c to the track it belongs to represented by the types of poselets it contains Fig  2  depicts detector hits from the core and the dynamic subset In a sitting and occluded position the core subset mostly contains detectors that focus on the face but for a standing person a much wider range of detectors is in the core set Note that this approach to select from a larger detector pool could also be used in combination with holistic person detectors that may be trained for different angles or viewpoints 4.2 Part Selection for Initialization The track initialization step can also be sped up signi\002cantly by using a subset of detectors Starting from a random selection of detectors the set is regularly repopulated by those detectors that performed best in the past Detectors are considered to perform well if they contributed to detections that lead to new tracks being created or caused detections that matched existing tracks The set of part detectors that lead to a new track initialization is used as an initialization of the new track's core subset see Sec 4.1  While the track detector subsets contain information speci\002c to each track the initialization detector subset gathers global information about the scene In this way we are able to leverage track speci\002c information and scene speci\002c information using the same approach without having to make any prior assumptions 46 


5 Experimental Results 5.1 Datasets We evaluate our approach on two datasets The CAVIAR dataset 2 consists of surveillance videos captured by a static camera in a corridor of a shopping mall This dataset has a very low resolution 384 002 288 and contains several scenes with occlusions We created a modi\002ed set of groundtruth annotations where we 002xed some annotation oddities such as person bounding boxes that only surround the foot of a person if the rest is occluded We will make this corrected groundtruth available online 3  In order to provide comparability with previous work we report results on both the original and the corrected groundtruth We further evaluate on a dataset consisting of the 002rst 6 episodes of the TV show The Big Bang Theory BBT This multimedia dataset has a higher resolution of 1024 002 576 moving cameras many different angles non-pedestrianlike poses  e.g  sitting inter-object occlusions and persons are frequently only partially visible because they are cut off by the camera Each episode is about 20 minutes in length and contains around 30  000 frames We labelled every 10th frame as groundtruth 5.2 Evaluation Methodology We use Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy MOTA  2  as evaluation metric M OT A  1 000 P t M ISS t  F P t  M M t P t GT T 13 where M ISS t is the number track misses F P t the number of false positive tracks M M t the number of track switches mismatches and GT t the number of groundtruth tracks at time t  For the CAVIAR dataset we report the average MOTA over all sequences and for the BBT dataset the average MOTA over all cuts of an episode 5.3 Results For our experiments on both datasets we chose a 002xed number of 100 particles We set the base value for propagation in location 033 loc base to 1 The larger person sizes in the BBT dataset adjust this value automatically Unless otherwise speci\002ed we use all available part detectors in our experiments CAVIAR On the CAVIAR dataset our approach achieves a MOTA of 60 On the modi\002ed groundtruth the number of false positive tracks and track misses decrease slightly In Table  1  we compare our performance to one of the best results on the dataset by Huang et al   6  who achie v ed 80 2 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CAVIARDATA1 3 http://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/projects/pri Huang et al  6  Ours Ours MGT MOTA 80.00 60.26 61.32 Misses 20.00 34.22 32.58 FP rate 0.025 0.198 0.192 Table 1 Results on the CAVIAR dataset on original and modi\002ed ground truth MGT compared to a state of the art approach that uses additional scene information accuracy Note that their approach is not directly comparable to ours because it relies on automatically determined scene knowledge such as a groundplane and information about entry-exit zones We chose not to use such information because our approach is intended to work even on data with moving cameras where groundplanes and entryexit zones cannot be automatically determined Another difference that factors into the comparison of the two results is that while Huang et al  optimize their trajectories over the entire length of a scene our approach is an online approach and does not require global knowledge of all frames Lastly experiments show that we loose most accuracy in those sequences where many very small persons appear and stay in the background In these cases the part-based person detector generates few low-score detections that do not allow for reliable track initialization The Big Bang Theory dataset On the Big Bang Theory dataset we compare our approach to our own implementation of an association-based tracker  9  which is similar in approach to  6  Our online approach achie v es a higher accuracy due to a lower number of mismatches which can be explained by our use of an appearance model Results are shown in Table 2  Both tracking approaches used the same set of detections Dynamic Part Selection In order to evaluate the effect of the detector part selection we run our approach with different subset sizes on both datasets The results are depicted in Fig 3  The subset size in the plots refers to the entire detector subset which we split evenly into core and dynamic set When using detector subsets only for the track observation model we observe a moderate overall speedup at a small cost in accuracy The speedup gained during the particle weighting gets masked by the more cost intensive person detection during the track initialization step which takes about 10 seconds per image The tracking time is the same on both datasets because input images are scaled to a uniform size before tracking Using all available detectors the track weighting initially takes approximately 410ms per track Using a subset of 600 detectors scoring time is reduced to 230ms and with 200 detectors the required time lies below 100ms This corresponds to a speedup of 4.2 for the track scoring step The loss in MOTA is caused by a larger number of misses which 47

     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identication method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi trafc does not reect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
