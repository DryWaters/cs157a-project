The spiral propulsion relation between the modern logistics and the city economy represents the characteristics of the cooperating development. In this essay the inner coupling mechanism and stages of the city logistics and economic development will firstly be discussed., It is then followed by the analysis the order parameter of the Coupling of the city economy and the logistics and evaluation analysis model and methods of the coupling of the city economy and logistics based on the artificial neural network. The data using in the an 
alysis was taken from a certain big city in China. At the end of the paper, the suggestions of some possible solutions to improve the coupling of the city logistics and the economic are given suggested according to the research. Finally a brief conclusion will be given at the end in the text Key Words Coupling, Artificial Neural Network, Logistics I  INTRODUCTION With the fast development of Chinese Economy and the improvement of economic structure, its domestic logistics industry develops rapidly  at the same time. The requirement emphasis of the Logistic under current Chinese economy situation is switching from largely focused on quantity to 
qualityof domestic economy is converting from the quantity to the quality. The modern logistics can lower the economy operating cost, promote the economic operating quality, carry out the economize growth mode, and guarantee the sustainable development of economy The development of modern logistics in China is severely imbalanced. The modern logistics industry is highly developed in the eastern coastal region, which has become the cornerstone industry in Zhujiang Delta such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and it is also advanced in Changjiang Delta such as Shanghai and Suzhou. The modern logistics industry mutual re 
lated and the local economy development are closely inter-correlated and promoted with the local econo my  The logistics industry is still unenlightened in lots of cities in the western region of China, with still applying the traditional logistic model, so it which is not well balanced between the economy and the logistics It is important to do a research of the coupling mechanism between urban economy and logistics, in order to find out their intrinsic relation between demand and supply, make sure the coupling degree with each other, as well as put forward the method to improve the coupling degree. The research plays a significant role in promoting the development of

Coupling & coupling relationship Coupling original as a concept of physical, it means the influence phenomena was brought by two \(more than two systems or movements interaction effect, for example the two poles of amplifier, signal magnify by Resistive and capacitive coupling or transformer coupling; and Mutual inductance between the two coils through magnetic coupling.

can be considered as two different things turn to a system by mutual promotion, restraint, and linked, that means every subsystems have dynamic association relationship based on interdependence, mutual coordination and promotion Coupling relationship describes a relationship of interaction effects among systems and factors, based on coupling. In this paper, influence which was produced by logistics and economy coupling factor was called coupling B  Coupling relationship between city logistics and economy There’s an interaction mechanism between urban logistics and economy. It is a law that modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy, and the existing of the interaction coupling and positive feedback loop is one of the main forms of it. There’re various principal contradictions or different major aspects of the contradiction in every period, which lead to distinct development modes The coupling between the urban logistics and economy is based on the certainty or uncertainty of demand and supply However the effect may change and then several modes appear. The coupling relation follows the rule of their spiral by a cycle turning way. It also emphasizes the “limited balance” of the demand and supply, in order to realize the sequential decision of multi-stage and the synergetic process from out of order to in good order There are three modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy Mode 1: “logistic chasing” mode As the rapid economic growth in the city, the demand for logistics grows at the same time, which the local logistics industry can not be met. So the coupling between urban logistics and economy presents in chasing. The condition of software and hardware for the modern logistics industry should be improved. That means the capacity of transportation and storage facility should be enhanced, as well as the logistic management, in the interest of satisfying the economic need Logistic forerunner” mode The economic development is enslaved to the capacity of transportation facility in those cities where the transportation is underdevelopment or in the harbor cities. A majority of the domestic harbor cities bring in the strategy of booming the city by the port”. That’s a reflection of the logistic forerunner” mode. The logistic facilities, especially the construction of the transportation facilities become the base of the economic development. Logistics industry has been considered to be cornerstone and the forerunner of the whole city Mode 3: “logistics-economy association” mode When the logistic demand and supply can assort with each other and can meet the need of the economic growth, the coupling between the urban logistics and economy present itself mostly in the “logistics-economy association” mode The economic growth calls for the development of logistics in capacity and quality. The logistics industry has to apply itself to the promotion of its quality and the optimization to its structure, together with increasing the capacity, which provides the local economy with favorable environment. The modern logistics industry mutual related and promoted with the local economy By regulating the modes of coupling between urban logistics and economy, the contradictions between demand and supply can be solved by following the alternant evolvement rule, and the strategic target of the economic development can be finally accomplished III  ANALYSIS OF CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATIONSHIP BASED ON SYSTEM DYNAMICS A  Importance of System Dynamics analysis  In System Dynamics, system is made up of cell movements of cell and information; it is entia of structure and function. The basic structure is feedback loop; it is a loop of state of system, velocity and information, these elements corresponding to the three components of system: cell movement and information. According to character of feedback process, it separated into positive feedback and negative feedback. Character of positive feedback is it is able to generate self-reinforcing mechanism, but negative feedback’s is that is able to generate self-inhibition mechanism. Complex system behavior is decided by cross mechanism of positive and negative feedback loop With further development of city logistics and economy logistics plays more and more important role. System dynamics is imported to research of city logistics and economy, the meaning are to analyze and think interaction effect of city logistics and economy by view of system, to examine their relationship on the whole situation and overall perspective, and then to develop potential to improve and make up the shortfall, to coordinated develop city and logistics enterprise B  Coupling relationship of city logistics and economy evaluation system based on system dynamics Decision of subsystem and System indicators factors  City logistics and economy coupling relationship evaluation system was built up to analyze the coupling relationship of city logistics and economy by system dynamics, it concludes two subsystems: subsystem of city logistics supply and subsystem of city economy development coupling model was based on th eoretic of system dynamics showed figure 2-1

The model is composed of three parts; they are efficacy function coupling degree function and BP network prediction model of coupling degree A  Selection of sequence parameter Economy and logistics coupling process is a process

The coupling function of urban logistics and economy shows C n U\(u 1  000y U\(u 2 U\(u 1 u 2  000y U\(u 1  1/2 4 Obviously, the value of the coupling degree is between 0 and 1. when Cn 015 1,the degree of coupling reaches its maximum, systems achieve positive resonance coupling between the internal elements ,then tends to a new ordered structure; when C= 0, the degree of the coupling gets smaller no relations among systems, neither their inside elements The system tends to a development of out-of-order D  BP forecast model of coupling value Artificial neural network has many abilities, such as learning ability, parallel processing capacity, and legend storage capacity. Particularly, the three feed-forward neural network is provided with power of approximation to arbitrary complex nonlinear connection. It shows the dynamic and phased characteristic in the process of the coupling between economy and Logistics, so it is applicable to forecast the situation of the dynamic coupling in the next five years.

Before forecast coupling set up BP model like Figure 3-1,then using data in Table 4-1 to train and simulate BP model, in which economic development needs parameter city logistics supply parameter and coupling for 1998,2001,2004 are used as testing samples, taking part in simulation; the other 7 groups of data are used as training sample, training for BP model According to network forecast BP model, two groups of parameter are used as input variables of BP model; use network was trained to simulate coupling values of evaluation model, Table4-2 shows  T ABLE 4-2 COUPLING AND PARAMETER FORECAST VALUE OF LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY INXUZHOUCITY  Year 2007 2008 2009 Economic development needs parameter 0.2933 0.3172 0.4173 City logistics supply parameter 0.2267 0.2598 0.3596 Coupling degree 0.4968 0.5027 0.5071 Year 2010 2011 Economic development needs parameter 0.5435 0.7572 City logistics supply parameter 0.4098 0.4765 Coupling degree 0.5175 0.5206 Analyze data from Table 4-1and Table4-2, value of coupling between 0.49-0.5, coupling relationship, between logistics and economy is at an intermediate stage, coupling show fluctuation. The fluctuations of coupling show that normal development of logistics and economy is reciprocity When economy develop well, the need of logistics is growing, if supplement of logistics doesn’t satisfy the need coupling fall; if development of logistic keep the balance of need and supplement, coupling rise. Analyze from model, the development model of them is “logistics chasing”. Data from tables show that development rate of economy is faster than logistics, so hardware and software of logistics should be 


improved to be suitable to economic development, and then the balance can be kept To improve the coupling of logistics and economy achieve cooperation between logistics and economy government should play great role in city logistics and economy; city logistics infrastructure should be promoted vigorously, logistics network should be built up; development of e-commerce should be promoted actively, lever of industry information should be upgraded VI  STRATEGIES OF ENHANCING CITY LOGISTICS AND ECONOMY COUPLING RELATIONSHIP Logistics and economy supplement each other, the level of logistics development is determined by the level of economic development, and logistics development can be promoted development of economy with a rapid speed Logistics states and logistics activities are closely linked by economic operation environment. In order to promote city logistics and economy coupling relationship, seize the development opportunity of city logistics, enhance the competitive capability of city regional economy; this paper gives some advice as follows A  Give full play to city logistics and economy of government. In the development process of city logistics and economy, government promotion is an absolutely necessary element. Having been effected by planned economy so many years, the government’s management functions for logistics are separated by several functional departments. It is difficult to allocate resources effectively in this mode, and the policies are not perfect. The government department should persist the principle of that the logistics unifies the city overall economy development, the government guidance unifies the enterprise independent development, the government should formulate the policy and the laws for logistics, completes the macro-control of city logistics B  Construct city logistics network, and establish logistics center in the city economy center. Unite the water transportation, the road, the aviation, the railway together as an intercommunication network, to provide Multi-model Transportation in the operation, promote the integration of logistics further, optimize its industrial structure, satisfy the growth of the logistics need that comes from the fast development of economy ,establish the high level multi-purpose, strong collection and distribution function socialization logistics center, has the vital role in the city and in the local development, promote the primary industry, the second industry to reduce the cost, enhance the economic efficiency and optimize industrial structure. The quantity and quality of the logistics demand is closely related with the level of economic development C  Today development of e-commerce and industrialization logistics should be actively promoted. Technology is very important, and information technology is important to high efficiency logistics. With information technology such as bar coding, EDI technology, automatic sorting technology Freight tracking system, GPS and electronic ordering system etc,  make merchandise flow, logistics, information flow and fund flow synchronization under the surroundings of e-commerce. Rationalization and modernization of logistics will low cost of economy, improve the city economy move and quality, also it will promote rapid economic growth further  REFERENCE    LI Ji 014 zi 031 LIU Chun 014 ling 031 CHANG Ya 014 ping 031 LI Bai 014 xun 031 Integrated Analysis of the Organiza tional Succession in Cluster Supply Chain and the Development of Logistical Park 014§\014  014 The Case Study of IT Industry in Suzhou  China Soft Science   2006  P108-116   WA NG Yu 031 LE Mei-long 031 Business Logistics Outsourcing Decision Based on Artificial Neutral Network  2005  P83-86 031 101   Wenqin Cao  Junmin Yi, Relative economy factor influencing middle city logistics requirement and its relative analysis 2006 P242-243 


that had a larger allocation ITL testing smoothed the transition Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS Perhaps the primary reason that the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer INMS was included in Cassini's instrument suite was to analyze the atmosphere at Titan to inform the final decisions that would be made regarding the probe mission As Cassini neared this phase of the mission the INMS experienced unexpected resets The INMS team brought an EM INMS instrument to the ITL from their facilities at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in order to take advantage of the ITL's CDS H/W and debug the problem Although the bug was not found this work enabled the INMS team to develop a strategy to work around the problem and successfully return the valuable data Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA At various times the Cosmic Dust Analyzer CDA team has brought a flight spare and an EM CDA to the ITL from their home base at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg Germany They have used the ITL to successfully debug anomalous behavior and to validate and verify FSW deliveries Post-launch it was discovered that the in-flight CDA was susceptible to single event latch-ups The behavior was studied and a workaround was developed and tested in the ITL The solution involves a signal from the CDA when the condition is detected which triggers a CDS Fault Protection response that is executed by the PPS The use of the ITL was essential for developing and testing the solution on the ground as it could not be done in the CDA's stand-alone testbed The flight spare CDA was used in the ITL to ensure that changes to internal task scheduling in a new CDA FSW delivery did not affect S/C bus interaction S/C bus traffic timing analysis and system level tests were needed to demonstrate that proper functioning of the new FSW and this testing could only have been accomplished in the ITL 9 ANOMALY RESOLUTION There have been a few in-flight anomalies for Cassini 7 The ITL has been used in such cases to recreate the anomalous conditions and to test the recovery processes and the uplink products that were used in the recoveries In September 2007 there was a Solid State Power Switch SSPS 8 trip that resulted in a S/C safing event Cassini's first safing event during its primary mission The SSPS was one of a redundant pair powering the prime Telemetry Control Unit TCU Since this is a vital device the trip resulted in safing The safing event occurred only hours after an Iapetus flyby and recovery had an increased urgency as the science community anxiously awaited that data After the flight team confirmed the failure playback of the Iapetus flyby data was commanded and the process to be followed for recovery was identified The special files and procedures required for the recovery were tested in the ITL and the recovery was accomplished successfully in flight 10 TRAINING Periodically the Cassini flight team conducts Operational Readiness Tests ORTs These are essentially exercises in which a hypothetical problem is presented to the flight team and the team must formulate and execute a recovery The ITL is used to simulate the problem and the recovery providing the team with as realistic an experience as possible as for the AACS and CDS subsystems at least telemetry from the ITL is very similar to flight telemetry Additionally only a small subset of the flight team is dedicated to preparing the fault scenario those team members responsible for designing the fault and initializing the testbed then step aside under strict orders to maintain silence while the rest of the team determines and corrects the fault These ORTs have tremendous value the TCU SSPS fault that actually occurred in flight and was discussed in the preceding section was fortuitously chosen by the Cassini Spacecraft Office Manager Julie Webster as the fault scenario for an ORT in 2006 which of course made detection and recovery when the fault actually occurred in flight even more swift and sure The Cassini ITL has also been used to train both Cassini personnel and new JPL employees who have been hired for other project assignments Such training has involved the engineer functioning as a test analyst for 6 months The ITL benefits from the extra manpower and the employee benefits from the training and the exposure to a large flight project 11 CONCLUSION Cassini continues to enjoy a long and successful primary mission The ITL has been an important component in that success and continues to provide valuable services to the mission These services include  Deferred FSW Development and Testing  Unplanned FSW Development and Testing  FSW Updates  Ground System Testing 7 


 Flight Activity Testing  Flight Instrument Testing  Anomaly Resolution  Training The ITL has proven its value to the Cassini Mission to Saturn time and again Originally created for the integration of flight H/W and the development of FSW the ITL was maintained to accomplish Cassini's deferred development Interestingly enough while that deferred development was taking place the ITL was becoming an essential component of instrument testing and sequence development as well as maneuver and flight activity testing So in Cassini's case the ITL was necessary for post-launch activities i.e deferred development but as a result of being available during the prime mission proved to be an invaluable resource for purposes that were not originally anticipated The cost of the ITL has varied over the course of the Cassini mission but typically approaches 10 of the Cassini Spacecraft Office Operations budget i.e the engineering operations budget as distinguished from the science operations budget At present the ITL annual budget is approximately 800,000 during Integration during Assembly Test and Launch Operations ATLO and during critical sequence testing the ITL team was larger and so the cost was higher The annual cost to maintain the testbed regular cleaning certifications instrument calibration facilities maintenance etc is approximately 25,000 These costs are significant but not prohibitive and this paper has shown that the ITL has proven to be a valuable asset to the Cassini Mission and has justified its expense As Cassini plans its 3-year extended mission the ITL is included in that plan to continue in its present capacity That capacity includes engineers with expertise in the AACS and the CDS who function as test operators and analysts engineers with expertise in SE H/W and S/W who maintain the SE and implement improvements and a System Administrator the ITL maintains a web page so that test reports and test data are web-accessible and the data is also archived With some overlap in expertise and some engineers working only part-time on Cassini the ITL team at the present time is comprised of the equivalent of about 4 full time employees Many flight projects use System Testbeds for the purposes of integrating flight H/W and testing critical activities purposes that are sometimes accomplished by launch and generally by arrival at their destinations The author recommends that such flight projects seriously consider maintaining System Testbeds throughout the lives of their missions The use of a System Testbed the Cassini ITL has activities removed errors and oversights in flight procedures through testing credibly tested ground system tools and software improved maneuvers and solved problems that have occurred in flight At less than 10 of the engineering operations budget System Testbeds provide improved reliability improved functionality a significant and positive impact on mission success and a substantial return on investment ACRONYMS AACS  ATLO  CAPS  CDA  CDS  EM ESA FSW  HGA  HIW  IEB INMS ISS ITL IVD IVP JPL MGDS NAC  NASA  ORT  OTM  PPS RCS REU RFS RSS RWA S/C SCET SE SFP SoI SRU SSA SSPS SSR TCM TCU VIMS WAC Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Assembly test and Launch Operations Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Cosmic Dust Analyzer Command and Data Subsystem Engineering Model European Space Agency Flight Software High Gain Antenna Hardware Immediate Execution Block Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer Imaging Science Subsystem Integrated Test Lab Inertial Vector Definition Inertial Vector Propagation Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-mission Ground Data System Narrow Angle Camera National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operational Readiness Test Orbit Trim Maneuver Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem Reaction Control System Remote Engineering Unit Radio Frequency Subsystem Radio Science Subsystem Reaction Wheel Assembly Spacecraft Spacecraft Event Time Support Equipment System Fault Protection Saturn Orbit Insertion Stellar Reference Unit Sun Sensor Assembly Solid State Power Switch Solid State Recorder Trajectory Correction Maneuver Telemetry Control Unit Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer Wide Angle Camera improved science data return improved instrument 8
