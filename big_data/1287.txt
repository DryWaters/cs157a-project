Faced with the\nchallenge of integrating data with widely varying characteristics,\nwe decided to pursue an approach based on the property\ngraph model and corresponding graph databases. These provide\nintuitive modelling capabilities and the ability to ?uently evolve\nin structure to meet the needs of the data but require more basic\nimplementation work, as the technology is less mature.\nI INTRODUCTION\nThe European Holocaust Research Infrastructure \(EHRI Infrastructure project\nthat aims to bring together collections and materials with\nresearcher practices on the Holocaust. It includes over 20\npartners, many of which are key archives and other collection\nholding institutions in the ?eld, from Yad Vashem in Israel,\nto the Dutch NIOD, the Shoa Memorial in France and the\nWiener Library in London. Details of the kind of research\nwe want to enable and general requirements are described in\n[1]. This paper presents the technical approach we are taking\nto creating an environment that is both ?exible enough to\nallow for the integration of heterogeneous material and that is\nsuf?ciently social to allow researchers to discover and analyse\ntheir material and make new connections.\nOne of the main components of the EHRI infrastructure\nwill be an integrated research environment for Holocaust\nscholars to explore the data sets and collection descriptions that\nwe provide. Our user requirements work has made it clear that\nwhile there are commonalities, such as easy and fast access to\nthe material, the questions researchers are likely to ask of the\ndata have great variability. Other work we have done in the\n?eld of arts and humanities e-Research with different kind of\nuser groups supports this conclusion [2].\nThe requirement of a dynamically evolving research envi-\nronment can be seen not just for arts and humanities research\nbut across several other disciplines where the focus is on inter-\nacting with the research data. In fact, this focus on the ability\nto organise, analyse, and create exchanges around data has\nbecome one of the few general commonalities that has bound\ntogether disciplines in the various e-Science programmes. In\n2008, Dave de Roure [3], one of the pioneers of the UK e-\nScience programme, consequently announced a new e-Science\nin a keynote at the annual IEEE e-Science meeting, which\nconcentrated on enabling this new kind of interaction which\ndata intensive research requires. We would like to suggest that\nthe new e-Science needs to enable ?exible interaction and\ncollaboration with data. We need data infrastructures that can\nadapt to the new questions that e-Science wants to ask without\nlosing data or making complicated changes to data formats and\nschemas. A fundamental feature of research applications is that\nit is hard to foresee what kind of data we need to integrate\nnext and that realistically we must expect it to be unique in\nits setup and formats. Holocaust studies works with a great\nvariety of sources and our infrastructure needs to facilitate\nthis. For EHRI, the technical design challenge was to innovate\na dynamic, research-driven environment, where new material\nis constantly discovered added and analysed.\nOne solution that we did not want to follow is to limit the\namount of information we provide to a lowest common denom-\ninator. We started to investigate a new kind of infrastructure\nthat would allow us to focus on the content as a researcher\nwould need it and take the data as we found it heterogeneous\nand often incomplete, from different sources but even in this\nform useful to the researcher.\nNeither requirement ?ts well to traditional data stores such\nas relational databases, which typically require a prede?ned\nunderstanding of the underlying data structure which must\nbe elaborately migrated to a new schema should a new\nunderstanding emerge. While relational databases are more\nthan capable of storing extremely generic data structures, doing\nso is a trade-off against both ease of access and semantic\ncoherence. We were keen to avoid the ‘fallacy of prescience’,\nthe pitfall described by Smith, Deshaye and Stoicheff where\ninitial assumptions limit what can later be done with the data\n[4].\nThis paper analyses our work with a new data infrastructure\nbased around graph-based NoSQL technologies. Our initial\nexperience has made us con?dent that NoSQL has signi?cant\npotential to help mitigate some of the traditional challenges\nin our domain. In Section III, we analyse the technical design\ndecisions to set up a graph-based data infrastructure. However,\nsince many of these technologies are relatively new \(in imple-\nmentation, if not theory BACKGROUND — NOSQL GRAPH DATABASES\nOur work is based on our own research into how to\nintegrate humanities data, from data grids [5] to Linked Data\nenvironments [6].

Downstream\nengagement of sites S1 and Si with i ? 4 are by de?nition 0.\nOur measure was de?ned speci?cally to capture inter-\nsite engagement. Several other de?nitions were also at-\ntempted, such as the fraction of time users spent on the\nprovider network out of the total session time. Since these\ntwo de?nitions, and others, were found to lead to highly\ncorrelated measures of inter-site engagement, we report\nour investigation with the measure de?ned as above, and\nleave the investigation of alternative measures of inter-site\nengagement for future work.\nWe also report results using dwell time, a common mea-\nsure of engagement, allowing us to position our proposed\nmeasure. Dwell time is the total time a user spends visiting\ncontiguous pages within a speci?c site.\nIV. DATA\nOur study required collecting both user behavior data\nfor computing the three measures described in the previous\nsection, and site data, for analyzing page stylistics \(page\nlayout and structure main page of 50\npopular Yahoo! sites \(in terms of page views the time of writing,\nrelatively few major internet content providers have more\nthan 50 different content sites some well-known ones are\nyahoo.com, google.com, msn.com and wikipedia.org to carry out our study.\nAlthough we collected the main page of these sites, they\nare representative of most other pages of the site because\nthey use similar stylistic guidelines. For reason of con-\n?dentiality we denote each site by one of the following\nsix categories: country main page \(e.g., uk.yahoo.com e.g., auctions.yahoo.com e.g.,\nweather.yahoo.com e.g., games.yahoo.com news\n\(e.g., news.yahoo.com e.g., omg.yahoo.\ncom e.g eurosport.yahoo.com each site at each time and\ndate. The attributes at the top were general site parameters,\nincluding site ID time of day, date, etc. The attributes\nat the bottom determine the stylistics of a page, which\nare themselves of two types, layout and structure. Layout\nrefers to how the web page is displayed, its images, tables,\netc whereas the structure is concerned with the links and\ntheir positions on the web page. The top set of attributes\nwere included to study temporal and site-speci?c effects\non downstream engagement, as opposed to stylistic effects;\nfor example, performing some typical online activities at\nspeci?c times of the day and on speci?c days of the week.\nUser data was collected from a sample of users who\ngave their consent to provide browsing data through the\nYahoo! toolbar. A total of 19.4M sessions were recorded\nfrom approximately 265,000 users. These users represent a\n230\nTable I\nATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH SITE PAGES – GENERAL AND\nSTYLISTIC STRUCTURE AND LAYOUT GMT a workday or weekend;\nStructure attributes\n+ Number of links, partitioned by:\n– Location \(title or body of the HTML e.g., an HTML page e.g., speci?c images e.g., an embedded video Linking to the same site, to other Yahoo! sites,\nor to non-Yahoo! sites;\n+ Average rank of links in the page i.e. whether the links\nlocated mostly on the top of the page, or near the bottom;\n+ Unique links;\nLayout attributes\n+ Number of script tags, i.e. used to de?ne a client-side\nscript, such as a JavaScript;\n+ Number of all HTML classes \(one feature per class their online time on Yahoo! sites, and our goal is to study\ninter-site engagement on the Yahoo! network. To protect user\nprivacy, no user identi?ers were recorded, and only the top\nlevel domain was used in our analysis. We stripped the URLs\nto the last 3 components \(for example mail.yahoo.com reduce the effect of sub-domains containing\nsimilar content \(e.g., health in Yahoo! Lifestyle the 50 sites we analyzed, the large majority of browsing\nevents happened on the main third-level domain, and not in\nits sub-domains. The user data was used to measure average\ndwell time and average downstream engagement for each\nof the sites at each time and date. Note that the last page\nin each session cannot be taken into account because we\ncannot record the time at which a user leaves the site.\nThe user and main page datasets were joined by site, date\nand time, such that for each site and each date and time\ncombination there was a measure of the average downstream\nengagement and dwell time, as well as a vector of corre-\nsponding style attributes collected around the time that site\nengagement was measured.\nV. DOWNSTREAM ENGAGEMENT\nWe study now how site characteristics \(layout, structure\nand general and are predictive of engagement. First, we present some general statistics\nof downstream engagement for the 50 sites under 


study.\nWe then study the effect of the general, link and layout\nattributes on downstream engagement, also focusing on three\ncase studies. We end with a number of further insights.\nA. Variations in Downstream Engagement\nWe ?rst report the distribution of the downstream engage-\nment scores – “engagement scores” for short. Figure 2 shows\nthe engagement scores distribution \(average: 0.18, standard\ndeviation: 0.14 scores lie around 0.2. This may be due\nFigure 3. Average engagement scores distributions per cluster Cluster\n1 consists of 9 members, cluster 2 of 28 members, and cluster 3 of 13\nmembers.\nto those sessions corresponding to sites that people check on\na regular basis during a typical online session. Indeed, the\nsites corresponding to these sessions are visited, on average,\nan order of magnitude more frequently than the average, and\nas a result the time spent on them will tend to be short.\nWe also report the average engagement score of the 50\nsites under study in Figure 2 \(left engagement over the period\nwe tested, and some sites have a much stronger average\ndownstream engagement than others. The sites with the\nhighest average engagement are leisure and sport sites \(sites\nto which users come to spend time on, e.g., to play or read informational sites \(sites to which users come\nfor speci?c purposes, e.g., to purchase or check something those with the\nlowest scores can be considered as goal-oriented sessions.\nWe return to this in Section VI.\nTo identify types \(if any distribu-\ntion of engagement scores per site was binned according to\nquantiles, and the resulting vectors of quantiles used to char-\nacterize the engagement on a given site. Using the k-means\nalgorithm and the L2 norm for distances, we identi?ed three\nclusters, which was the maximal number that resulted in\nnon-empty sets. We did not ?nd a priory characteristics of\nsites which would suggest their cluster membership, i.e., not\nall country-speci?c main pages were assigned to the same\ncluster, indicating that each of these sites and their respective\naudiences has its own characteristics.\nThe average distribution of each of the clusters is\nshown in Figure 3. As the ?gure shows, two of the\nclusters have a lognormal-like distribution, differentiated\nby the average engagement score. The last cluster has an\n231\nFigure 2. Distribution of downstream engagement scores left right site. The error bars show one standard deviation across time.\nexponential-like distribution with most engagement scores\nclose to zero. Thus, different sites are characterized by\ntypical engagement patterns, with some sites exhibiting a\nwide range of engagement ranges, while others are more\nlikely to generate little or no downstream engagement. In\nSection V-C, we focus on three case studies, one per cluster,\nand discuss how different stylistic and other elements are\ncorrelated with each of these engagement styles.\nB. Stylistic Attributes and Engagement\nIt is known that the style of a page is correlated with\ndwell time. In this section we test whether style attributes\nare correlated with engagement, by attempting to predict\ndownstream engagement \(i.e., inter-site engagement classi?ca-\ntion, and 10-fold cross-validation to reduce the chance of an\nover-?t, for this purpose. We trained site-speci?c classi?ers\nby setting the threshold for signi?cant engagement as one\nstandard deviation above the average engagement for each\nsite separately. As discussed in Section IV, we include non-\nstylistic attributes in our prediction, to compare their effect to\nthat of stylistic page attributes on downstream engagement.\nThe average performance is reported.\nThe ten sites with the highest AUC obtained an average\nAUC of 0.67 \(min 0.60, max: 0.80 min: 0.31, max: 0.54 special interest, and e-commerce sites, and\nare distributed across the three set of clusters identi?ed in\nSection V-A. We noted that some sites do not lend them-\nselves to prediction of engagement. These includes several\nof the informational, leisure and country main pages. Using\nmore sophisticated classi?ers, or looking at the Yahoo! sites\noffered by each country1 may improve this result.\nExamining the top ten sites by popularity, the ?ve most\n1A internal study of 800 Yahoo! sites worldwide showed that traf?c\nbetween sites varies per country, with no particular patterns.\nfrequently chosen features \(in descending order of fre-\nquency non-image and non-video of the HTML\n3 non-image and non-video non-\nYahoo! sites in the body of the HTML\n5 content or manipulating content, for example\nusing JavaScript.\nObviously, the time of the day is highly in?uential. People\nspend longer time online during particular times of the day,\nthus increasing downstream engagement during those times,\nand this independently of the site in question.\nThe above list also suggests that link placements \(as given\nby the average position in the ranking of Yahoo! links Yahoo! links can in?uence downstream\nengagement. Link placement and number of links have\nalready been used as 


a means to keep users engaged within\na site. It is interesting that these seem to act similarly\nwith respect to site engagement across sites, where different\nservices are offered \(e.g., various types of content that content providers\nusually make it clear that such links will bring users to\nexternal sites. Our hypothesis is that users see a richer\npage when such links abound, and, when faced with such\nabundance, decide to focus their attention on a central\nrepository of information, rather than visiting a multitude\nof external sites. This hypothesis, however, requires further\ninvestigation through user-centred studies.\nC. Case Studies\nWe focus on three case studies to gain further insights\non the effect of page stylistics on downstream engagement.\nWe investigated three sites, randomly selected from one for\neach of the clusters identi?ed in Section V-A \(Figure 3 f-measure\ne-commerce 0.63 0.38\nnews 0.65 0.37\nwomen-interests 0.72 0.43\nFigure 4. Precision-Recall graph for downstream engagement in a news\nwebsite.\nThese are an e-commerce site, a news site, and a women-\ninterests site. The average engagement for those sites was\n0.26 \(±0.31 0.02 0.06 respectively.\nWe used a linear classi?er because it gave better perfor-\nmance than the decision trees. The AUC and f-measures\nobtained are shown in Table II. Note that the accuracy of\nthe classi?ers is lower than that obtained for the entire set\nof sites, which is likely due to the sparsity of the training\ndata, compared to using the entire data set from all sites.\nNonetheless, interesting insights were derived.\nThe ROC for the news site is shown in Figure 4. We\ncan identify 50% of the samples above the threshold at a\ncost of approximately 20% of false detections. This suggests\nthat the best features in the classi?er could be useful for\nimproving downstream engagement, and that most instances\nof high engagement can be correctly inferred at a relatively\nlow false-detection rate.\nUsing sequential forward feature selection, we found that\nthe best features for each classi?er were as shown in Table\nIII. There are mainly stylistic attributes in this list First,\nstylistic attributes such as links to non-Yahoo! sites feature\nprominently for both the news and women-interests sites,\nbut not for the e-commerce site. This may be due to the\ndifferent nature of these sites, where in the former users\nexpect to see more external content. A low average rank\nof links to Yahoo sites, i.e., if they are displayed towards\nthe top of the page, is important for increasing downstream\nengagement in the e-commerce and women-interests sites,\npossibly because structurally, the news changes less and thus\nthis attribute has a smaller effect. Additional links to video\ncontent on the news site increase engagement, while external\nimage links have this effect on the women-interests site.\nNon-stylistic attributes include time of day and day of\nthe week for the e-commerce site, which are related to the\nway people interact with the site \(speci?c time of the day as\nwell as speci?c day of the week women-\ninterest site, no non-stylistic attributes were prominent in\npredicting downstream engagement.\nHere we have shown, through three case studies, that the\nstyle elements of a site can predict downstream engagement.\nSome of our ?ndings \(in terms of the in?uential features nonetheless they provide in-\nteresting insights to the effect of a site on downstream\nengagement. In addition using a larger set of data \(here\nwe are using one month only signi?cant insights.\nD. Textual content versus style\nThis paper focuses on stylistic attributes of websites their\nmain pages engagement, as compared\nto stylistic attributes. That is, we explore the actual page\ncontent. We extracted the text from each crawled page and\nmodeled it in two ways. First, we used a vector-space model,\nwhere each word is an attribute. Second, since raw text may\nbe too sparse, we also modeled the text by counting the\nnumber of entities of each type that appeared in the text, as\nidenti?ed using the Stanford Named Entity extractor.2\nWe measured the distances between two adjacent in-\nstances of the same site using the cosine similarity For\ncomparison purposes, we did the same for the stylistic\n\(layout and structure described above.\nWe found that in 86% of cases, the distance between the\nadjacent texts was greater than that of the stylistic attributes.\nThus, textual content changes faster than stylistics, and may\nrequire faster sampling to enable downstream engagement\nprediction. Next, we trained classi?ers using the same\nprocedures used for the stylistic attributes, as described\nabove. Both text representation methods obtained a worse\nprediction accuracy: 2% lower in AUC for the word-based\nrepresentation \(not statistically signi?cant and 7% lower\nfor the entity-based representation \(p < 0.01, sign-test stylistics and text did not\nimprove the classi?cation performance.\nThere could be several reasons for this lower performance.\nFirst, as noted above, text changes faster than stylistic\nattributes, so the predictor may be suffering from a too low\nsampling rate. Second, the text is sparser than stylistic at-\ntributes and is therefore harder to generalize from. However,\ngiven the poor results of the entity-based representation,\nthis 


seems to be a weaker explanation. Finally, text may\nbe inherently a worse predictor of downstream engagement,\nbecause it represents a poorer cue for users to browse other\n2http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml\n233\nTable III\nMOST INFLUENTIAL ATTRIBUTES FOR PREDICTING ENGAGEMENT IN THREE SPECIFIC SITES \(SIGNS IN PARENTHESIS INDICATE POSITIVE OR\nNEGATIVE SPEARMAN CORRELATION WITH DOWNSTREAM ENGAGEMENT   of unique Yahoo! links   Number of unique Yahoo! links non-image and non-video the HTML non-image and non-video  Number of video links within the page  sites in the body of the HTML  page non-image and non-video  Number of Java scripts on the page engagement ‘incentive’ than a text \(a news article sessions may be more sensitive to changes aimed\nat increasing downstream engagement level than others For\nexample, a user who accesses a site to check for emails may\nbe less in?uenced by additional browsing opportunities from\nposted links, than a user who is browsing for leisure. We\ncall the ?rst kind of sessions goal-speci?c, and distinguish\nbetween goal-speci?c sessions and all other sessions in\nthe following manner. We use the following procedure to\ndistinguish between the two types of sessions. The objective\nis not to identify a session type as it develops, or whether a\nuser belongs to one category rather than another \(we leave\nthis for future work engagement.\nFor each user, the ?ve most common sites he or she\nvisited during the data collection period were identi?ed.\nFor information, in our data set, the most frequent common\nsites were related to mail, search and social networks. We\nhypothesis that sessions in which 50% or more of the visited\nsites belonged to the ?ve most common sites \(for that\nuser the sessions. Approximately 92% of\nusers had sessions with both kinds of sites. The average\ndownstream engagement in goal-speci?c sessions was 0.16.\nThis is to be contrasted with a higher average downstream\nengagement of 0.2 during other sessions.\nIf engagement of non goal-speci?c sessions is more\nin?uenced by stylistic changes, it should be easier to predict\nusing style attributes. Following the procedure described in\nSection V-B, we were able to predict engagement with an\nAUC of 0.76 for goal-speci?c sessions, and an AUC of\n0.81 for other sessions. This implies that when users do\nnot have speci?c goals in mind, they may be more ready\nto accept suggestions \(more links, more images, etc and we can in?uence their engagement\nin this way. The fact that there is an effect of task type on\nengagement measures \(such as dwell time see early work in [12 this\nfact, and show that downstream engagement patterns are also\nin?uenced by some given task types.\nAdditional work is required to identify more ?ne-grained\nsession classes \(besides goal-speci?c versus others here and\nhypothesized here e.g. en-\ntertainment versus fact-?nding user browsing history\nand external factors like the time of the day or the day\nof the week are likely to be useful. Also, using mouse\ntracking recording such as in [6] \(applied to search ner-grained online tasks.\nVII. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENGAGEMENT AND\nDWELL TIME\nDwell time is the time spent contiguously on a site, and\nis a popular measure of site engagement. It is often used as\none of the of?cial standard measures by the web analytics\ncommunity and Internet market research companies such as\ncomScore. The distribution of dwell time for the Yahoo! 50\nsites under study in this paper, shown in Figure VII left right varies much from\nsite to site, ranging from less than 5 seconds to more than\n15 minutes. The sites with the shortest dwell time are e-\ncommerce and sports sites. The highest average dwell time\nis recorded on leisure and home page country sites.\nInterestingly, the Spearman correlation between dwell\ntime and downstream engagement is small and negative:\n? = ?0.05 \(p < 10?5 associated with a slight reduction\nin dwell time. Users who spend more time on some site, will\nthus tend to spend less time elsewhere during their session,\nand vice versa. Finally, we look at the relation between\n234\nstylistic characteristics and dwell time using the same deci-\nsion tree procedure as in Section V-B. The corresponding\nprecision-recall and ROC graphs are shown in Figure 6.\nThe prediction accuracies are similar to those of downstream\nengagement.\nWe conclude that stylistic attributes may be used to predict\nsite dwell time as well as downstream engagement. The\n\(extremely small two\nmeasures seems to indicate that the provider \(here Yahoo 


optimize,\ni.e., engagement with respect to a particular site, or/and\nacross sites.3\nThis section shows that downstream engagement is clearly\nmeasuring something different, which, we argue, is inter-\nsite engagement Interestingly, style attributes are associated\nwith each of these measures, in a comparable manner.\nHowever they may differ across sites and measures, as\ndemonstrated in [19], where the effect of links \(to the same\nsite, another Yahoo! site, or a site outside the Yahoo! net-\nwork site itself.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper is concerned with measuring inter-site engage-\nment This is a relevant big \(usage sites,\neach optimized separately. It is even more relevant at the\nglobal web level, to understand how inter-site engagement\nis generated at large. To this end, we propose a measure,\ndownstream engagement, which calculates the percentage of\ntime spent within sites from the provider in a contiguous\nfashion \(a provider session total session time which the downstream engagement is calculated, and as\nan application, we look at the web stylistic features of the\nsite, e.g. the layout and the structure of the main page of a\nsite, for 50 popular Yahoo! properties.\nOur extensive experiments showed that the stylistic fea-\ntures associated with the main page of many of the sites in-\nvestigated in this paper can be used to “predict” downstream\nengagement with good accuracy. Further work reported in\n[19] showed the impact and importance of links and their\ntype in inter-site engagement, depending on the site. Our\ninvestigation of the impact of the content of a site, as\nopposed to its stylistic features found that the former was\nnot a good predictor of downstream engagement. Finally, we\nshowed that downstream engagement is different from dwell\ntime, a common measure of engagement.\nOur analysis is retrospective in nature, which makes it\nharder to establish that downstream engagement can be\n3We should emphasize that a small negative but signi?cant correlation\n– as is the case here – when dealing with millions of user sessions is\nmeaningful, as it can, for instance, impact revenues \(e.g. obtained through\nadvertising stylistic attributes also implies that such at-\ntributes can in?uence engagement. However, several ndings\nsuggest that such a causal effect exists. First, previous studies\nhave demonstrated this relationship for dwell time. Second,\nour ?ndings demonstrate the predictive ability as a function\nof session type. Third our analysis shows that changes in\nstyle over time, though uncorrelated with it, have an effect on\ndownstream engagement. Thus, although careful randomized\nstudies are required to positively prove a causal effect our\nresults suggest that this effect exists.\nThis work provides new insights into site engagement.\nAlthough relating page style and engagement \(e.g. dwell\ntime  look\nat the effect of the network of sites on site engagement. Our\nresults open up a new line of research that of measuring\ninter-site engagement. We are now looking at how these\n?ndings can be used by web-masters and editors, among\nothers, to improve inter-site engagement, here at Yahoo!.\nIn future work we will study more sites, including those\nfor which we obtained relatively poor results for predicting\nengagement from their stylistics, and use larger data sets\n\(e.g. several months of time and day. We will analyze in more detail\nthe data that we have already collected to ?nd out other\ninteresting relations that can in?uence inter-site engagement.\nUser studies are also planned to obtain a complementary\n\(qualitative lead to alternative de?ni-\ntions of downstream engagement, deemed more appropriate\nto typical or task-related user behavior on a site, e.g. star-like\nbehavior.\nOur ultimate aim is to understand how to improve the\nengagement with users across a network of sites. Studying\ninter-site engagement is important for companies offering a\ndiverse range services, such as Yahoo! or AOL, but also for\nthose with a more limited range of services \(e.g. LinkedIn,\nFacebook e.g. Amazon Wikipedia categories can be viewed as a speci?c site, and\nthe same methodology can be used to predict downstream\nengagement across these categories. The Wikipedia project\ncan also bene?t from this work. Indeed Wikipedia offers\ndifferent functionalities, and each of them can be viewed as\na site on its own. It will be important to investigate how\nour ?ndings generalize to any of the above and extend the\nanalysis to larger data samples.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Att?eld, G. Kazai, M. Lalmas, and B.

compression method\nthat clips out image parts not of primary interest. Traditional\ndata compression variations could be explored in a responder\ncontext. For example, some man-made disasters such as\nchemical spills are hazardous to responders but may not\nbe detectable from simple imagery. Hyperspectral sensors\ncould potentially warn responders, but have data volumes\ntoo high for transmission to a phone. Years of research has\nbeen devoted to hyperspectral data compression [68] but data\nvolumes are still too high for mobile computing.\nIn summary, earth quantization provides a novel way to\npartition the earth and opens a new horizon for rapid wide\nscale dissemination of large amounts of remote sensing data\nat near real-time rates. The Fast-Earth geospatially-organized\ncache and server based on the earth quantization concept has\npotential to transform future remote sensing dissemination\nand image processing capabilities.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
