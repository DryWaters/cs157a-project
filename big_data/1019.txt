It allows mobile users to access text based data services without continuously occupying a specific radio channel \(which is not the case when you access voice channel This paper successfully discusses the possibility of exploiting the data communication features of GGSN/SGSN to transmit voice packets, using a web server. This can help GPRS grow beyond its capability. As the data channel is considered to be economically viable in any network, If a mechanism is devised to use mobile  s data channel for voice communication too, it will obviously be preferred over the conventional Non-Mobile based VOIP service . Because of the fact that General Packet Radio Service through the GGSN/SGSN element can transfer data at the rate of 56 to 114 kbps \(For EDGE it is 177.6 kbps connection to internet via the core network elements, so if the voice at one end be broken into data packets and transmitted through a web server, can be reassembled at the other end. This process wont make a big hole in the customer  s pocket and can easily make the VOIP go mobile using the same network elements. While the traditional circuit switched network makes a quite bigger hole if the call is a long distance  Keywords- SGSN, GGSN, Voice over GPRS, VGPRS GSM, GPRS, VOIP over Mobile, MIME, PHP, J2ME, SIP RTP  1. INTRODUCTION The conventional calling system, be it wired or wireless is a very costly technology when it comes to long distance calling or trunk calling. Being costly is the inherent property of this technology due to its circuit switching nature. But Voice Over Internet Protocol VOIP but till recently VOIP has a limitation of being immobile i.e. both the Caller and the Callee must be seated in front of his workstation or Laptop. Few works have been carried out to exploit the data transfer capability of the 2.5 G/2.75 G mobile technology. As Cell phone or Handhelds have the feature of being mobile, if a mechanism is devised to transfer voice files over GGSN/SGSN, it will add a feather in the cap of GPRS/EDGE as well as make a new way of communication on mobiles apart from SMS and Voice Circuit Switched SGSNs route packets to and from the geographical SGSN area, while GGSNs interface with external IP packet networks. The SGSN and GGSN are physically separate from the circuit-switched part of the cellular system core 


from the circuit-switched part of the cellular system core network. The users in conventional mobile networks are charged on a per minute basis to make calls and in some countries even to receive calls. But as far as the data channel of GPRS is concerned, in some countries it is even free while in some countries it is free till a limited data transfer; while in most of the countries it is very cheaper as compared to the voice channel The GSNs \(GPRS Support Nodes wireless packet platform \(WPP high-performance packet-switching platform. The WPP which is used for GPRS, EDGE as well as UMTS combines features usually associated with data communications \(such as compactness and high functionality such as robustness and scalability advancement in Internet technology and enhanced bandwidth, VOIP became quite popular. But due to its immobile limitation, it cannot be used while the user is on the move. The end-users of VOIP have to be seated in front of the computer screen to make or receive calls over a computer application. But if data communication can be exploited for voice communication, it can be very beneficial for the technology itself as well as the end users and in addition to that it can also be exploited to voice conference N-number of mobile users irrespective of their geographical location based on the available bandwidth with proper Quality of Service \(QOS return, the end users have to pay only for the data usage of GPRS/EDGE  1.1 Existing Work Although there is no full proof work for end to end voice solution over the GGSN/SGSN, but some solutions and/or proposals exists  a Burdet ET. Al. developed a VOIP solution for mobile devices through Bluetooth using a ISBN 978-89-5519-139-4 -682- Feb. 15-18, 2009 ICACT 2009  Symbian O.S [7]. But our work and future proposals are completely different b Yi-Bing Lin et. al. proposed replacement of traditional GSM Mobile Switching Center MSC VMSC  paper is different from our work and proposal as we have not suggested replacing the existing MSC architecture  1.2 Our way Initially we started off to test the bandwidth capability and data transmission speed of the GGSN/SGSN by transferring simple text files and image files from one mobile station \(MS successfully testing the files ranging from 10 KB to 130 KB between the MS, we devised the idea to use the data channel of GPRS which is supported by the GSN network element for voice feature and in the due course of time, we realized that we still have some way to add video feature too in our developed application  2. PART 1 To exploit the data channel capability of GPRS for voice evolved couple of years back in our mind, when we were a part of a wireless awareness group called Wireless Application Protocol Awareness Forum \(WAPAF idea was simple; we thought to exploit the bandwidth of GPRS for voice transfer that could enable voice chatting with low cost &amp; add mobility to Internet VOIP. The least we expected out of this was a low cost technique of communication on mobile devices other than SMS, MMS 


communication on mobile devices other than SMS, MMS and circuit switched voice  2.1 Working of GGSN/SGSN SGSN The SGSN is a primary component of cellular networks that employ GPRS. Via the radio network, the SGSN routes incoming and outgoing IP packets addressed to or from any GPRS subscriber physically located within the geographical area served by that SGSN 3] Each SGSN provides ciphering \(encryption and decryption authentication session management and communication set-up to the mobile subscriber mobility management - that is, support for roaming and handover within and between mobile networks Connection to other nodes \(HLR, MSC BSC, SMS-GMSC, SMS-IWMSC, GGSN The SGSN also collects charging data for each mobile subscriber, such as the actual use of the radio network and GPRS network resources  GGSN The GGSN is also a primary component of cellular networks that employ GPRS. The GGSN serves as the interface to external IP packet networks, accessing external ISP functions such as routers and remote access dial-in user service \(RADIUS external IP network, the GGSN routes the IP addresses of subscribers served by the GPRS network, exchanging routing information with the external network. The GGSN sets up communication with external networks and manages GPRS sessions. It also includes functionality for associating subscribers to the appropriate SGSN. For each mobile subscriber, the GGSN also collects charging data-use of the external data network and use of GPRS network resources  2.2  Design Methodology We combined our knowledge of web  services &amp mobile technologies to port voice over GGSN/SGSN in Phase 1. We thought of a raw idea of two simple zones where the voice of the caller will be recorded and stored The callee would fetch the recorded data from the caller zone in order to listen what the caller has said. And record his voice in the callee zone which can be retrieved by the caller. But in the phase 1 design, the QOS and real time communication was a challenge. So in order to overcome these challenges, the design of Phase 2 has been proposed  Conventional GSM Architecture  Figure 1  GSM Architecture  Typical GSM architecture is composed of three major Sub-systems.

When a web page or an application is accessed using a PC/Mobile based browser, the "Web Server" tells the browser about the kind of document it should expect This is done by using MIME-types. The common MIME type for a plain HTML document is "text/html". However, for a WAP micro browser, which cannot read a particular format, the MIME type has to be different. The necessary MIME types which we installed on our server are  MIME Types for VOICE ARCHITECTURE support AddType text/vnd.wap.wml .wml AddType image/vnd.wap.wbmp .wbmp AddType application/vnd.wap.wmlc .wmlc AddType text/vnd.wap.wmlscript .wmls AddType application/vnd.wap.wmlscriptc wmlsc AddType application/x-midi .mid AddType application/xhtml+xml .xhtml xht AddType application/xml .xml .xsl AddType application/xml-dtd .dtd AddType application/xslt+xml .xslt AddType video/3gpp .3gp  The last mime type is for the video support. We installed these MIME types in the srm.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf directory of the Web Sever  3. PART 2 


3. PART 2 ISBN 978-89-5519-139-4 -684- Feb. 15-18, 2009 ICACT 2009   We implemented the first Part 1 working model of VOICE OVER GGSN/SGSN with the existing infrastructure as discussed above using PHP at the backend and XHTML at the front-end. XTML has been used because WML does not have the functionality of uploading any file from the MS to the server. We have exploited the file uploading feature of XTML to submit the voice file by configuring our server with the required MIME type as discussed in section 2.3. Our voice and video model works as below  3.1  Data channel for Voice MS1 caller as depicted in figure 3 opens the URL for the caller zone i.e.  http://www.voiceovergprs.org voice/index.xhtml records his voice and submits the file as Voice.Mid. This voice file is sent to the Internet Web server through the MS1-&gt;R1-&gt;BSC-&gt;GGSN/SGSN&gt;Web Server-&gt;R2 -&gt;MS2 path to the callee at the other end who is logged-in into the callee zone. This file is saved in the caller zone under the directory home/public_html/voice/file_uploads. When the callee requests this file, he opens the URL http://www.voiceovergprs.org/voice/. He/she gets the file in the index directory of voice folder. His/Her request is too processed the same way i.e. MS2-&gt;R2-&gt;BSC&gt;GGSN/SGSN--&gt;Web server-&gt;R1-&gt;MS1. He listens to the voice file and replies to the caller by recording his voice and submitting it into the caller zone. The caller receives the file and listens to it with any of the voice player installed on the MS. The access to this zone can be restricted by using simple authentication PHP code. The MIME type configured at the server to support voice is Application/x-midi .mid  3.2 Data channel for Video The video zone also works in the similar way. The video sender records the video, logs in into the video sender zone, submits the file with .3gp extension and the video gets submitted stored in the video store. The viewers can retrieve it from the video store. The MIME type configured at the server to support video is Video/3gpp .3gp  4. Quality Assurance of PART 1 Upon successful implementation of PART 1, we did Q.A for the caller zone by NOKIA 6220 \(based on series 40 platform 1 edition based on S60 Platform 2nd Edition Feature Pack 2 to our experimental result it worked as we expected it to work  4.1 Q.A for Voice To QA voice, a voice file on MS1 was recorded as recording001.amr on NOKIA 6220, of duration 27 seconds and sent to MS2 via GGSN/SGSN through the URL http://www.voiceovergprs.org/voice/index.xhtml on the browser, submitted the file as Voice.Mid. The other user was logged in as callee on the Callee zone at the URL http://www.voiceovergprs.org/voice2/index.xhtml he too recorded his voice in the phone memory of NOKIA 6681 and submitted as Voice.Mid, we both received the file as tone and the file was successfully played in the voice media player of the respective MS  4.2 Scope We started our project just for the sake of transferring voice but ultimately we end up with an application which has a much wider range. The obvious 


application of this project can be as follows 4.2.1 Two persons located at different geographical locations can exchange their voices almost free of cost, or at a very low cost \(at a charge which is applicable per bytes operators in India provide unlimited data transfer rates at a specific monthly charge. No matter if caller is located in Germany &amp; the callee is located in India, the voice clarity will be the same as the caller &amp; callee located within 50 meters. This can eliminate the era of local STD &amp; ISD calls. This application is independent of the caller and callee locations 4.2.2 Anyone can share the video of a function instantly with n-number of persons located at different geographies who cannot attend that function 4.2.3 Anyone whose phone/external memory becomes full, he/she can upload the pictures, ring tones video clips etc to the respective zones of our server and can later download at his/her convenience. This could be advantageous in a situation like tours &amp; excursions, where one exhausts his/her memory by taking snaps and making video clips  More scopes can be visualized after the implementation of future enhancement components discussed at the last section of this chapter  5. PART 2: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION WITH ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE  This section deals with the next phase of VOICE OVER GGSN/SGSN and all possible future ISBN 978-89-5519-139-4 -685- Feb. 15-18, 2009 ICACT 2009  enhancements that could be incorporated in order to get the maximum benefit out of our work Voice over data is composed of signaling and data transport. In the phase II of VOICE OVER GGSN/SGSN, we would be using SIP, H323 protocols for signaling and RTP as the data transport protocol in order to make the conversation real time and to exploit the actual benefit of using data channel for voice  5.1 Session Initiation Protocol \(SIP   It is used to create modify and terminate multimedia sessions or conferences such as Internet Telephone calls Its message format is same as the HTTP message format  5.2 Real-time Transport Protocol \(RTP  This protocol will be used to transmit voice data once the session is established by the SIP. RTP is defined by Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF two parts a b Service \(QOS the participant in the call  5.3 Voice Codec  The Mobile devices by default support G.711 voice codec, so we will be using this codec; however G.729 has the best quality  5.4 Addition of Asterisk Exchange at the server level Asterisk is an open source Private Branch Exchange PBX 


PBX and VoIP networks. It also functions as a SIP proxy   Figure 3  SIP Message Sequence  Sequence for making the SIP call is illustrated in the above picture SDP is used to negotiate media sessions description between the caller and the callee. The media session description consist of Encoding format, payload type and sampling rate of voice packets, Socket for receiving voice packets As per our phase 2 design we will be using J2ME [6] to develop the VOICE OVER GGSN/SGSN application because of the availability of JSR 180 that supports SIP API on J2ME  5.4.1 SIP FOR J2ME: There are six SIP request method in SIP specification: REGISTER INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, BYE, OPTIONS Register: The registration works as follows registration is the first essential part for starting a session. A SIP registration message is generated and sent to Asterisk server. According to SIP specification, the transactions between client and asterisk server as illustrated in figure 4 Invite: It is the second step that is done after registration. SIP invitation message is generated 5.4.2 SDP for J2ME: When the caller wants to communicate with the callee, the session description details must be received by both the parties, and then a common media for voice packets would be chosen. SDP is used to describe the media details for the parties. SDP functions are gt; Define where the voice data should be sent such as the port number and IP address gt; Define the codec to be used by other party gt; Identify the channel and sample rate of voice data Following is one of the SDP message examples according to SDP specification [8 String SDP v=O \\n o=deanl0 0 IN IP4 203.94.167.28 n" t 5.4.3 RTP for J2ME: J2ME supports RTP instead of UDP. For RTP following points are required 1. Open connection for receiving 2. Receiving voice packets 3. RTP packet extraction 4. Custom data source for streaming 5. Player 6. Recording 7. Constructing RTP packets J2ME provides three methods to play back the media ISBN 978-89-5519-139-4 -686- Feb. 15-18, 2009 ICACT 2009  Create from a media locator is used to create a player to handle the media identified by the locator Create from a Data Source is used to handle an application-defined protocol Create from an Input Stream can be used to interface with other Java API's. This does not provide the necessary random seeking functionality  


 5.4.4 Network Bandwidth: RTP packets constructed at the caller end will travel through the GPRS network in our case, the theoretical bandwidth of GPRS is about 114 kbps while the size of audio data is 64 kbps This shows that the bandwidth is sufficient to accommodate our design with very little jitter  6. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ENHANCEMNT  We have showcased in this paper the attempt of earlier work related to transfer of voice over mobile devices and our design as well as implementation of voice communications over GGSN/SGSN in PART 1 and partial Working model of PART II were also evaluated As discussed in PART II, the application designed in J2ME can deliver RTP packets with no or less jitter if we use an asterisk exchange. SDP is used to negotiate media sessions description between both the MS. The media session description contains sampling rate of voice packets and Socket for receiving voice packets. Once the session is established through SIP, SDP is used for voice communication. Although our PART II design is complete it still needs some further enhancement to go through in order to achieve a high Quality of Service for voice \(QoS QoE different companies. The QoE still needs to be tested Furthermore in India we have mixed population of CDMA as well as GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular users, and our PART I as well as PART II are both not compatible with the CDMA technology because the handsets supplied by the CDMA operators are propriety and no contents can be downloaded to these handsets except theirs. The second most important thing at this juncture is that there is no way out for one MS to know whether another MS wants to initiate a call with it. Based on our PART II design we propose the following enhancement to accomplish and achieve the goal as discussed  To enhance the J2ME application based on our PART 2 design which is compatible with handsets manufactured by different companies and not only with Nokia 6220? This can be accomplished by designing a generic application in J2ME independent of the handsets However some handsets are even older to support the latest J2ME application, so this can be accomplished by using an application which can detect the browser as well as software version of the handset and send the required application as per the capacity of the handset  To accomplish the QoE and QoS our application must be capable to transfers the voice packets when the packets exceed the size equivalent to 6 seconds, after the callee has elapsed 3 seconds of voice, the caller application sends the next packet. This new packet should take another 2 seconds \(max application and should be ready in the buffer to deliver at the callee socket through the Asterisk Server. The server must be enhanced in order to process maximum voice files and connection sockets  The third enhancement can be incorporated in our PART 2 design is to support the feature of Audio conferencing which is possible only in 3G over IMS. If this feature is incorporated in our design it will have the capability to support n-number of users simultaneously for the conference  REFRECENCES 1] Rao, H.

The fact that the genotypes have been generated by recombination makes it very hard to close the set of bases by intersection. As mentioned before, haplotype inference studies usually select data from blocks where recombination probability is almost 0, so the instances in our experiments with recombination level 4, 16 and 40 are not even realistic but were tested because they are a kind of standard in the literature The results of the non-uniform instances are shown in table IV. Non-uniform instances are a little harder than uniform instances. Taking into consideration the number haplotypes generated by each preprocessing method we can see that the difference gets bigger as the problem size grows being zero or almost 0 for the smallest instances. It is also worth noticing that the time spent by the tabu search when data is preprocessed with the set-based preprocessing is lower than that of the RTIP preprocessing for 78 of the 90 instances The hapmap instances are considered hard; the execution

For small instances RTIP-based method is usually quicker and the number of haplotypes generated is almost the same as the number of haplotypes generated by the RTIP-based procedure. This is a deterministic process so execution times are quite similar Although the tabu search process was firstly implemented to test the preprocessing procedures it has proved to be an effective algorithm for the HIPP problem. The refinement process in the intensification phase is probably the strongest procedure in the tabu search; this is the procedure that, in most cases, returns the optimal solution Table V shows the result of the total number of instances solved by our algorithm another five solvers, which can be found in the reference section. Our algorithm, which was implemented in Java, was tested with a time limit of 10,000 seconds on a MacBook 2.1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor up to 2.16GHz and 3GB RAM, although, JVM  s maximum heap size \(on Mac OS X five solvers were tested by Lin  e and Marques-Silva  [10 with a time limit of 10,000 seconds, using a 1.9GHz Athlon XP. However, using different machines to test the solver does not mean that the number of solved instances can be increased, since, when solved, the executions of our algorithm never took longer than 4 minutes  VI. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new preprocessing algorithm for the HIPP problem coupled with a tabu search. This new preprocessing is based on manipulating subsets of haplotypes instead of haplotype units. The experimental results show that in the hardest instances this new preprocessing step can dramatically decrease the time spent by the whole algorithm \(preprocessing + tabu search fact is due to the reduction in the search space provoked by the new preprocessing. On the other hand, the new preprocessing does not work properly in instances with recombination. However, we can think about the two proposed preprocessing algorithm as complementary procedures, because the weaknesses of the set-based procedure \(recombination and small instances solved by the RTIP-based procedure As mentioned before, our aim was to develop a new preprocessing method to deal with large problem instances but, since the implemented tabu search has proved to be an effective algorithm, new functionalities should be developed  VII.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
