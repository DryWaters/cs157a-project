Plenary Paper : The Rise of Exaflood Optics George Gilder Forbes Telecosm Conference, USA Abstract ECOC 2009, 20-24 September, 2009, Vienna, Austria Paper 1.0.1 978-3-8007-3173-2  \251 VDE VERLAG GMBH Optics is now in its exaflood stage: with hundreds of exabytes of data swarming around worldwide webs of glass and light. An exabyte is 10 to the 18th, a billion gigabytes, a million billion big books of text or fifty thousand textual Libraries of Congress, enough to sati sfy the reading needs of the world\222s population for a century. Or one exabyte is just a hundred million high definition movies, har dly enough to satisfy a million teenagers for a year. For the past two decades has raged a war between the rise of Exaflood optics with its video tides and the persistence of a communications infrastructure based on vocal an d textual trickles. The trickleware has all gone mobile and wireless. Today the planetary utility of optical glass increasingly carries high definition images, virtual worlds, games, and telephonic telepresence, in a global sensorium, pushing the system toward the Zettabyte era of 10 to 21st. This requires a new optical architecture. It\222s first manifestations are inclement and cloudy for the industry. Most optics companies are following an uncreative, modular strategy, fitting components into existing systems. The real opportunity in optics is to create entirely new systems that adapt to a new age of optical entanglement appropriate to the age of telepresence. Don't solve problems, pursue opportunities 


  and physical file resources. An instance of FRB tree is shown in figure 1  Figure 1  The composition of FRB tree Virtual file resources consist of virtual directories and virtual files. Virtual directory is a directory that doesn’t exist on a storage device, but just in the memory. The root of the tree is a virtual directory. Virtual file is a file that doesn’t exist on a storage device either. A virtual directory can have virtual directories and virtual files as its children, which make up of the basis of this tree Physical file resources consist of physical directories and physical files, which are provided by some servers, such as HTTP servers or FTP servers. They all have URLs and can be accessed by using specific client tools 001\000 Directory Broker” is a virtual directory which is mapped from a physical directory existed on storage devices. Likewise File Broker” is a virtual file that is mapped from a physical file. The directory brokers and file brokers both belong to “File Resource Broker” \(FRB\. With FRB, file resources can be integrated into a tree, which provides unified view and access to these resources B  File Resource Locating As the file resources are organized into a FRB tree, each file resource has a unique path to the root. We can locate a file resource in this tree by the path. If we intend to access a file resource, its URL is required. The URL can be got from a service called “Naming Service”, which maintains a mapping relationship between FRB paths and URLs A file will inherit the mapping relationship from its parent automatically, which means that if the file’s parent is mapped to a FRB path “/Path”, then this file is automatically mapped to a full FRB path “/Path/Name” in which the term “Name represents for the file’s name This mapping can be changed by the users, so a consistency semantic is required in the implementation of FRB C  File Resource Accessing Once the URL of a file resource is got, we can access it using some specific client tools. However, in our design, a unique access interface is provided instead of various client tools. With a unique interface, few requirements are imposed on the application programmer, so that applications can be easily modified \(or written from scratch\ to execute efficiently On internet, the authentication, communication protocols access mechanisms of file resources are various. These heterogeneous file resources are wrapped as files on local file system. The users can access the file resources just as accessing the local files. This mechanism provides transparency to users so that the complexities of the underlying communication protocols and access mechanisms The consistency of data is handled by the remote file system. If one process attempts to read a file while another process is attempting to write it, or two processes attempt to write the same file, the “read-write” and “write-write” conflicts are resolved by the underlying accessing mechanisms of remote file systems. FRB doesn’t implement consistency semantics in order to keep itself simple and high performance III  I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes the part of the implementation in detail Figure 2  The framework of FRB As shown in figure 2, the FRB system is composed of four modules: user interface, file provider, connection manager and naming service. User interface, file provider, connection manager make up the client, which is running on the user’s computer. We will describe the details of each module below A  User Interface The tasks of user interface are handling the user’s operation and feed back the result. It interacts with the user, converts the user’s operation to a group of commands, and does it through the interface provided by File Provider module The interface could be either graphic user interface or command line interface. A web interface could also be implemented, but the operations on local file system through a web browser are restricted by the operating system. Here we

  wrote a graphic user interface in Java, which is shown in figure 3 below Figure 3  The graphic user interface in Java This graphic user interface is composed of five parts   Local file resource view: on left-top and shows the file resource on local file system   Public file resource view: on left-middle and shows public file resources on remote file systems, which need no authentication before accessing   Private file resource view: on left-bottom and shows private file resource on remote file systems, which need an authentication before accessing   File list view: on right-top and shows detailed file information, such as file name, type, size, last modified time, etc   Task view: on right-bottom and shows the detailed status when the data of file resources is being accessed With the graphic user interface, users could visit heterogeneous file resource easily. This user interface is now used as the GUI of Corsair [1  a nd i t ha s  b e e n  d o w nl o a d e d over ten thousand times. It is used above 1900 times by users every day. The whole number of registered users in Corsair is 4215 at present B  Naming Service As described in section 2, file resources are organized into a tree. The tree is maintained by the naming service Naming service runs on a separate server and keeps the data of the user’s FRB tree. It communicates with the file provider module, receives the commands, does corresponding operations and returns the result. Naming service stores only the information of virtual file resources and FRBs. The information of each physical file resource can be generated from its parent, so with the information of a FRB node, all its children’s information can be generated Naming service also provides consistency semantic. If a user wants to change the FRB tree, the client must send the commands to the naming server and wait for the result. The naming server is unique globally, which ensures the consistency This implementation may cause the naming server to be the bottleneck of the system. Other architectures such as masterslave architecture or DNS redirection could be implemented to resolve this problem, but here we don’t implement it as the operations to change the FRB tree is not frequent C  File Provider The file provider is the primary module of this system. It provides a unified accessing interface for integrating heterogeneous file resources Figure 4  Architecture of File Provider As shown in figure 4, file provider can be divided into two levels: abstract interface and some file providers The abstract interface provides some common file accessing interfaces in Java. These interfaces, which are partly shown in table 1, can be divided into 3 types   Meta-data access interface. This file descriptor-based interface provides unified access to the meta-data of remote files. It permits the user to view and edit the meta-data of file resources   Data access interface. This interface is based on file stream. It provides an input/output stream for reading/writing a file. Read and write modes are provided as parameters of the interface   Naming manage interface. This interface permits the user to establish or remove mapping between virtual resource and physical resource TABLE I  T HE P ORTIONS OF ABSTRACT INTERFACE  Type Function Description Metadata access interface  getName Get the file’s name mkdir Create a directory rename Rename the file delete Delete the file getURL Get the file’s URL getPath Get the file’s path in FRB tree

Type Function Description Data access interface getInputStream Get an input stream of a file for reading file content getOutputStream Get an output stream of a file for writing the file Naming manage interface mount Map a physical resource to a virtual resource unmount Remove the mapping between the physical resource and the virtual resource  As shown above, there are three types of interfaces: metadata access interface, data access interface and naming manage interface. The first two types communicate with the physical storage devices which hold the file resources through connection managers, while the last one only communicates with the naming server Under the abstract interface is several file providers, each of which provides an implementation to access file resources of that type. Now we have implemented three types of file providers: local file providers, ftp file providers and http file providers. These types have covered most of the file resources on internet We implemented these file providers by accessing local file system and sending/receiving data by socket. We don’t choose to use some existing libraries because we need to make some optimizations to enhance the performance. For instance, we reuse the connections to transfer data in order to avoid too many connect and disconnect operations. This will be described below in section 3.4 Three file providers are described here: local file provider ftp file provider and http file provider The implementation of local file provider is easy, for local file system provide good support for file accessing. Every abstract interface can be implemented by invoking a local file system interface The implementation of ftp file provider is different. Instead of invoking an underlying interface, most of the abstract interfaces are implemented by sending commands and receiving replies. If data transfer is needed, a data connection will be established, which will be closed when all data has been transferred. If an error occurred, a corresponding exception will be thrown by this provider, which should be caught by the user interface TABLE II  T HE I MPLEMENTATION OF FTP  F ILE P ROVIDER  Function FTP Commands mkdir MKD rename RNFR, RNTO delete DELE getChildren LIST getInputStream RETR, REST Function FTP Commands getOutputStream STOR, APPE  The implementation of http file provider is almost the same as ftp file provider. Every abstract interface is implemented by sending requests and receiving responses. The meta-data and data are transferred through one connection. No extra connection is needed. If an error occurred, a corresponding exception will be thrown by http file provider. Unlike ftp, many file access operations such as renaming a file are not supported by http. If a file access operation is not supported, an exception will be thrown too There is a difference between local file provider and http/ftp file provider. The meta-data of http/ftp files is cached if the meta-data of a http/ftp file is accessed for the first time, it will be cached in memory. When next time the meta-data is accessed, there is no need to access the http/ftp server. Instead the cached meta-data will be returned Here we don’t go deep inside of the source code, but the source code is an important part to enhance the performance D  Connecttion Manager Connection manager can be seen as a delegate of all physical storage devices. It maintains a pool of connections to the remote storage sites. If a client wants to access some file resource on a remote sites, it must acquire a connection from connection manager firstly. If there is already a connection to the specific remote site, the manager will return it to the client else the manager will establish a new connection to the site and return this new connection. When a client finishes the data transferring, it does not close the connection immediately Instead, it just releases the connection and tries to put this connection back to the connection pool. To avoid establishing too many connections, the client will close the connection if a connection to the same site already exists in the pool. Under this mechanism, we can use the connections efficiently; as a result the performance is enhanced Connection manager also handles all the exceptions of connections. If a connection has never been used for a long time since its last usage, a timeout exception may be thrown This exception should be caught by connection manager instead of caught by user interface. Connection manager will try to reconnect and return the reconnected connection, so that the user interface doesn’t need to deal with the underlying timeout exception IV  E VALUATION  The experiments are setup as follows: three Intel Pentium machines \(Pentium IV 2.4 GHz, 1GB Memory\e used, one as the client, one as the naming server and one as a ftp server providing file resources. A FRB tree is built on the naming server, some FTP directories and files are mapped to the nodes of the tree. The time for listing and transferring all files is recorded. For comparison 002 we choose Commons VFS testing together

 Figure 5  The time of listing files Figure 5 shows that FRB can list files more quickly. The time of listing files spent by Commons VFS increase rapidly as the file number increases. This is because Commons VFS tries to resolve every file when listing files, so it takes a lot of time FRB only resolves a file when it is accessed Figure 6  The data transfer time for small files Figure 6 shows that FRB is more efficient than Commons VFS when transferring lots of small files. The data transfer time increases more rapidly than file number. It is because that an individual data connection needs to be established for each file, which takes much time Figure 7  The data transfer time of files with same total size Figure 7 also shows that FRB is more efficient than Commons VFS. With the number of files increases, the difference between FRB and VFS in performance is more obvious Besides, VFS has a lot of bugs which haven’t been fixed since now. For instance, the name of a file to be accessed shouldn’t have a whitespace character or ‘-‘. Some directories could not be resolved, etc. These make Commons VFS not convenient to use V  R ELATED W ORK  Many recent projects [4   6 8  9] ha ve t a c k l e d t h e problem of integrating heterogeneous file resource One of the most famous systems is SRB, which provides a hierarchical logical namespace to manage the organization of data. Although it is powerful, unfortunately it is not as simple as we wish. A lot of installation and configuration is required and several servers are needed to run the SRB service and MCAT service. This makes SRB not suitable for us Data Grid provides an integrating infrastructure for distributed computation, which is also a specialization and extension of the Grid [9 i s al so po w e r f ul a n d e ffi c i e n t   but  many services need to be installed before using it. This also makes Data Grid not easy-to-use Apache Commons VFS is a light-weight package for integrating heterogeneous file resource. It provides a single API for accessing various different file resources. But it fails under our test due to low performance. Besides, the usage of Commons VFS is not easy, and sometimes it makes us confused Both SRB and Commons VFS are designed for integrating heterogeneous file resources. Also there are some other systems or packages. But they are too heavy, too complex or low performance. Moreover, they are not suitable for us to research the optimization of file resource integrating system in future VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  We have described FRB, a light-weight, easy-to-use file integrating system. The emphases of our design are making the system simple and high performance. FRB provides the user a unified view and access interface of various heterogeneous file resources. It could be effectively used in the data grid and enterprises, and it could also be used by the developers to do further development. Now FRB has already been used in Corsair   a ca m p us d a t a  gr i d i n  T s i nghua U n i v er si t y  a nd provides part of the data accessing services At present, FRB is still a very initial one, and extra work is required to perfect it. Firstly, integrating more heterogeneous file resources, such as CIFS Error! Reference source not found files, is required. Another ongoing work is to provide searching service to help the user find a specific file resource quickly. Finally, we hope to do some more optimization to keep FRB simple when more types of file resources are integrated

  7  Figure 6. ABS Feature Results In this case, the fault was clear ly identified as a spall located on the inner race of the beari ng. Therefore, the inner race fault frequency would be expected to be a key piece of evidence for fault detection. Figure 7 provides the inner race fault feature trends obtai ned for the conventional and ImpactEnergy spectra  Figure 7. Effect of IE Processing on Detection Again, all feature values are normalized on a 0-1 scale While the conventional feature provides good indication of the progressed fault condition, the resulting detection threshold results in several cases of false alarms and missed detection. The feature value trend obtained after the signal processing process provides clear separation of the baseline incipient fault and progressed fault classes. As illustrated in the trend plot, thresholds can be created for this feature that provide fault detection without error as well as a fault severity assessment To further improve the performance of the inner race feature, feature fusion was used to combine the three best performing features into a single health index. Due to the small number of data samples available to refine the fused feature, a simple linear projection was created using principal component analysis \(PCA\s technique of linear algebra reduces data dimensionality while retaining the most critical information The resulting fused feature Figure 8\feature variance for each of the three classes than is observed in the inner race feature alone  Figure 8. Fused Feature Trend Plot Finally, sensor fusion was attempted to further enhance the fault response of the inner race feature. The bearing test rig collects sensor data in three locations. Two of these measurements are taken in close proximity to the test specimen. The third acceleromet er is located far from the test specimen in close proximity to another bearing. It is not expected that this distan t accelerometer would provide useful information about subtle faults present in the test bearing. All features presented so far were derived from the radial sensor near the specimen. To demonstrate sensor fusion, three techniques: beamforming, principal component analysis and the SUMPLE algorithm were applied to the time domain data from the two closest accelerometers The resulting feature trends obtained from data derived from each fusion technique are presented in Figure 9. The inner race feature extracted fro m the radial sensor only is provided for reference purposes   Figure 9. Inner Race Feature Sensor Fusion Results The results show that there was no observed benefit from sensor fusion using any of the three techniques. In this case the information gained from the axial sensor does not provide additional evidence of the fault condition. Note that the beamforming and SUMPLE results display the undesirable effect of a slight increase in feature variance These results demonstrate that the benefit of sensor fusion is

In this architecture, sensor measurements and operational parameters are input in real time. Data is preprocessed to reduce the effect of noise, before computing condition indicators or features indicative of a component\222s health Using the features and a model describing the component\222s degrading state, fault detection and failure prognostic algorithms based on particle filtering are applied [7 Statistical analysis is implemented to evaluate the probability of a fault being present. When the fault is detected with a given confidence level, the prognostic algorithm is activated to predict the remaining useful life RUL\he component. This architecture provides not only a convenient compromise between data-driven and model-based techniques, but also the means to evaluate performance with statistical indices. Moreover, the particle filtering based algorithm provides a means to deal efficiently with nonlinear and non-Gaussian noise. The nonlinear dynamic state model described by \(1\s used

  9 also important to note that this diagnostic framework allows for estimation of each of th e system\222s continuous-valued states as a probability density function \(pdf\The states are computed at the moment of fault detection, and provided as initial conditions to the prognostic routines, thus giving a suitable insight to the inherent uncertainty in the prediction problem When a fault is detected, the prognostic algorithm is activated. Prognosis may be understood as the result of the procedure where long-term \(multi-step\\226 describing the evolution in time of a fault indicator\226 are generated with the purpose of estimating the remaining useful life \(RUL\failing component/subsystem. Several approaches related to prognosis may be found in the literature. Few of them, however, offer appropriate tools for real-time estimation of the RUL as a continuous function of time A two-level procedure has been developed to address the failure prognosis problem. This procedure intends to reduce the uncertainty associated with long-term predictions by using the current state pdf es timate and a nonlinear dynamic state-space model. In the first level p step ahead predictions are generated based on an a priori estimate, adjusting their associated probabilities accord ing to the noise model structure. A second level uses these predictions and the definition of critical thresholds to estimate the RUL pdf also referenced to as the time-to-failure pdf When the prognosis algorithm is implemented, the pdf of fault detection is used as th e initial pdf to run the prognostic algorithm. The model for prognosis is developed using a Paris Law realtionship. For the bearings in focus, a fault is modeled as a quantified surface area of defect, denoted as D such that n DC d t dD D  0

As indicated earlier, 32 vibration snapshots are present in this data set, with 16 baseline \(healthy\ata points and eight poi nts from each of two \(spall Hence, 32 feature values are generated. To run failure prognosis, artificial data in-between these data points must be generated. The available vibration data correspond to different service hours. From these points, we interpolate the data according to service tim e in terms of minutes. This way, enough data points can be generated to run the failure prognosis algorithms. Figure 11 shows the ground truth data and times of available vibration snapshots. Interpolation of the ground truth points is used to assign spall sizes to the vibration snapshots. Figure 12 shows the time-based interpolation of feature values. From these two interpolations, we can estimate the expected feature values corresponding to different fault sizes and generate a feature progression curve as shown in Figure 13 Results of Failure Prognosis  Since the data is interpolated in terms of minutes, the RUL expectation and 95% confidence interval are also given in minutes. Long-term predictions are provided after fault is detected and using the current estimate for the state pdf as initial condition. Results are depicted in Figure 14 through Figure 16 Figure 14 shows the minute at which the fault is detected Before this time instant, the prognostic routines are disabled. As soon as the fault is detected, the pdf estimates at that time are used as the initial conditions for the prognostic routines, as shown in Figure 15. When a new measurement comes in, th e prognostic algorithms will provide an estimate of the remaining useful life.

  11 C ONCLUSIONS  This paper shows that enhancements to diagnostic techniques are desirable as well as attainable additions to Health and Usage Monitoring Systems \(HUMS particularly in the case of rotorcraft component monitoring Enhancements like those presented support CBM efforts primarily in two ways: reduce the sensitivity of diagnostic processes to both signal noise and variations in environmental and operating conditions, and improve the performance of detection systems as well as the task of fault identification \(e.g., severity quantification\ towards the instantiation of reliable prognostics Representative examples, motivat ed by the interest of the U.S. Army in transitioning from time-based \(using TBO definitions\o condition-based maintenance for an H-60 drive train bearing, illustrates the potential benefits of pursuing an integrated approach to diagnostics and prognostics, combining technologies for enhanced data preprocessing, advanced diagnostic-support algorithms, fusion at the sensor/feature levels, and an adequate framework for false alarm mitigation and uncertainty management. An architecture for achieving such in tegration is presented, with emphasis on supporting a robust performance of diagnostics operations, even in the presence of such kinds of disturbances as those observed in data acquired by HUMS vibration sensors. The present study also gives relevance to seeded fault\ testing of helicopter drive train components because the technologies disc ussed can integrate knowledge about damage mechanism interactions or physics-of-failure models, as well as make use of multiple-sensor and multiple-feature data sets re presentative of known fault conditions For this reason, the team behind this project is evaluating a potential opportunity to perform a series of tests on rotorcraft drive train bearings with varying fault severities and under multiple, though rea listic, operating conditions Such tests are being planned to provide algorithm/model validations, as well as diagnostic/prognostic performance assessments, in support of providing the U.S. Army with technologies that make detection systems more robust allow for the implementation of prognostics, and extend the useful life of drive train components. Component degradation testing thus remains as future, follow-up work to the research reported in this document A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work has been partially supported with a cooperative agreement by the Army Research Laboratory under contract number W911NF-07-2-0075.

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
