 I NTRODUCTION  It is more and more difficult to deal with big data and high concurrency data for traditional RDBMS in cloud 
storage. NoSQL database [1 h as be en po pu l a r in  cl ou d  storage, and document-oriented database also has attracted much attention as a kind of No SQL database. More and more organizations and enterprises de ploy their data in documentoriented database [2   Compared with a traditio nal RDBMS, a documentoriented database deals with high concurrency reading and writing very well, enables storage, accesses big data, and has high scalability and availability. Document-oriented database adopts agile document replacing the concept of tuple. The method of document-oriented embeds document or array in it and expresses the complex logical structures among data in 
a record. Furthermore, document-oriented database is schema-free database. The keys of document are not required and the orders of the keys are not fixed. The schema-free provides more operability for the data With the wide application of document-oriented database in the cloud storage, data security issues also emerge. Cloud data leakage occurs frequently in recent years, which makes the cloud storage providers lose credibility and increase the worry of the tenant about their dataês security. Cloud data leakage is generally divided into two cases, which are internal leakage and external leak age. Internal leakage refers 
to the cloud storage providerês staff stealing the tenantês data and selling it to the attacker to gain an advantage. External leakage refers to the attacker obtaining tenantês data through various channels, including attacks on the cloud servers and bribing the internal staff It is the research emphasis to prevent the tenantsê privacy data leakage in cloud data security. There have been some mature solutions to preserving privacy such as data encryption [3, 4  an on y m it y  5   6  7  an d  dat a f r agm e nt 8    etc D ata enc r y p ti on can  e ffectively prevent the leakage of privacy data, but the efficiency of the ciphertext 
processing is low; Anonymity protects privacy data through generalization. The generalization has acceptable processing efficiency, but it may result in data loss. Data fragment separates attributes which would leak tenantsê privacy together into distinct table and hide the relation among the tables. Data fragment doesnêt loss data, whose executing efficiency is better than data encryption, but it is not applicable for the structure of document Considering the traditional methods canêt protect tenants privacy data while guaranteeing efficiency, we present a document-oriented database-based privacy data protection architecture which protects tenantsê privacy through split 
value and confused key. To pr event the attacker recombining the split value, we provide the theory of matching degree and give related definition 000V 
and algorithm to decrease the possibility of exposing tenantsê privacy data. Our architecture can protect tenantês data from internal leakage and external leakage and maintain the properties as schemefree and nested document of document-oriented database Finally we test and verify ou r architecture is practical In section 003 we present the basic method to protect privacy data. In section 003

Definition 1. Split Value and Confused Key, split value means segmenting the value of the attribute which needs protect. V Confused key is concurrent with split value, then we would rename every key of split value and out of order of the keys, K  We can insure accuracy of ev ery key-value pair and existing constraints while the order of confused key is the privacy protecting method Scheme-free is a feature of document-oriented database which means the order of the keys and the length of values are not fixed. We assume the attributes which need protect have a maximum length and a minimum length. We would determine the number of confused key by the maximum length when we achieve the privacy protecting method while the large data is not considered in this paper We need know split granular ity when we split value and confuse key. The split granularity would determine the level of the privacy protection. We named this split granularity as split factor. The bigger of the split factor, the lower of the privacy protection level. If the split factor is 1, then we can regard our method as a special encryption algorithm. We would verify the efficiency of our architecture with different split factor Nested Document is regarding a document as a value of another document. Nested documen t structure is a feature of document-oriented database, wh ich makes the data organize more naturally and more accurately. We must consider how to protect the data in nested document carefully when we protect the privacy data in document-oriented database To protect the data in nested document, we need grasp the structure information of the full-document. Therefore, we generate document-tree. The root of the document-tree is the record, while we build hierarchical relationship of the tree as the document structureês hierarchical relationship. The document which contains value would become leaf node there is a leaf node as successor for every leaf node. And we donêt care the orders of the key in document, in other words our document-tree supports scheme-free. There contains three extra-properties for every leaf node, the type of the value \(0: numerical value, 1: string value\, the maximum length and the minimum length Attribute age is a numerical value and the min length is 1 and the max length is 3. The type of value and min length are used in compute matching degree which are mentioned in next section, and the max attribute is used to determine the number of renamed key in confused key We can obtain the path of the document through document-tree.Privacy method wo uld hold the path when we split an attribute III M ATCHING D EGREE   We have defined the basic privacy data protection method for document-oriented database. The attacker canêt obtain tenantsê privacy data directly after split value and confused key, but they still could get tenantsê privacy information through piece together and specialized knowledge. For example, although it has split attribute SSN if the attacker has already known the value of the first two field, they only need try two possible way that must contains tenantsê privacy data. The specialized knowledge reduces the level of tenantsê privacy data protection very much Therefore, we present the definition of matching degree We give the definition of the knowledge of attacker Definition 2, Awareness Ex pression\(AE\ress the knowledge of the attacker for a certain attribute where item represents the segmentation that attacker knows the location of it that we denominate as known segmentation; item represents the location of a segmentation that attacker cannot ensure that we denominate as suspicious segmentation. The knowledge of the attacker is the combination of all the known segmentation and a certain suspicious segmentation Take the phone number as an example, The top numbers usually signify the regions; it is easy to distinguish through the yellow pages. The attacker could position the order of the early segmentations by the knowledge of phone number and these segmentations are known as segmentation. The segmentations which other attackers canêt make sure their order are suspicious segmentation After defining the knowledge of the attacker we can define privacy leakage exponent. Privacy leakage exponent is the indicator to measure the level of the privacy protection of our architecture Definition 3, Privacy Leakage Exponent \(PLE the lower the PLE is, the harder for attacker to achieve tenantsê privacy data Definition 4, Match Degree \(MD\expresses the closeness degree of two attribute. For matching attribute \002 and matched attribute \003  is privacy attribute of tenant T expresses the type of the attribute, then we assume only two types of the attributes which are number and string expresses the minimum length of the attribute. Attributes can only match with the same type and the MD of attributes with different types are

We donêt hide other properties of attribute when an attribute is anonymous It is possible that the protected attribute is the matching attribute of other attribute, or the found matching attribute has been becoming matching attribute of other attributes. We call these scenarios as multi-matching and the algorithm only needs split the attribute not anonymous IV

zero. The lengthier the matchin g attribute than the matched attribute, the higher MD. E.g. the MD of attributes SSN and firstname is 0 Definition 5, Matching Split Policy, for the attribute of tenant, find attribute with max MD, and split and  together, get n and m segmentations were the matching split policy The matching split policy can ensure the PLE less than if the attacker only have the knowledge of one attribute Prove, assume attacker has specialized knowledge of an attribute of tenants, if we split this attribute to n segmentations, and split the matching attribute to m segmentations, then according to the definition of AE, the attacker could mostly certain n-2 known segmentations, in other words, there are less than m+2 suspicious segmentations. According to the definition of MD, the max PLE of tenant is As so the PLE of tenant is less than  There are two method of split value, split fixed length and split fixed segmentation number. Split fixed length means the segmentations length were same for a certain attribute. Split fixed segmentation number means the segmentations number were same for all the attributes. We adopt fixed length split in our architecture because it can produce the best possible results within matching degree We have present matching degree and matching spilt policy which can reduce the pos sibility of the leakage of tenantsê data. We present alg orithm about achieve matching policy. This algorithm can get the optimum matching attribute of the protected attribute We compute the matching degree of attributes through document tree. For the attribute that need achieve matching attribute, the algorithm traverse all leaf node from it and compute the matching degree with it. The attribute with max matching degree will be found an d we will hide the name of the two attributes and send their path in matching policy. The algorithm would traverse the document tree twice and the time complexity is O\(n TABLE I  1 find privacy attribute A in  2  canêt find A  3  5  node in  6   compute Matching Degree with A 7  8.  find maximum Matching Degree attribute B 9  B has hided  10  K A 001\025 splitValue\(A  11 save Aês fullname in K A  12 anonymity Aêname in K A  14  splitValue\(A B 001\025 splitValue\(B  1 6  save A and Bês fullname in K A and K B  1 7.   anonymity A and Bêname in K A and K B  19 P RIVACY P ROTECT A RCHITECTURE  The early chapters describe the method to achieve privacy protection policy, and the policy itself also becomes a sensitive data. Especially it h as fatalness of leakage when the privacy policy and the protected data are saved together We present document-oriented database privacy protection architecture to prevent that The architecture has two types of servers: P-server and Sservers. S-servers store protected data only, whereas P-server stores tenantsê policy, receives incoming operations, and verifies the tenantês identity and translates the operation according to the policy. P-server can only receive and translate tenantsê operation request, and cannot send operation request itself 0003\000\020\0006\000H\000U\000Y\000H\000U  tenantês secret key PK and the saved operation request

Tenants own the secret key and would send the secret key at the request of the operation. P-server deciphers tenantês policy through the secret key. All of these are in memory and are not persistent When tenants want to insert data, they will send the request which contains tenantês identity information

CRUD Operation \(ms For the insert operation, we insert same 100w records into the database respectively and we could observe that no more than 5% is affected by our architecture. For the query operation, the three database return same result set, but the efficiency of operation would go lower along with the number of protected attribute. The operation time of database C has almost increased 20% compared with the time of database A. While for the update and delete operation, the architecture almost does not affect their effiency Efficiency of Split Factor 002 ms 002  We can see from the result of experiment that the split factor has affected on insert and query operation. Especially for the select operation, the operation time of database D has almost increased 25% compared with the time of database A while for the insert operation the effect is less than 10%. We need consider the executing efficiency and the protection level in product environment A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61272241, the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China under Grant No. ZR2010FQ026, Independent Innovation Foundation of Shandong University under Grant No.2012TS074.

The P-server verifies tenantês identity, then gets tenantês policy through deciphering function and translates module split the data to and sends it to S-server. Sservers receive the operation request and save the data V E XPERIMENT  The experiment compares the efficiency of CRUD operation when using architecture with not using it. Besides it verifies the query efficiency with different split factor. We use mongoDB 2.2[10 as th e  test d a t a base an d d e ploy it  on  three servers with two 1.80GHz quad-core CPU, 8GB memory and 1TB storage space. The operation system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux6.2. The scale of the test dataset is 100w It is possible that the protected attribute is the matching attribute of other attribute, or the found matching attribute has been becoming matching attribute of other attributes. We call these scenarios as multi-matching and the algorithm only needs split the attribute not anonymous The experiment has built three database. Database A stores raw data; database B protects attribute data_date and the coll_time becomes matching attribute; database C protects attributes data_date and coll_time and coll_time becomes the multi-matching attribute. All the operation of the three databases is same in the experiment. The results are shown as figure 2  Figure 2 The experiment has verified the query efficiency with different split factor and has built three databases. Database A stores the raw data; database B and D protect attribute data_date and the coll_time becomes matching attribute Database B split the attribute with 4 bytes a key or rather split factor is 4 and database Dês split factor is 8. All the operation of the three databases is same in the experiment The results are shown as figure 3  Figure 3

In Re ynolds suggests that the data source selection process should be selective in terms of the data needed Given the scale of the data handled by the knowledge cubes architecture the proposed suggestion by Reynolds aligns with knowledge cubes Reynolds suggests two types of vocabularies to express the data 1 Link vocabulary to provide a common representation for links and 2 Imprecise value vocabulary to provide a common representation for common vocabulary Given the knowledge cubes architecture the vocabulary proposal by Reynolds can be a viable solution where each cube includes its own vocabulary However we need to allow for cross-talk e.g by maintaining relations among existing vocabulary terms from the various vocabularies and providing enough provisioning in order for the relations to still hold The spatial and temporal dimensions of the knowledge cube data form a rich facility in solving some uncertainty challenges For example we can disambiguate two named entities if both belong to the same spatial location or time slot C Challenge 3 Data Partitioning Scheme Deìning an efìcient scheme for partitioning depends on the semantics of the data For example speciìc snapshots of the data may mandate that the data be partitioned according to the named entities contained in the data Another scheme might see that partitioning based on people who are politicians or soccer players might generate a good scheme More sophisticated schemes might involve both entities and relations or a combination of both An important aspect to consider is how big the data is given each scheme and whether there is a form of overlapping among the generated partitions We believe that the data is the main driver of the partitioning scheme Employing some form of data analysis over the acquired data may reveal interesting properties that can aid in deìning efìcient partitioning schemes For example semantic relationships can be learned in an unsupervised fashion from the search queries and their results This means that the statistics gathered based on user queries can be an asset that aids in identifying an efìcient partitioning scheme In turn this requires that the system starts with an initial scheme that can evolve over time based on gathered statistics D Challenge 4 Storage and Indexing The database and semantic web communities have a number of solutions for storing and querying Linked Data ranging from centralized to distributed data stores W e describe four main categories that have been adopted by both communities and discuss the challenges associated with each of them The rst category called Triplestores stores RDF triples in a single relational table The attributes speciìed are either triples subject predicate object or quadruples subject predicate object context Even though disk space for Triplestores is not a major concern in terms of size a real concern is in maintaining a reasonable RAM and database ratio which is exempliìed in the case of Big Data scale The second category is vertically-partitioned tables where systems maintain a table per property as many triple patterns have xed properties One variation is to use a column store that captures the column entries of the same type The objective is to avoid reading an entire row into memory in the event that only a few attributes are accessed per query This approach has scalability problems when the number of properties in an RDF is high 23 The study in 22 23 suggests that Triplestores outperform the vertically-partitioned approach when having a larger number of properties The third category is schema-speciìc systems that capture subjects with overlapping properties These systems have a query processing advantage as the subjects may be accessed together In  Le v andoski and Mokbel claim that property tables can outperform Triplestores and vertically-partitioned tables for RDF data One concern is the storage overhead because subjects may contain multiple objects The second and third categories also raise an important concern regarding the increased cost of integration quality An open question is Which of the three categories is best suited for embodying the semantic aspects proposed by the knowledge cubes architecture One proposed direction is to adopt all three categories and apply the most optimum based on the current semantics of the data This step occurs as the knowledge cube evolves over time Deìning a suitable index over the data is also a crucial challenge An index may need to include spatial temporal relational or textual aspects An advantage of knowledge cubes is that the index would be deìned over well-structured information with rich semantics In turn this aids in deìning a more meaningful indexing structure The structural integrity of the index would also affect the query processing performance E Challenge 5 Communication among Cubes There are many forms of communication in knowledge cubes One is when a cube needs to know further information about a query that it is processing Another is when a cube needs to be updated about what other cubes have Deìning an efìcient communication protocol that considers the overhead of contacting and retrieving content from other knowledge cubes is vital Knowledge cubes may co-exist on the same machine i.e embedded communication or on separate machines i.e stand-alone A knowledge cube should be intelligent enough to decide when to cache content that it usually retrieves from other knowledge cubes In turn this should signiìcantly decrease the communication overhead Adaptive Replacement Cache ARC is one candidate algorithm that can be used to keep track of frequently used and recently used data It can also be used to maintain historical data regarding eviction for both scenarios A challenge would be to see if the algorithm will adapt to both data and structural evolution of the knowledge cube F Challenge 6 Spatial and Temporal Extraction Published articles or web pages will need to be segmented into individual units of information termed statements For each statement we need to identify the topic of the statement 


the subject the person the event the time interval or the location that this statement is about who authored the sentence where and when this statement is made and whether that statement is extracted from some other internet source etc For example in the time dimension we need to capture two notions of time for a given statement 1 when that statement is published or written i.e its transaction time and 2 when the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid time The same applies for the space dimension Two space dimensions need to be extracted 1 the physical location of the person who published the statement i.e the statementês transaction location and 2 the location where the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid location The same is true for the person who wrote the statement and the person that the statement states facts about etc G Challenge 7 Data Change Frequency It is important to identify when a knowledge cube updates its Linked Data Linked Data is very dynamic in nature where its resources are added removed or updated very frequently especially in the Web of Data Therefore it is important to investigate measures of freshness for the content and interlinked resources For example the Linked Data of the cube may indicate certain properties for triples that might conîict with others that are later retrieved as new data Identifying these conîicts and creating policies of how to handle them is a crucial issue Adding provenance can be one solution to this issue However it raises another question of what version of the data to present as an answer to the query A study by Umbrich et al identiìes the characteristics of change over Linked Data and compares the change frequency in the Web of Data versus the traditional Web HTML documents  VII C ONCLUSION We present a vision for the knowledge cube architecture that motivates understanding the semantics of the data as a means for solving some of the research challenges we face today speciìcally in Big Data We motivate the use of Linked Data as a mean for achieving this target given the rich semantics that Linked Data provides We present a strawman design that sketches the possible components of a knowledge cubes system Each presented component conveys a high-level overview about its potential usage scenarios We illustrate some of the challenges and potential solutions associated with the knowledge cubes proposal Finally we demonstrate how the proposed architectural components can be used to tackle the ve pillars of Big Data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
