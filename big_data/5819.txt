An Analysis of Treatment Patterns A Case Study on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Ching Lien and Silvia Figueira Department of Computer Engineering Santa Clara University Santa Clara, CA 95053-0566, US clien;sfigueira}@scu.edu  Abstract   Workersê compensation is a form of medical insurance provided by employers to their employees. Workers compensation databases have a complete picture of each case including treatments, treatment costs, and treatment duration and analyzing their data can be extremely helpful to identify patterns and possibly determine the correlation between diseases and treatments and also the correlation between 
different treatments. These correlations have several benefits including the decrease in insurance costs, by making the process of authorization more accurate and less wasteful.  Also patterns enable prediction, which may help insurance companies to estimate costs and to detect irregularities and/or special cases, which may last longer or consume more resources. One problem in analyzing such data is the fact that medical information is not precise, e.g., different codes can be used for similar procedures. However, although not precise the relationship between diseases and treatments seem to have some consistency, which might enable the correlation. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing workers 
compensation data to obtain information on correlation among diseases, treatments and expected costs.  We present a study on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome to show that consistency enables prediction and the development of guidelines for treatment authorization Keywords-association rules, temporal patterns, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome I   I NTRODUCTION  Workersê compensation is a form of medical insurance provided by employers to their employees.  Typically, after an employee is injured at work, the employee is examined by a medical professional, who requests appropriate treatments Once these requests are certified, patients receive medical 
treatments.  The treatments may last for some time until the employee recovers.  At the end, insurance companies and employers share the medical costs. The interesting fact about workersê compensation is the fact that each case is entirely coordinated by one entity Considering that workerês compensation databases have a complete picture of each case, including treatments treatment costs, and treatment duration, analyzing their data can be extremely helpful to identify patterns and possibly determine the correlation between diseases and treatments and also the correlation between different treatments. These correlations have several benefits, including the decrease in insurance costs, by making the certification process more 
accurate and less wasteful.  Also, patterns enable prediction which may help insurance companies to estimate costs, and to detect irregularities and/or special cases, which may last longer or consume more resources To determine these correlations, we propose a method for analyzing workersê compensation data and identifying patterns.  We demonstrate our method by analyzing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome cases. A popular data mining technique association-rule mining, is applied to find patterns in the data set.  Association-rule mining was introduced in [1 b y  Agrawal et al, and is widely used in the analysis of retail transactions or modeling of purchase behaviors.  The goal of 
association-rule learning is to discover meaningful relationships among a set of transaction items. The most popular algorithm for mining association rules is Apriori [2 which is used in our experiments Association-rule learning is a well-researched topic which has been used in many domains, including medical databases.  For mining medical billing data, the authors in [3 apply the Apriori algorithm to discover rules between diagnosis and treatments. In [4  th e au th o r  in t r o d u c es an  algorithm that uses constrains to reduce the number of rules searches for association rules on a training set, and finally validates them on an independent test set.  However the 
relationships among medical treatments remain unaddressed in these papers.  Since the data set consists of patients treatment records, it would be meaningful to find sequential patterns. In [5 th e au th ors ex tra ct tim ean n o tat e d s e qu en ces  to help assessing the effectiveness of a therapy using their own mining software, but they do not provide details on the algorithm used.  In this paper, we apply the Apriori algorithm to discover not only association rules but also association rules related to time for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome cases, which is the most common reported diagnose in workersê compensation injuries This paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 presents 
the methodology.  Section 3 explains the experimental setup Section 4 describes our results.  Section 5 shows the significance of the findings to the insurance industry Section 6 concludes II  METHODOLOGY  A  Grouping Since different types of patients present different patterns, in order to identify those patterns, it is necessary to partition patients into groups.  We tried to partition patients into 3 groups based on the total amount spent, but the

patterns were not obvious compared to those patterns found if patients were grouped according to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, the most expensive treatment.  Therefore we divided patients in two groups: NS, non surgery patients and S, surgery patients.  However, the distribution of surgery patientsê total spending has two peaks which imply two sub-groups.  Therefore we further divided the surgery group into 2 sub-groups according to patientsê total spending: LCS, low-cost surgery patients, and HCS, highcost surgery patients B  Running the Apriori Algorithm After partitioning patients into groups, the next step is to run the Apriori algorithm in order to come up with frequent treatments and co-occurrences of treatments.  Cooccurrences enable automatic authorization C  Adding Time Notation to Data Items To find association rules related with time, we add timestamps to data items.  In our experiment, each entry is time-stamped since the date of service and the date of injury provide the month the treatment was performed after injury which we attach to the treatment.  For example, a given patientês treatment list before adding time notation may be physical therapy, physical therapy assessment, Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, and anesthesiaé.  The list shows the treatments this given patient ever had.  It consists of treatments without duplicates.  Now after attaching time notation, the treatment list might become çphysical therapy 0\ysical therapy assessment \(0\sical therapy \(1 Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery \(2\, anesthesia \(2\, physical therapy \(3\ysical therapy \(4\physical therapy \(5\d physical therapy \(6\he number in the parenthesis indicates in which month the patient performed such treatment.  Therefore this patient had sessions of physical therapy in his/her first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh month D  Running the Apriori Algorithm Again When each treatment is time annotated, the next step is to run the Apriori algorithm again to uncover cooccurrences of treatments.  Since treatments are time annotated, it is easy to see the duration of a treatment and the sequence of treatments, which enable the identification of anomalies  III  E XPERIMENTAL SETUP  In our experiment, association rules are mined from reallife medical data sets to uncover the most frequent treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, to reveal the relationships among treatments, and to understand the evolution of treatments for the disease.  Note that results are obtained with minimum medical knowledge A  Tools and Data Preparation We used a statistical computing software environment, R 6  R i s a f r e e  l a ngua ge and s o ft w a r e e nvi ro nm e n t for statistical computing.  It provides various statistical techniques and can produce statistical graphs.  Besides package arules [7  i s l o ade d i n t o R w h e n r unni ng t h e A p ri or i  algorithm.  Package arules is a computational environment specialized in analyzing transaction data and patterns, and it was used to mine frequent itemsets and association rules in our experiment Data was provided by a workersê compensation management company.  Before data was passed to the research team, all personal information was removed.  In order to focus on the disease, i.e., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome data sets were filtered based on the International Classification of Disease \(ICD\ codes.  There are approximately 13,000 records of claims for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from year 2006 to 2008.  A record consists of the following fields: entry id, patient id, treatment, service date and injury date.  Entry id and patient id are used for differentiating records and patients. Treatment is used as both the antecedent and consequent of rules.  Service date is the date the patient had the treatment.  Injury date is the date the patient was injured.  Note that the injury date is not precise since patients might not recall the date they were injured B  Definitions Basically, the goal of association-rule mining is to discover the co-occurrence of two events and describe it in a simple, probabilistic way.  For example, A and B are two events, and A and B have nothing in common.  The pattern is defined as: if A occurs, then B will also occur with probability p.  Or we can put it: A 002 B In our experiment, we use the standard definition of association rules [1  Le t I   i 1 i 2 i m be a set of distinct items, and D = {T 1 T 2 T n be a set of transactions.  D is a transaction database over I.  A subset of I containing k distinct items is called a k-itemset.  Let X and Y be two itemsets, X, Y 002 I, and X Y = {}.  An association rule is an implication denoted as X 002 Y, where X is called antecedent and Y consequent of the rule.  The size of a rule is the total number of items in X and Y.  In order to select interesting rules among possible rules, two important measures are utilized: support and confidence.  Consider an itemset Z, support\(Z\ is defined as the fraction of rows that satisfy Z in D.  In other words, support\(Z\s P\(Z\.  The support of a rule X 002 Y, support\(X 002 Y\ is defined as support \(X Y\  Confidence is defined as accuracy.  Given two itemsets, X and Y, confidence\(X 002 Y\efined as the fraction of rows that satisfy Y among those rows which also satisfy X.  Therefore, confidence\(X 002 Y support\(X Y\/support\(X\ = P\(Y|X The problem of association-rule mining is defined as finding all rules {X 002 Y} such that support\(X 002 Y\ \002 \003 and confidence \(X 002 Y\ \002 \004, given a set of items I, a transaction database D over I, support threshold \003, and confidence threshold \004

IV  A  C ASE S TUDY   W ORKERS   C OMPENSATION AND C ARPAL T UNNEL S YNDROME  We want to discover rules related to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery due to the fact that such surgery is more expensive than other treatments.  These results can be helpful in treatment authorization requests and payment decisions for patients who have the disease A  Carpal Tunnel Syndrom e Patients Overall 1  Description Statistics We loaded the arules package in the R environment and read the patientsê data.  We found that there were 443 distict patients and 330 different treatment codes in total  The top five most frequent treatments are in Table 1 The most frequent treatment is required reports.  This matches our expectation.  After employees are injured, they go to doctors who need to file reports with claims.  Doctors may also need to submit reports after treatments, for example, surgery.  Doctors might try some treatments to help patients relieve their pain, such as therapeutic procedure and myofascial release, which are the second and third most frequent treatments.  Myofascial release is a manual massage technique with the goal of relieving pain and increasing the range of motion a co mm o n t r e a t m e nt for Car pa l  T unne l  Syndrome patients.  The fourth most frequent treatment is office visit \(established patient\ since employees visit doctors regularly during the treatments.  The fifth most frequent treatment, application of a modality, is a type of physical therapy which aims at relieving patientsê pain 2  Association Rules Related to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery The reason why we focus on Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery \(Neuroplasty and/or transposition; median nerve at carpal tunnel\ that there were 125 \(28%\ts performing this surgery with a total amount spent of 281,228.59 \(26% of the sum of all patientsê spending The average cost of such surgery is $2,249.83.  This is a relatively expensive treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome patients and is reserved for the most severe patients after trying weeks of non-surgical treatments.  We were interested only in association rules in which Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery is either the antecedent or consequent of the rule and, for simplicity, the size of the rule is limited to 2.  Our support threshold is 0.1 and confidence threshold is 0.8.  Rules with Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, as antecedent are in Table 2 and, as consequent, are in Table 3 respectively Rule \(Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery 002 Required reports\ means that patients who have surgery will have 89 of chance to be asked to file reports.  This makes sense because, after surgery, doctors who perform the surgery usually need to submit some reports with the claim.  For the rule \(Anesthesia 002 Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery anesthesia is for all procedures on nerves, muscles, tendons fascia, and bursae of forearm, wrist, and hand.  This rule implies that if a patient has such anesthesia, the chance for him/her to have the surgery is 84%.  It also makes sense since performing the surgery requires anesthesia on that hand TABLE I  5  M OST F REQUENT T REATMENTS FOR C ARPAL T UNNEL S YNDROME P ATIENTS   Treatment Number of incidences per patient Total amount spent overall spending Average cost per patient 1 Required reports 1,495 \(3.37 17,248.03\(2 11.54 2 Therapeutic procedure 1,317 \(2.97 33,545.43\(3 25.47 3 Myofascial release 1,194\(2.70\ 46,813.11\(4%\ 39.21 4 Office visit, est patient 864 \(1.95 46,113.81\(4 53.37 5 Application of a modality to 1 or more areas 811 \(0.18 6,831.65\(1 8.42 B  Divide Patients into 3 Groups and Find Association Rules for Each Group To simplify the process, çoffice visité and çrequired reportsé treatments are removed since they do not contain meaningful treatment information From this point on, we divide patients into 3 groups: Non Surgery \(NS\ patients, Low-Cost-Surgery \(LCS\patients who spent less than $5,500, and High-Cost-Surgery \(HCS patients who spent more or equal to $5,500.  Figure 1 shows the distribution of the total amount spent by surgery patients There are two peaks, indicating 2 sub-groups in the surgery group, and between the two peaks is a dent which is between 5,500 and $6,000.  Therefore we partition surgery patients accordingly.  Those who spent less than $5,500 are LowCost-Surgery \(LCS\atients, and those who spent equal to or more than $5,500 are High-Cost-Surgery \(HCS\ patients We find there are 255 NS patients, 84 LCS patients, and 41 HCS patients.  63 patients are excluded because they had only çoffice visité or çrequired reportsé treatments TABLE II  C ARPAL T UNNEL R ELEASE S URGERY AS AN A NTECEDENT  Antecedent Consequent Support Confidence 1 Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery Required reports 0.25 0.89 TABLE III  C ARPAL T UNNEL R ELEASE S URGERY AS A C ONSEQUENT  Antecedent Consequent Support Confidence 1 Anesthesia Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery 0.19 0.84

 Figure 1  Histogram of surgery patientsê sum 1  NS Patients a  Description Statistics The five most frequent treatments are in Table 4 below.  The most frequent treatment is physical therapy which makes sense since these patients feel the pain so physicians try physical therapy to help relieve their pain.  From the second to the fourth most frequent treatments are diagnostic exams: nerve conduction which is a test that reveals the nature of nerve injury needle electromyography, which is a diagnostic test çused by physicians to determine neuromuscular disorders and diseases such as Lou Gehrigês disease and Carpal Tunnel Syndrom d radiolo g i c ex a m  h a n d or w r i s t a  common non-invasive inexpensive exam.   Patients may use wrist-hand orthosis to restrict their hand movement before or after surgery b  Association Rules for NS Patients There are 4 rules for non surgery patients as shown in Table 5 below.  It is clear that in this case physicians perform some diagnostic exams or tests, such as physical therapy assessment, needle electromyography, and nerve conduction, together with or without prescribing physical therapy TABLE IV  5  M OST F REQUENT T REATMENTS FOR NS  P ATIENTS  Treatment Number of incidences per patient Total amount overall spending Average cost per patient 1 Physical therapy 1,326 5.2 30,918.06 \(11 23.31 2 Nerve conduction 834\(3.27 103,577.12 39 124.19 3 Needle electromyography 106 \(0.42 15,611.25 \(6 147.28 4 Radiologic exam hand or wrist 76 \(0.30 3,088.10 \(1 40.63 5 Wrist hand orthosis 57 \(0.22 4,076.31 \(2 71.51    TABLE V  A SSOCIATION R ULES FOR NS  P ATIENTS  Antecedent Consequent Support Confidence 1 Physical therapy assessment Physical therapy 0.15 0.97 2 Needle electromyography Nerve conduction 0.36 1.0 3 Nerve conduction Physical therapy assessment Physical therapy 0.06 1.0 4 Needle electromyography Physical therapy Nerve conduction 0.08 1.0  2  LCS Patients  These are patients who had at least one Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery and spent less than $5,500 in total.  There are 84 patients in this group a  Description Statistics The five most frequent treatments are in Table 6 below.  The most frequent treatment is physical therapy, which is prescribed by physicians to help relieve pain.  Since patients have surgery most of the time they will need anesthesia as shown in the third and fourth most frequent treatments.  The second and fifth treatments are diagnostic tests: nerve conduction and physical therapy assessment b  Association Rules for LCS Patients We set the support threshold to 0.3 and show the association rules in Table 7.  Since every patient in this group has one or more surgeries, the first rule says çeveryone here has surgery which is true.  Patients may use wrist-hand orthosis to restrict their hand movement before or after surgery Patients may also have diagnostic exams, such as nerve conduction and physical therapy assessment, before surgery as shown in rules #4 and #5.  It is clear that physicians may perform physical therapy assessment before or after sessions of physical therapy and perform both before surgery, as shown in rules #8 and #9.  It seems necessary for most patients to have anesthesia during surgery, as shown in rule 6.  Patients may also have physical therapy before or after surgery to relieve their pain, as shown in rule #7.  Since anesthesia and surgery are performed at the same time, it is obvious that physical therapy is performed before or after both treatments, as shown in rule #10 TABLE VI  5  M OST F REQUENT T REATMENTS FOR LCS  P ATIENTS  Treatment Number of incidences per patient Total amount overall spending Average cost per patient 1 Physical therapy 1,638\(19.5 36,387.38 \(14 22.21 2 Nerve conduction 174 \(2.07 24,254.86 \(9 139.39 3 Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery 147\(1.75\ 142,042.43\(54%\996.28 4 Anesthesia 62 \(0.74 12,334.52 \(5 198.94 5 Physical therapy assessment 44 \(0.52 1,822.67\(1 41.42   5500

These frequent treatments are similar to LCS patients with only one treatment different which is the fourth most frequent treatment, INDIVID PROCEDURE REQ CUMPUTER EQUIP.  From the most frequent treatment to the third most frequent treatment, they are the same: physical therapy, nerve conduction and Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  The fifth most frequent treatment is anesthesia which comes along with surgery b  Association Rules for HCS Patients The support threshold is 0.5 and we have the following association rules in Table 9.  Since every patient in this group had at least one Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, the first rule says çeveryone here has surgeryé, which is true.  88% of these patients have physical therapy and 83% have anesthesia.  In rules #4 and 5, patients who have physical therapy may also have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery and vice versa.  Patients have physical therapy before or after surgery.  It is also clear that patients who have anesthesia are those patients who have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgeries but not every surgery patient will have anesthesia, as shown in rules #6 and #7 These rules can explain the relation between physical therapy and anesthesia \(rules #8 and #9\ treatments are related to surgery, as shown in rule #10.  Patients may also have diagnostic exams, such as nerve conduction and physical therapy assessment before surgery, as shown in rules #11 and #13. Physicians may evaluate patients condition before or after their sessions of physical therapy to see if these treatments are right for them, as shown in rule 12.  If the patientês condition is still serious and does not respond to treatments according to physiciansê evaluation Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery is the last resort to heal Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

4  Comparison of Treatments among NS Patients, LCS Patients, and HCS Patients It is clear that patients with a more severe condition tend to receive more treatments than those with a less severe condition.  Non-surgery patients tend to have physical therapy to relieve their pain and diagnostic exams to evaluate their condition.  Since their condition is not serious, there is no need for Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  On the other hand, some patients after sessions of physical therapy or other non-surgical treatments, which did not relieve their pain,  have surgery to fix the problem.  In practice, a package for just injured patients may contain diagnostic exams to evaluate their conditions, such as physical therapy assessment, nerve conduction, and needle electromyography, and sessions of physical therapy.  If the condition is serious or sessions of physical therapy do not help, the patients may be automatically authorized for a surgery package which may include Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery, anesthesia, and after-surgery physical therapy sessions  C  Association Rules Related with Time 1  Basic Idea If we want to find association rules related with time, one possible way is to add time stamps to data items.  In our experiment, each treatment entry is timestamped.  Since each treatment has a date of service and a date of injury, we can obtain the month performed after injury and attach it to the treatment.  Then these timeannotated entries are processed and analyzed by the Apriori algorithm to discover time-bas ed association rules.  Since these rules are related to time, we will present them in patterns instead of antecedent and consequent pairs 2  Temporal Patterns for NS Patients The patterns are shown in Table 10.  NS patients usually have their physical therapy assessment when they have their first physical therapy, as seen in patterns #1, #2 and #7.  They may also have other diagnostic exams, such as needle electromyography and nerve conduction, but still these exams are performed when they have their first physical therapy, in rules #5 and #6.  Rule #8 says that needle electromyography and nerve conduction are usually performed together in the first 8 months.  Patients tend to have their physical therapy assessment and physical therapy on their first, third, seventh, or eighth month, as shown in rule #9, which means patients tend to start their physical therapy sessions in these months              TABLE X  T EMPORAL P ATTERNS FOR NS  P ATIENTS  Patterns Frequency 1 Physical therapy\(0,1,2\, Physical therapy assessment\(0 1.6 2 Physical therapy\(0,1,6\, Physical therapy assessment\(0 1.2 3 Physical therapy\(0,1,2 2.3 4 Physical therapy\(0,1,6 1.2 5 Physical therapy\(0\, Needle electromyography\(0\,Nerve conduction\(0 1.2 6 Physical therapy\(1\, Needle electromyography\(1\,Nerve conduction\(1 1.2 7 Physical therapy\(1,2\, Physical therapy assessment\(1 1.6 8 Needle electromyography and Nerve conduction}\(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 1.2 9 Physical therapy and Physical therapy assessment}\(0,2,6,7 1.2  3  Temporal Patterns for LCS Patients Table 11 exhibits the temporal patterns for LCS patients.  Some patterns are similar to those found for NS patients.  For example, according to patterns #6 and #7, physical therapy assessment is performed in the month of the first physical therapy, and needle electromyography and nerve conduction are both performed in the same month.  The main difference is that NS patients do not have a Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery.  In patterns #1 and #2, surgery and anesthesia are performed in the fifth  or sixth month, followed by physical therapy sessions.  The last pattern shows that patients usually have their surgery in months fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth 4  Temporal Patterns for HCS Patients Table 12 reveals the temporal patterns for HCS patients.  These patterns can be divided in 2 parts: one is related to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery and the other is related to physical therapy and physical therapy assessment.  As for surgery anesthesia usually comes with it and patients usually have their surgery between the third month and one year.  In the month following a surgery, patients have physical therapy assessment and start to have physical therapy in the following 4 months.  Just like for the two other patient groups, physical therapy assessment is performed in the month of the first physical therapy and is usually performed within one year

NS patients tend to have diagnostic exams or tests in the very beginning.  Surgery patients tend to have physical therapy for longer periods of time in order to relieve pain.  When physical therapy does not help, patients turn to Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery to fix the problem since it is the last resort.  After surgery, they have sessions of physical therapy.  It is also clear that patients in the HCS group tend to have after-surgery physical therapy longer than LCS patients do.  In practice, just injured patients could be automatically authorized a low-cost treatment package which may contain diagnostic exams to evaluate their conditions, such as physical therapy assessment, nerve conduction, and needle electromyography, and sessions of physical therapy up to six months.  If the evaluation of the exam reveals the seriousness of the condition and at least three month sessions of physical therapy do not help, the patients could be automatically authorized for a surgery package which includes Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery anesthesia, one physical therapy assessment, and up to fivemonth sessions of after-surgery physical therapy  D  Comparison between Association Rules and Association Rules Related to Time Association rules show the correlation among treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome patients, such as physical therapy and physical therapy assessment, or physical therapy and surgery.  However, if we add time stamps to the treatment entries, and then apply the Apriori algorithm, we may find association rules related to time Since the pattern is time-annotated, it is possible for us to discover both the duration of a certain treatment and the sequence of treatments for patients and, thus, understand the evolution of this syndrome and estimate the time and possible expenses involved.  For example, when running association rules, we found that physical therapy and physical therapy assessment occur together.  After adding time notation to each treatment, we found physical therapy assessment is performed at the same time as the first session of physical therapy and there is only one time of physical therapy assessment and multiple sessions of physical therapy V  S IGNIFICANCE TO THE I NSURANCE I NDUSTRY  These extracted association rules related to time help us understand the evolution of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Therefore they are helpful in treatment authorization prediction, and fraud detection.  Association rules without time-annotation tell us which treatments happen together When a patient has just gotten injured, he/she could be automatically authorized a package containing diagnostic exams, such as a hand/wrist x-ray and physical therapy assessment, and a couple sessions of physical therapy according to Table 4 and Table 5.  If the results from the diagnostic exams reveal the patientês condition to be serious or the patientês condition does not respond to sessions of physical therapy, the patient could be automatically authorized a Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery package, which includes anesthesia, surgery, and sessions of physical therapy, based on Table 7 and Table 9 With time-stamps, the analysis can include the timing and consequently be more precise.  Diagnostic exams can be authorized in the first few months, and patients may have Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery from the third month to a year or so, followed by up to three months of physical therapy, according to Table 12.  The insurance authorization system can authorize Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery to patients only when the surgery request is made after or in

the third month, and the surgery package can indicate anesthesia and surgery at the same time, and also a 3-month session of physical therapy after the surgery.  This way insurance companies can accurately estimate treatment costs, and employers can accurately estimate the related human resource cost.  Needless to say, insurance companies can also detect irregularities and save money.  As a result the insurance cost and, consequently, the premium may decrease VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Data sets in workersê compensation databases are composed of medical claim data, which can be used to provide correlation between diseases and treatments and correlation between treatments. We developed a method to partition and analyze data to identify these correlations From patientsê claim data sets, we applied association-rule mining to obtain most frequent treatments and to reveal the relationships and sequences of treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and we showed that consistency is a reality in this data set A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank Dr. Paulo Franca from DataCare Corporation for the support and insightful discussions      R EFERENCES  1  R.

frequent, and there is no equal-support pruning in its subsets. So the Bitwise And Operation on binary strings of 0001100011 and 0001100011 is employed. As the result is 0001100011, the support of the itemset {G C, E} is 4, which is equal to {G, C}. E is put into the equal-support set of {G, C}, and does not need to add a new son node. When itemset {C, A, E} is checked, all of its subsets are frequent, and none of them is in the equal-support set. The corresponding two bit strings 0001101111 and 0011101011, are operated by &. The resultant string is 0001101011. The number of 1 in string 0001101011 is 5. So the support of itemset {C, A E} is 5, which is not equal to the support of {C, A}. So a new son node is added to {C, A}. The Trie after generation\(3  5 8 8 G C A E A 4 C 4 E 6 A 6 E 6 E 7 5 E 0001101011 E  Fig. 2.

The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
