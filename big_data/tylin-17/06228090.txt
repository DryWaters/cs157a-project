Discovering Threshold-based Frequent Closed Itemsets over Probabilistic Data Yongxin Tong 1 Lei Chen 2 Bolin Ding 3   Department of Computer Science and Engineering Hong Kong Univeristy of Science and Engineering 1 2 yxtong, leichen}@cse.ust.hk  Department of Computer Science, Un iversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 3 bding3@uiuc.edu  Abstract  In recent years, many new applications, such as sensor network monitoring and moving object search, show a growing amount of importance of uncertain data management and mining. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering threshold-based frequent closed itemsets over probabilistic data Frequent itemset mining over probabilistic database has attracted much attention recently. However, existing solutions may lead an exponential number of results due to the downward closure property over probabilistic data. Moreover, it is hard to directly extend the successful experiences from mining exact data to a probabilistic environment due to the inherent uncertainty of data. Thus, in order to obtain a reasonable result set with small 
size, we study discovering f requent closed itemsets over probabilistic data. We prove that even a sub-problem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset is #P-Hard. Therefore, we develop an efficient mining algorithm based on depth-first search strategy to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. To reduce the search space and avoid redundant computation, we further design several probabilistic pruning and bounding techniques. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments I  I NTRODUCTION  Recently, due to the wide application of uncertain data such as sensor network monitoring [16, 17 o v i n g ob ject  search [8 j e ct identif icat ion 5], etc., m i n i ng f r eq u e nt  itemsets over uncertain \(or pr obabilistic\ data has attracted much attention from the data mining and database communities. However, like its counterpart, mining frequent itemsets over exact data, mining frequent itemsets over uncertain data [4, 9, 22 can  produce an exponential number 
of frequent itemsets which cause the mining results less useful A classical solution is proposed to address the similar problem in exact data, called mining freq uent closed itemset Th e  approach intends to find frequent itemsets whose supports are different from the supports of all their supersets; thus redundant itemsets will be excluded. Since mining frequent closed itemsets offers high-level compression, in this paper we would like to investigate this compression strategy on uncertain data in order to reduce the huge number of frequent itemsets generated by the previous mining methods Unfortunately, the solution for mining frequent closed itemsets over exact data cannot be directly applied to uncertain data as shown by following example TABLE  I A N U NCERTAIN T RANSACTION D ATABASE  TID Location Weather Time

According to logs of ve hicles monitoring, some hidden traffic patterns, such as  the gate of HKUST crossroad always had traffic jam at 2-3 p.m  can be found and be utilized to predict potential traffic problems in the future. However, due to the limitation of sensors, d ata collected by these sensors are often uncertain. Table I shows synthesized transaction data that records traffic situation of one crossroad. For its 
commonality in data processing, we also adopt the tupleuncertainty data model as in this pape m e l y  in T a ble  I, every line represents one tuple which records a sensor reading and its existence probability, where TID is used to identify distinct tuples. For the ease of presentation, we use Table II, which represents each distinct attribute value with a distinct symbol In uncertain database, in orde r to explain the existence of data Possible World Semantics are usually adopted [1, 4, 9 10, 15, 22, 23 icall y  an un certain tran saction datab ase  can be viewed as a set of ex act transaction databases. Every possible world containing zero or more tuples represents one exact transaction database. Tab le III shows all possible worlds originated from Table II and their corresponding probabilities in the first three columns\ For instance, PW5 \(the fifth possible world\ Table III illu strates the appearance of T1 T2, T3 and the absence of T4 and the probability of PW5 equals 0.9×0.6×0.7×\(1-0.9\.0378 According to the definition of probabilistic frequent items m s et i s a probabilistic frequent itemset if and only if the sum of probabilities of possible worlds

The second one is that the itemset must be closed namely, its support must be larger than supports of any of its supersets. Given an uncertain database, we can check the degree that an itemset is a frequent closed itemset by measuring the frequent closed probability which equals the sum of probabilities of possible worlds where such itemset is a frequent closed itemset. Then an itemset is defined as a probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemset  which will be called as probabilistic frequent closed itemset in this paper for simplicity\ and only if its frequent closed probability is larger than the given probabilistic  frequent closed threshold  pfct further explain the concept usi ng the following example Example 1.2  Probabilistic Frequent Closed Itemset  can get all frequent closed itemsets in each possible world in the last column of Table III \(In Table III, {} means an empty set\stance, assume min_ sup=2 and pfct = 0.8, we can compute the frequent closed probability of {abc}=Pr\(PW2 Pr\(PW3\+Pr\(PW5\+Pr\(PW6\Pr\(PW7\+Pr\(PW8\Pr\(PW10 Pr\(PW11\Pr\(PW12\Pr\(PW14\ 0.8754, and that of {abcd is equal to 0.81. Moreover, frequent closed probabilities of 13 other probabilistic frequent itemsets are 0  Among 15 probabilistic frequent itemsets, {abc} and {abcd} are only probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. So, {abc} and {abcd can approximately express whole information of all 15 probabilistic frequent itemsets. Thus, probabilistic frequent closed itemsets can compress the size of all probabilistic frequent itemsets reasonably 001v  With newly defined probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data, we targ et on how to discover these itemsets efficiently over uncertain data. A naïve method first enumerates all possible worlds of a given uncertain database and mines all frequent closed itemsets in each possible world Then frequent closed probability of each itemset can be computed according to the probabilities of possible worlds Finally, those itemsets whose frequent closed probabilities are larger than the given threshold \(pfct\ill be returned as the results. Clearly the naïve solution is very costly due to the exponential number of possible wo rlds. In fact, the operation of computing frequent closed probability is a #P-Hard problem. Therefore, we need to find efficient solutions to compute the probability To summarize, in this paper, we make the following contributions 1. We propose a new problem, mining probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data and prove that even a sub-problem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard 2. We design an efficient algorithm based on depth-first search to discover all probabilis tic frequent closed itemsets. In addition, we propose several probabilistic pruning and bounding techniques to reduce search space and avoid redundant computation 3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm The rest of the paper is organ ized as follows. In Section II we review the mining frequent patterns in exact data and the mining probabilistic frequent patterns over uncertain data. Our problem definition and complexity analysis of the studied problem is introduced in Section III. In Section IV, we propose our efficient algorithm based on depth-first search strategy and several probabilistic pruning techniques Experimental studies are reported in Section V. Finally, we conclude in Section VI II  R ELATED W ORK  In this section, we will review the related work from two categories, frequent pattern mining in exact and uncertain data A  Frequent Pattern Mining over Exact Data Since Rakesh Agrawal proposed the concept of association rule and the Apriori algorithm respectively m a n y  efficient algorithms about mining frequent itemsets have been proposed, such as FP-growth    However, mining the complete set of frequent itemsets produces a lot of redundant itemsets because of the wellknown downward closure property.

algorithms, such as CLOSET  FP clo se 1 2 Charm and th e in spiration of  m i n i ng f r eq u e n t  closed itemset is also extended to other complex structural data, for example mining frequent closed sequential patterns 11, 25 mi n i ng f r eq u e n t clo sed su b g rap h s [26], etc Although there are a lot of works on mining frequent closed patterns, all these algorithms are designed for exact data and cannot be extended to uncertain data directly B  Frequent Pattern Mining over Uncertain Data Another set of researches related with our work are mining frequent patterns over uncertain data. With the advanced research on management of uncertain data, a few novel works of mining frequent patterns over uncertain data have emerged in recent years. According to different interpretations of the uncertainty, existing work for mining frequent pattern over uncertain data are grouped into two categories: approaches based on expected support model and approaches based on probabilistic frequent model. In the expected support model the first work proposed by Chui  u mm ed u p all th e  probabilities of an itemset in all transactions which contain such itemset in order to estimate the support of such itemset Based on the concept of expected support, Chui et al proposed the U-Apriori algorithm o r m i n i ng all f r eq uent  itemset in uncertain data and an efficient decremental pruning strategy ater w i t h th e s a m e ex pected s u pport m o d el UF-growth algorithm adopted the strategy of FP-growth to mining frequent itemset h ree n o v el alg orithm s 1 UApriori, UH-mine and UFP-tree, respectively, extended from three classical algorithms, Ap  H m i n e 20] a n d  FP-growth e re des i gned to f i n d f r equ e n t ite m s ets  A sampling-based algorithm [7 a s al s o propos ed  to approximately mine frequent itemsets based on the expected support. In addition, the problem of mining frequent subgraph patterns in uncertain graphs was also studied   In addition, under the probabilistic frequent model, the dynamic programming strategy was adopted to obtain frequent probabilities of itemsets h en, t w o e f fici ent  algorithms, the bottom-up and the top-down, were designed to find all probabilistic frequent itemsets in tuple-uncertainty m el y  In  ad dition, an efficient algorithm based on the Poisson binomial distribution was proposed to accelerate mining probabilistic frequent itemsets recently Furtherm pr opos ed  an ex act an d a s a m p ling based  algorithm to discover likely frequent items in probabilistic data stream. Moreover, mining probabilistic frequent subgraph patterns in uncertain graphs has also been studied   Although the above researches can obtain probabilistic frequent itemsets efficiently, none of them studied mining probabilistic frequent closed items ets. A natural idea is to discover all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets by simply checking the result set generated from algorithms of Unfortunately, such solution is inefficient because the checking \(namely, computing the frequent closed probability of each itemset\ #P-Hard Thus, in order to tackle this challenge, our work mainly focuses on designing several efficient pruning techniques together with a new search strategy to get probabilistic frequent closed itemsets TABLE  IV T HE U PDATED T ABLE II TID Transaction Prob T1 a  b  c  d 0.9 T2 a  b  c 0.6 T3 a  b  c 0.7 T4 a  b  c  d 0.9 T5 a  b 0.4 T6 a 0.4  In particular, a close related research with our work, mining probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in uncertain database  a s been propos ed rece n t ly  T h is  w o rk de f i n e s a n e w  concept, called the probabilis tic support. When a probabilistic frequent threshold is given, the probabilistic support of each itemset equals the maximum support which can satisfy the probabilistic frequent threshold. Thus, in an ite m s et X is a probabilistic frequent closed itemset if and only if the probabilistic support of such itemset is larger than the min_sup and probabilistic supports of all supersets of this itemset are smaller than the probabilistic support of this itemset. The biggest difference between r w o rk l ies  in problem definitions: our approach can exactly measure the degree that an itemset is frequent closed itemset in all possible worlds. Howe n a b l e to gu ara n tee th a t a probabilistic frequent itemset is always a frequent closed itemset in possible worlds wh ich are used to obtain the probabilistic support of such itemset. We will further explain our difference by the following example. To better illustrate we first add two transactions into Table 2 and build a new uncertain database shown in Table IV. Based on Table IV, We can obtain a contradiction under the definition of Assume min_sup=2 and pft=0.9 which is same as Example 1.2   ill ret u rn a} and abcd  as th e resu lt. W h e n  min_sup=2 and pft=0.8, {ab} an d {abcd} show up as result The frequent probabilities of a} and {ab} are 0.99 which already satisfy both the given thresholds, thus, the frequent closed itemset should not vary \(from {a} to {ab}\hile the threshold decreases from 0.9 to 0.8. In contrast, with the same min_sup=2, no matter how the probabilistic frequent threshold changes, our approach always returns {abc} and {abcd} as results having frequent closed probabilities as 0.88 and 0.99 respectively. Moreover, {a} and {ab}, whose frequent closed probabilities are only 0.4, won  t be returned as final results. In short, our result includes more useful information and guarantees the strict probabilistic semantics III  P ROBLEM D EFINITION  A  Frequent Closed Itemset in Exact Data Let I = {i 1 i 2 i n be a set of distinct items. We call a non-empty subset of I, X, as an itemset or pattern. For brevity we use X= x 1 x 2  x n to denote itemset X={x 1 x 2  x n X is called the l itemset if it has l items. Given a \(exact\saction database, TDB, each transaction is denoted as a tuple <tid, X where tid is a transaction identifier. The number of transactions in TDB containing X is called the support of X denoted as support\(X

In following Theorems, we first prove the problem of computing the closed probability of an itemset in UTD is #P-Hard. Thus the problem of computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset in UTD is also #P-Hard Theorem 3.1 It is #P-hard to compute the closed probability of an itemset in an uncertain transaction database Proof In order to prove the problem of computing the closed probability of an itemset is #P-hard, we reduce it from the monotone DNF counting problem \(#MDNF\, which is known to be #P-com  Consider an instance of #MDNF: Given a monotone DNF formula 12  n FC C C 000 \000 000 with n clauses and m Boolean variables 12     m vv v In each clause 12  il Cyy y 000 \000 000 we have y j  12      m vv v 000 and each variable can appear at most once. The #MDNF problem is to count the number of satisfying assignments of variables for the formula F  We map the above instance of #MDNF to an uncertain transaction database UTD  T 1 T 2 T m where each itemset T j corresponds to a variable v j Create itemset X and another n items e 1 e 2 e n where e i  corresponds to a clause C i For every itemset, we have X  000 T j and for each T j and each e i we have e i 000 T j if and only if v j does NOT appear in the clause C i In this database, each itemset appears with probability ½.

Theorem 3.2 It is #P-hard to compute the frequent closed probability of an itemset when the min_sup is given in an uncertain transaction database Proof The problem of computing the closed probability of an itemset is a special case of the problem of computing frequent closed probability of such itemset when min_sup=1 Based on Theorem 3.1 we know the problem of computing the closed probability of an itemset is #P-Hard, so the problem of computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset is also #P-Hard 001v  IV  T HE D EPTH F IRST M INING A LGORITHM  Based on the definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets, a naïve solution need s to enumerate all possible worlds and itemsets firstly, and then check the probability of each itemset. However, there are an exponential number of possible worlds and itemsets, so the naïve solution is not scalable when the database size becomes large. Thus, in this paper, we design a Bounding-Pruning-Checking framework to avoid redundant computation Fig. 1 illustrates major steps of the general framework including constructing single item candidate set, bounding pruning, and checking phases. In remaining parts of this Section, we give the details about each step. We introduce the Chernoff-Hoeffding Bound-based Pruning in Section A. Three pruning methods Superset  Pruning, Subset  Pruning and Frequent Closed Probability Bound-based Pruning are discussed in Section B. In the end, we present a depth-first search-based mining algorithm  ______________________________________________________________  Fig. 1  Framework of MPFCI A  Bounding Frequent Probability As shown in the framework, in the first phase, we will compute a candidate set of probabilistic frequent single items According to definitions of frequent probability, closed probability and frequent closed probability Definition 3.4, 3.6 3.7 we know that the frequent closed probability of an itemset is not larger than either the frequent probability or the closed probability. Thus, both the frequent probability and closed probability of an itemset are upper bounds of the frequent closed probability of this itemset. In addition, we have also proven that computing closed probability is a #PHard problem and we know that there exists the polynomial time algorithm to compute the frequent probability. Thus, it is a natural idea to bound the frequent closed probability by the frequent probability. However, it is meaningless to compute the exact frequent probability if it is very small. Thus, instead of directly computing the frequent probabilities using the existing method, we propose a pruning technique based on the  Chernoff-Hoeffding bound 35 to f ilter ou t proba bilis tic  infrequent items. This pruning is further explained by the following lemma Lemma 4.1  Chernoff-Hoeffding Bound-based Pruning   Given an itemset X, an uncertain transaction database UTD  X  s expected support 000P a minimum support threshold min_sup probabilistic frequent closed threshold pfct an itemset X is a probabilistic infrequent itemset if 22 2 2 2 0 n n epfct epfct 000\020 000\020 000 000\037\000 000 000\037\000\037\000\037 000 000G 000G 000G\000P 000G\000P  where min_ sup 1  n 000 \000\020\000\020 000G\000P and n is the number of transactions in UTD Proof According the definition of the frequent probability Pr{support\(X 000t  min_sup equals Pr{support\(X 000 min_sup 1}. Moreover, based on the Chernoff-Hoeffing bound [3  w e  can get the following inequality 22 2 2 2 Pr sup    0 n n epfct Xn epfct 000\020 000\020 000 000\037\000 000\020\000 000\037 000 000\037\000\037\000\037 000 000G 000G 000G\000P 000P\000G 000G\000P  001v  B  Computing Frequent Closed Probability 1. Basic idea  Again, based on definitions of frequent probability, closed probability and frequent closed probability \(Definiton 3.4, 3.6 3.7\ we can find that the frequent closed probability of a given itemset, X, equals to the frequent probability of X subtracted by the frequent non-closed probability of X Formally, we define the frequent non-closed probability of an itemset as follows Definition 4.1  Frequent Non-Closed Probability en an itemset X, an uncertain transaction database UTD a minimum support threshold min_sup the frequent non-closed probability of X is the probabilit y that there exists at least one superset of X which always appears together with X at least min_sup times Assume that there are m other items 12   m ee e besides items of X in UTD, the frequent non-closed probability of X is 1 Pr   m CC 000\000 where i C denotes an event that the superset of X, X i e always appear together with X at least min_sup  times According to Definition 4.1, we know that computing the frequent non-closed probability is equivalent to computing the probability of the corresponding DNF formula. Hence, we can use the Inclusive-Exclusive Principle to compute the frequent non-closed probability as follows. Let 1  m FC C 000 \000\000  1 1 1 1 1 1  Pr  Pr  Pr    1 Pr   m m m iij ii im i jm i i m FC CC CC 000\020 000d\000d 000d\000\037 000d 000d 000\037 000\037 000d 000 \000\020 000\000\016\000\016\000\020 000\000 000¦\000 000 where Pr i C means the probability that the superset of X X i e always appear together with X at least min_sup times

274 


Based on the above formula, it is important to know how to compute Pr i C which is consists of two independent parts of probabilities: 1\e first pa rt is the probability that the superset of X, X i e always appear together with X, and 2 the second part is the probability that both X and X i e appear at least min_sup times simultaneously. \(Thus, this part probability is just equal to the frequent probability of X i e since X i e contains X\Thus, Pr i C be computed as follows Pr  1 Pr  Pr   j ijFi TT CTXe 000 000 \000\020 000u 000\016 000  where T represents a set of transactions which contain itemset X but do not contain itemset X i e and the frequent probability of X i e can be computed by the dynamic programming approach   To speed up the computation of the frequent closed probability, we introduce several pruning and bounding techniques to reduce the computation cost in next several subsections 2. Pruning Techniques  Although we use the Inclusive-Exclusive Principle to compute the frequent closed probability of an itemset, the cost of computation is still high. Fortunately, we find two efficient pruning rules based on properties of the frequent closed probability. To explain these pruning rules clearly, we first define the count of an itemset Definition 4.2  Count of An Itemset en an itemset X and an uncertain transaction database UTD the count of X is the numbers of transactions which contain X For example, to the same un certain transaction database UTD in Table II, given itemsets a,b,c,d}, {a,b,c,d}.count=2 because only T1 and T4 possibly contain {a,b,c,d Lemma 4.2  Superset Pruning en an itemset X whose size is |X|, an uncertain database UTD and X  s superset X i e  whose size is |X|+1, if i e is smaller than at least one item in X with respect to the alphabetic order \(namely, X is not the prefix of X i e by means of the alphabetic order\, and X.count= X i e count, we can get the following two results 1  s frequent closed probability is zero and X must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemset 2\ll supersets with X as prefix based on the alphabetic order must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemsets Proof According to the given cond itions, there is a superset of X, X i e and X.count= X i e count, X and X i e always appear together in all possible worlds. Thus, Pr FC X addition, for each superset of X, there must be at least one superset of X i e which always appears with such superset of X together in all possible worlds. Thus, frequent closed probabilities of all supersets must also be 0. Furthermore, all supersets of X are not probabilistic frequent closed itemsets So, the lemma holds  001v  We use the following example to further explain lemma 4.2 Example 4.1  Superset Pruning In our running example shown in Table II, we know that    bc abc 000 Item a is smaller than b and c according to the alphabetic order, {a,b,c is not a superset with {b,c} as prefix and {b,c}.count a,b,c}.count, so {b,c} and supersets with {b,c} as prefix must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemsets Moreover, besides the superset pruning, we propose another pruning technique, subset pruning, to further reduce search space Lemma 4.3  Subset Pruning Given an uncertain transaction database UTD an itemset X, and X  s subset Xi e  i e is the last item in X according to the alphabetic order. If X.count Xi e count, we can get the following two results 1 i e  s frequent closed probability is zero and Xi e must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemset 2\sets which have the same prefix Xi e and the same size, |X|, must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemsets supersets of such itemsets must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemsets Proof We know X.count= Xi e count, Xi e always appears together with X in all possible worlds. Thus, Pr FC Xi e  and Xi e is not probabilistic frequent closed itemset Moreover, for each itemset which has the prefix Xi e and the same size, |X|, there must be at least one superset of X, which always appears with this itemset with the prefix Xi e together in all possible worlds. Thus, frequent closed probabilities of itemsets which have the same prefix Xi e and the same size X| are zero. So, these itemsets and their supersets are not probabilistic frequent closed itemsets 001v  We also use an example to further explain the lemma 4. 3 Example 4.2  Subset Pruning our running example shown in Table II, {a,b,c} and {a b,d} have the same prefix of a,b} and the same size In addition, {a,b}.count a,b,c}.count, so {a,b} must not be probabilistic frequent closed itemset. In addition, {a,b d} and their all supersets are also not probabilistic frequent closed itemsets 3. Bounding Frequent Closed Probability To avoid meaningless computation of the frequent closed probability, we adopt the upper bound and the lower bound of frequent closed probability to filter out the unqualified itemsets Lemma 4.4  Upper Bound and Lower Bound of Frequent Closed Probability en an itemset X, an uncertain transaction database UTD and min_sup if there are m other items besides items in X 12   m ee e the frequent closed probability of X, Pr FC X\ies 2 1 1 121 Pr  Pr   Pr   Pr  Pr  Pr\(\Pr\(\min Pr\(\2 Pr 1 m i FC F iij i ji mmi FC F i i j iij C XX CCC XX C CCm 000 000z 000\020 000 \000 \000 000 000d\000\020 000 000\016\000 000 000 000 000t\000\020 000\020 000 000 000 000 000 000¦\000¦\000  where i C represents the event that the superset of X, X i e  always appear together with X at least min_sup times

Proof We know that the frequent closed probability equals the corresponding frequent probability subtracting the frequent non-closed probability. Moreover the frequent nonclosed probability can be expressed as Inclusive-Exclusive Principle form, namely, the frequent non-closed probability of X is denoted as 1 Pr   m CC 000\000 According to the de Caen probability inequality and t h e K w erel probab ilit y  inequality e  can g et t h e  f o llo w i ng f o r m ulas  2 1 1 1 1 121 Pr  Pr   Pr  Pr  Pr   min Pr  2 Pr    1 m i m iij i ji mmi miij iij C CC CCC CC C CCm 000 000z 000\020 000 \000 \000 000 000\000 000t 000 000\016\000 000 000 000 000\000 000d 000\020 000 000 000 000 000 000¦\000¦\000  Thus, the frequent closed probability of X, Pr FC X satisfies the following result 2 1 1 121 Pr  Pr   Pr   Pr  Pr  Pr   Pr   min Pr  2 Pr    1 m i FC F iij i ji mmi FC F i i j iij C XX CCC XX C CCm 000 000z 000\020 000 \000 \000 000 000d\000\020 000 000\016\000 000 000 000 000t\000\020 000\020 000 000 000 000 000 000¦\000¦\000  So, the lemma holds 001v  According to Lemma 4.4, we can further prune an itemset without computing its frequent closed probability if the upper bound of the frequent closed probability of the itemset is smaller than the given probabilistic frequent closed threshold 4. An Approximate Algorithm of Computing Frequent Closed Probability For each remaining itemset after all pruning methods, we have to compute its frequent closed probability. Because the computation of the frequent closed probability of an itemset is P-Hard, we give a Monte-Carlo approximation algorithm to compute an approximate frequent closed probability of an itemset with a bounded error. The main idea of Monte-Carlo algorithm is to approximate a real value through a number of samplings, thus, it is most important for the approximation algorithm to select a suitable sampling method A naïve sampling method randomly samples a possible world of a given uncertain transaction database and discovers all frequent closed itemsets in this possible world. The process repeats N times. For each itemset, we use the ratio between the number of sampled possible worlds that the itemset is a frequent closed itemset and N as the approximate frequent closed probability of this itemset. Clearly, with the increasing of the number of samplings, the approximate frequent closed probability of each itemset gets closer to its real frequent closed probability. However, the shortcoming of the naïve sampling method is that we cannot know the exact number of samplings that we need to run before all samplings end To address this problem, we propose a Monte-Carlo approximation algorithm which satisfies FPRAS \(fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme\mely given a relative tolerance error 0010 and a probabilistic confidence degree 001 the approximate frequent closed probability of an itemset X Pr   FC X 000 must satisfies Pr Pr   Pr     1 FC FC XX 000 000\020\000\037\000t\000\020 000H\000G Because we have already changed the problem of computing frequent non-closed probability of an itemset to the problem of computing the probability of the corresponding DNF formula, based on the coverage algorithm for DNF Counting problem e c a n propose the following sampling solution Our sampling method Given a minimum support min_sup an uncertain database UTD which has n  transactions and m distinct items, and an itemset X which contains k items, the DNF formula will consisted of m-k events. We firstly accumulate each  i Pr C to a real number Z as an upper bound of the frequent non-closed probability of X Then, we repeat N samplings and define two variables of real number, U and V, which are initialized as zero. In each sampling, we sample an event i C at first, and then continue to sample a possible world that must satisfy the event i C and accumulate the probability of such possible world to V. Thus V records the total probabilities of N samplings. Meanwhile we still check whether the sampled possible world can satisfy two following conditions: 1\he possible world only satisfies the event i C 2\e possible world cannot satisfy i-1 other events from 1 C to 1 i C 000\020 If the sampled possible world satisfies above two requirements, we also accumulate the probability of the sampled possible world to U, which measures the contribution of each event i C to the probability of the DNF formula. Finally, when N samplings end, we use UZ/V as the estimate of the approximate frequent non-closed probability Pr   FNC X 000 The detailed steps of our algorithm to compute the frequent closed probability is listed in Fig. 2 __________________________________________________ Fig. 2 Approximate Computing Frequent Closed Probability

Time Complexity Analysis According to the description of Procedure ApproxFCP, given the itemset X an uncertain transaction database UTD the number of all distinct items is m, then let k  m  X we can derive the time complexity of Procedure ApproxFCP is 2 2 4ln\(2   kUTD O 000G 000H Please note  UTD represents the number of transactions in UTD Thus, the approximate algorithm needs a smaller number of samples than the naïve algorithm\ while guaranteeing that the estimated probability is precise enough  C  The Depth-First Mining Algorithm According to the framework in Fig. 1, after we get a candidate set of probabilistic frequent items based on Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning, we extend each possible itemset based on the depth-first search strategy. The Procedure, ProbFC, in Fig. 3 gives the details about the depthfirst search-based mining algorithm, which seamlessly integrates the above discussed solutions. In addition, if the current itemset fails to be pruned, we will compute X  s frequent closed probability to decide whether X is a probabilistic frequent closed itemset In ProbFC algorithm, we firstly decide whether current itemset, X, needs to grow by the Superset Pruning in lines 1-2 If the pruning holds, all supersets with X as prefix based on the alphabetic order need not be generated \(based on Lemma 4.2 If the Superset Pruning fails to hold, we continue to generate the superset of X, X j e where j e is larger than the last item in X with respect to the alphabetic order. \(Please note all items in X are ordered by the alphabetic order from small to large\Then, in lines 5-6, we decide whether X j e is a probabilistic frequent itemset based on the ChernoffHoeffding bound-based Pruning. If X j e is not probabilistic frequent, all supersets of X j e need not be produced as well If X j e fails to be filtered out in line 5, we continue to execute the Subset Pruning to X j e If Subset Pruning holds, we can get the following two results: 1\ must not be a probabilistic frequent closed itemset, 2\her supersets of X which have the same prefix X and the same size, |X|+1, need not be enumerated in lines 7-8. Please note that e k is larger than j e  based on Lemma 4.3 X j e cannot be filtered by above pruning strategies, in lines 9-10, we only compute the upper bound and the lower bound of the frequent closed probability of X j e If the upper bound is smaller than user-given threshold or the upper bound equals the lower bound, the frequent closed probability of X j e need not be computed Then, we do not directly compute the frequent closed probability of X j e because X j e still might be pruned by its superset. Hence, we continue to recursively call the function ProbFC, to enumerate supersets of X j e based on depth-first search strategy in line 11. Finally, if X j e fails to be pruned we have to execute the steps in lines 12-14. In line 12, the Monte-Carlo  based approximate algorithm, ApproxFCP, is called to compute an approximate frequent closed probability Then, we check whether X is a probabilistic frequent closed itemset based on its approximate frequent closed probability in lines 13-14 __________________________________________________ Fig. 3 Algorithm of ProbFC We further use an example to show how to find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets using ProbFC Example 4.3  Depth-First Search-based Mining Algorithm  For the uncertain database UTD in Table II with min_sup 2 probabilistic frequent closed threshold pfct 0.8. The process of mining probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in UTD is shown in Fig. 4 1. Find a candidate set of probabilistic frequent items. Based on Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning, we get a candidate set of probabilistic frequent items Cand={a,b,c,d 2. Discover all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets 2.1. {a} passes the test of Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning, and {a}.count={ab}.count, so we need not grow the paths of {ac} and {ad}, based on the Subset Pruning 2.2. Similar to step 2.1, the Subset Pruning avoids growing abd} and their supersets. In the depth-first search of a} as prefix, we can finally obtain two probabilistic frequent closed itemset {abc} and {abcd}. Their frequent closed probabilities can be computed by our approximate algorithm marked by grey in Fig. 4 2.3. After finishing all enumeration with prefix {a}, we continue to test itemsets with other prefix. According to Superset Pruning, we can stop growing any itemsets. Namely, the whole enumeration process ends

Based on the above recursive function call, we get the result set: {abc, fcp: 0.875}, {abcd, fcp: 0.81}, where itemset, fcp:value} denotes the itemset and the value of this frequent closed probability, respectively    Fig. 4 Algorithm of ProbFC TABLE  VII I NDIVIDUAL FEATURES OF ALGORITHMS IN OUR EXPERIMENTS  Algorithm  CH Super Sub PB Framework MPFCI 003 000\003 003  003  003  000\007\000\011\000\026\000\003 MPFCI-NoCH  003  003  003  000\007\000\011\000\026\000\003 MPFCI-NoBound 003  003  003   000\007\000\011\000\026  MPFCI-NoSuper 003   003  003  000\007\000\011\000\026\000\003 MPFCI-NoSub 003  003   003  000\007\000\011\000\026\000\003 MPFCI-BFS 003 000\003 000\003  003 000\003 000\005\000\011\000\026\000\003  TABLE  VIII C HARACTERISTICS OF D ATASETS  Dataset Number of Transaction Number of Items Average Length Maximal Length Mushroom 8124 120 23 23 T20I10D30KP40 30000 40 20 40  V  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this section, we report our experimental study on the performances of MPFCI and effectiveness of pruning strategies. We compare MPFCI with other four algorithms MPFCI without Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning, \(MPFCINoCH\, MPFCI without superset pruning \(MPFCI-NoSuper MPFCI without subset pruning \(MPFCI-NoSub\d MPFCI without probabilistic bound of the closed probability pruning MPFCI-NoBound\reover, we verify the efficiencies of different search strategies, dept h-first search and breadth-first search. We implemented a breadth-first search-based algorithm, MPFCI-BFS, which utilizes the ChernoffHoeffding bound-based pruning and the frequent closed probability bound-based pruning. However, MPFCI-BFS cannot use superset pruning and subset pruning because they won  t show up in BFS  s enumeration, which nullifies checking on ensuing pruning conditions. Finally, we also report the compression quality of mining probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. More details of six algorithms are listed in Table VII. Table VII has five columns where CH means the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning, Super means the superset pruning, Sub means the subset pruning, PB means the frequent closed probability-based pruning, and Framework means the algorithm framework used by different algorithms TM\ i5 2.40GHz Dell laptops with 4GB main memory, running on Microsoft Windows 7. All the programs are implemented in Visual C++ 2010 Since real uncertain data sets are not available, in our experiments, we follow the experimental method adopted by the previous work  generate probabilistic datasets from a real certain dataset and a synthetic certain dataset by assigning a probability generated from Gaussian distribution to each transaction. The real certain dataset is Mushroom which contains characteristics of various species of mushrooms. The synthetic dataset, T20I10D30KP40 is generated from IBM dataset gene rator  w it h an aver age  transaction length 20 and an average itemset length 10 [2   The synthetic dataset contains 30000 transactions and 40 unique items T h e characte ri stics of above two datasets are shown in Table VIII. In addition, to verity the influence of uncertainty, we test two scenarios The first scenario is that a dataset follows Gaussian distribution with low mean and high variance, namely probabilities of transactions are similar and close to each other. We make the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25. Another scenario is that a dataset follows Gaussian distribution with high mean and low variance. In our experiment, we make T20I10D30KP40 follow Gaussian distribution with mean 0.8 and variance 0.1 A  Efficiency and Effectiveness of Pruning Strategies In this subsection, we report the efficiency of algorithms and effectiveness of pruning strategies. There are 4 parameters in our mining algorithm, MPFCI, which are minimum support min_sup, probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct, relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 001 We test influences of each parameter in terms of total running time and effectiveness of pruning methods. We set default values to each parameter as follows. The min_sup  is set to 0.4 in Mushroom da taset and 0.3 in T20I10D30KP40 dataset \(which is the median of our experiment about min_sup We set pfct to 0.8 since results with low probability are usually meaningless 0010 and 001 the probabilistic confidence degree is 1\001 set to 0.1 because large error also leads to meaningless results. When a parameter changes, other three parameters are fixed to their default values. In addition, we did not report the running times over 1 hour if other algorithms can finish the same task within 1 hour Firstly, we test the efficiency of our algorithm w.r.t. the running time compared with a naive method. Fig 5 \(a\shows comparison of running time be tween Naive and our algorithm MPFCI, while min_sup increase from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. Here, the naive method called Naive, directly use our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability one by one after obtaining all probabilistic frequent itemsets based on TODIS algorithm W e  can observe that the running time of the Naive algorithm exceed 1 
278

hour after the min_sup becomes smaller than 0.4. However the MPFCI algorithm can find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets efficiently. This explains that the computational cost of directly testing frequent closed probability increases sharply with the increase of the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets \(The number increases w.r.t the increase of min_sup\milar results can be found in Fig. 5\(b\which also reports comparison of running time in T20I10D30KP40 dataset. Hence, it is inefficien t to directly check frequent closed probabilities of all probabilistic frequent itemsets which can be obtain by existing solution, such as TODIS [22  Next, we focus on the test of effectiveness of different pruning strategies Effect of min_sup in MPFCI We firstly investigated the running time of five compared algorithms w.r.t. the minimum support, min_sup. Fig. 6\(a\ shows the running time of all algorithms while min_sup changes from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. When min_sup decreases, we observe that the running time of all the algorithms goes up due to the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets increases. However we find that the growth speed of MPFCI is the lowest due to all pruning methods it employed. We also find that MPFCINoCH has the similar running time with that of MPFCI. This indicates that the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning contributes less to reduce the total running time compared to other pruning methods. In addition, MPFCI-NoBound is the slowest algorithm. In particular the running time of MPFCINoBound is larger than 1 hour when min_sup is smaller 0.3 Similar results can be found in Fig. 6\(b\hich reports the running time of all algorithms in T20I10D30KP40  dataset Effect of pfct in MPFCI We continue to test the running time of five compared algorithms with varying the probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct in two different b\, we can obverse that MPFCI is always the fastest algorithm. With regards to the change of pfct, the running time of all algorithms remains approximately the same. Thus, in tuple-model uncertain transaction database we can discover that the influence of probabilistic frequent closed threshold will be smaller than that of min_sup to the total running time. Meanwhile, MPFCI is the fastest algorithm and MPFCI-NoBound is still the slowest one, which indicates that the probabilistic bound pruning is more effective than other pruning methods  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 5 Efficiency Comparison between MPFCI and Naïve  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 6 Running time w.r.t min_sup    a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 7 Running time w.r.t pfct   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 8 Running time w.r.t 0010   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 9 Running time w.r.t 001  Effect of 000H 000H in MPFCI In this part, we mainly analyse the influence of the relative tolerance error  0010 to the running time in Fig. 8 \(a\\(b\ With the change of 0010 we can observe: 1 four algorithms, MPFCI, MPFCI-NoCH, MPFCI-NoSuper and MPFCI-NoSub, keep a steady running time. 2\e algorithm of MPFCI-NoBound becomes slower clearly when 0010  becomes lower. In addition, the above observations also verify the time complexity analysis of the approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability. Because the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm does not use any probabilistic bound pruning to reduce redundant computation for frequent closed probability, we have to compute closed probabilities of all itemsets which cannot be removed by other pruning methods.  Please note that the time complexity of our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability is 2 4 ln\(2       Ok UTD 000G\000H Moreover, the running time of approximation algorithm will increase 2 1   O 000H with the decreasing of 0010 Thus, the decreasing of 000H causes more influence to the running time of the MPFCI-NoBound

algorithm. Moreover, other four algorithms utilize the probabilistic bounds pruning, so they can avoid redundant computation of frequent closed probabilities Effect of 000G 000G in MPFCI We finally studied the influence of running time from the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 000G in  Fig. 9 \(a\d \(b\We can find the similar effect with the change of 000H Namely, the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm is also affected greatly by the change of 000G By comparing the results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can discover that the influence of 000G on the running time of MPFCINoBound is smaller than the influence of 000H This is because with decreasing of 000G the running time of MPFCI-NoBound about computing frequent closed probability will increase ln\(2   O 000G   B  Compression Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we mainly evaluate the compression quality of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in probabilistic data against that of frequent closed itemsets in exact data. Without loss of gene rality, we test the compression quality under two different di stributions over Mushroom dataset. The first one makes the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. The second one follows Gaussian distribu tion whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25 \(Namely, the default set of the Mushroom dataset in our experiments\n addition, we keep same default values of pfct=0.8 000H 0.1, and 000G 0.1 as used in the last subsection We compare the number of itemsets of frequent itemsets for short FI\, frequent closed itemsets \(for short FCI probabilistic frequent itemsets \(for short PFI\, and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets \(for short PFCI\he first two kinds of itemsets are produced by FP-growth algorithm orithm 24] f r o m th e exa ct Mushroom dataset. The PFI and PFCI are generated by TODIS algorithm r alg orithm respecti v e l y   Fig. 10 \(a\hows the comparison of the number of above four kinds of itemsets under the uncertain Mushroom dataset whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. With min_sup decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1, we observe that the ratio between Number of FCI and Number of FI declines sharply Meanwhile, the ratio between Number of PFCI and Number of PFI also declines quickly. That means the probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data have the similar compression effect with frequent closed itemsets in exact data Fig. 10 \(b\ also shows the similar compression result However, we also observe that the compression effect of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in Fig. 10 \(b\is worse than that in Fig. 10 \(a\hat is because Fig. 10 \(b\he smaller mean than Fig. 10 \(a\as the higher variance than Fig. 10 \(a\ The smaller mean and higher variance indicate higher uncertainty, which leads to less number of probabilistic frequent itemsets and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets under same threshold To sum up, above results demonstrate that our definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps the good compression property of frequent closed itemsets in exact data  a  Mean  0.8,  Var=0.1                     \(b  Mean  0.5,  Var=0.25 Fig. 10 Compression Quality  w.r.t min_sup  C  Approximation Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the approximation quality of our mining algorithm since the problem of computing frequent closed probability has been proven as a #P-Hard problem Because approximation effect of our algorithm is determined by the relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter  001 we mainly focus on testing the change of the result set w.r.t the change of 0010 and 001 over our default uncertain Mushroom dataset. We denote the set of the final result as FR and the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets as TI. We use precision which equals FR TI FR and recall which equals FR TI TI to measure the approximate effect. Moreover, it is hard to get the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets due to #P-hard complexity. Thus, we use the result set when 0010 0.01 and 001 0.01 as true result set Fig. 11 \(a\ows that the change of precision and recall when 0010 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 001 equals 0.1. We observe that the recall keeps s teady, but precision decreases with 0010 increasing. Because the number of sampling in the ApproxFCP algorithm equals 2 42 ln n 000H\000G  the number of sampling will decrease significantly with 0010 increasing. Moreover 001  equals 0.1, probabilistic confidence degree is also fixed. Thus the number of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps steady and recall also remain stable. Similarly, Fig. 11 \(b shows the case where 001 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 0010  equals 0.1. Because 001 only influences the number of sampling on ln 2  000G times, recall is affected slightly and precision also remains stable. To sum up, above results demonstrate that our approximation algorithm has a good approximation quality  a  Varying 0010 b  Varying 001  Fig. 11 Approximation Quality in Mushroom  D  Algorithm Framework Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the efficiencies of the depthfirst search-based and breadth-fi rst search-based strategies Fig. 12\(a\hows the running time of two search solutions while min_sup varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and other parameters are

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
