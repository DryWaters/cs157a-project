 Research proposal grouping is one of the most important tasks for resea rch project selection in research funding agencies. In this paper, a novel ontology based frequent itemset method is proposed to deal with research proposal grouping problem. In the proposed method, a research ontology is firstly constructed to standardize research keywords 
Abstract 
Secondly, frequent itemsets with different support degrees are extracted from research proposals based on research ontology. Thir dly, a new measure of similarity degree between two research proposals is developed and then a clus tering algorithm is proposed to classify research proposals based on the similarity degree, in which some para meters are discussed, and the proper parameters are s elected. Finally, when the number of research proposals in some clusters is still large, research proposals are further d ivided into small groups, in which the number of research proposals is approximately equal. The proposed method is validated based on the selection process at the National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC\. The experimental r esults show that our proposed method can imp rove the efficiency and effectiveness of research proposal grouping, and is a potential and alternative on e to support research project selection processes 
in other governments and private research funding agencies 
 
Project selection is a recurring and significant activity in many organizations \(e.g., research funding agencies and it is also a complicated and multi-stage decision-making process. It begins with a call for proposals \(CFP\, and proposals are then submitted to the body, such as research funding agencies. When these proposals are collected, they are sent to reviewers for peer review. Reviewers normally review proposals according to the instructio ns on the rules and criteria provided by organizations Once the review process is finished, the review results are aggregated and these proposals are ranked. Finally, some outstanding proposals are funded. To support project selection process, several formal methods have been proposed For example, a fuzzy logic approach is applied to proj  A fu zz y  A H P  m e t h od i s

proposals according to the instructions on the rules and criteria provided by NSFC, and return the review results When the review process is finished, the review results are aggregated and some of research proposals with higher ranking are recommended for panel review. Finally, some outstanding proposals are funded During the process, there is a strict evaluation to decide whether to fund a proposal or not So, to support research project selection, some specific methods and systems are proposed For general research project selection pr ocess, an organizational decision support system to assist research project selection [7-8 w h ile a  m u ltil i n g u al o n tology framework is suggested to support research project selection T o s u pport s p ecific phases for research project selection, a hybrid knowledge rule and genetic algorithm is suggested for research proposal grouping 10u rth e r m ore an on tolo gy based te xt  mining method \(OTMM\to cluster proposals is proposed for research project selection g r ou p  decision support method is offered to evaluate experts for research project selectio n [13 and an integrated  decision support model to assess reviewers for research project selection [14 A hy b r id k n o w led g e b ased and  modeling approach is offered to assign reviewers to proposals for research project selection [15  w h ile a  decision support approach is presented for assigning reviewers to grouped proposals, and genetic algorithm is employed to solve the assignment problem [16  A text-mining approach is suggested to identify reviewers and assign reviewers to propos A  m e t h od of optimal allocation of proposals to reviewers is presented in order to facilitate the selection process 18  Fin all y  a n in te g r ated m e t h od f o r co llaborativ e research project selection is proposed according to competitiveness and collaboration of candidates [19  As can be seen from the process, proposal grouping is one of the most critical stages because the quality of proposal grouping can greatly affect the review quality Among the literatures, previous studies mainly focus on general project selection process but not specific phases, such as proposal grouping. Furthermore specific phases to cluster proposals mainly focus on the diversity of applicants characteristics [10-11  w h il e  ignoring the content similarities of research proposals Through text mining has been introduced for research proposal grouping e to th e h i gh co m p u t ing complexity and the difficulty of controlling clustering results, this method may lead to poor performance when the number of research proposals is large  To cover this research gap this paper contributes an ontology based frequent itemset method \(OFIM\ to support research proposal grouping The rest of this paper is organized as follows Literature review is presented in Section 2, and the proposed ontology based frequent itemset method is developed to cluster research proposals for research project selection in Section 3. For illustrating the efficiency of the proposed method empirical analysis of proposal grouping is reported in Section 4. Finally conclusions and future research directions are summarized in Section 5 As mentioned above, research proposal grouping is critically important in the process of research project selection. So, some formal methods have been proposed from different aspects. Firstly, the applicants characteristics are consid ered in research proposal grouping. In each research proposal group, the applicants characteristics should be diversified. A hybrid knowledge rule and genetic algorithm is proposed for research proposal grouping according to applicants characteristics [10 th e p r opos ed  method knowledge rules are designed to identity and classify research proposals, and genetic algorithm is developed to group research proposals. Secondly, topic similarity is also an important issue when dealing with grouping. Research topic should be similar in each research proposal group. So, an ontology based text mining method to cluster proposals is proposed for research project selection In  th is propos ed method, a research ontology is constructed, and research proposals are class ified according to discipline areas using a so rting algorithm, and then research proposals in each discipline are clustered using a self-organized mapping \(SOM When the number of research proposals is large OTMM using traditional term frequency method may lead to poor performance due to the high computing complexity Frequent itemsets, which can make use of relationship among documents can improve the quality of clustering So, f r eq u e nt ite m s et m e t h ods h a v e  been introduced for text clustering problems. Two clustering algorithms including clustering based on frequent word sequences \(CFWS\ clustering based on frequent word meaning sequences \(CFWMS\ is suggested for text clustering w h ile a f u zz y frequent itemsets for hierarchical document clustering is proposed [2 ilarl y   ma x i m u m capt u ring i s  developed for text clus   In this paper, the idea of frequent itemset clustering is employed, and a new clustering algorithm is designed to support research proposal grouping for research project selection

When research proposals are received by the NSFC they are firstly classified into different disciplines in terms of discipline codes. However, when research proposals belonging to one certain specific discipline they will be further divided into different groups, in which the number of research proposals is approximately equal Although many text-mining approaches have been applied in English texts clustering and some even in various text materials, especially the research proposals To attain this requirement, combining the ontology based text mining method \(OTMM  and f r eq u e n t  itemsets [20-23 an on tology based f r eq u e n t ite m s e t  method \(OFIM\ is proposed for research proposal grouping, and the framework of the proposed method is shown in Figure 2 Research Projects Research Proposals Research Proposals in Disciplines OFIM Research Proposal Clusters Research Proposal Groups Research Ontology Figure 2 The framework of the proposed method As can be seen from Figure 2, a research ontology is first built by the keywords collected from the research projects in latest fi ve years, and research proposals are classified into each discipline. When research proposal are classified into disciplines proposal grouping is considered in the following three phases. In the first phase, all concepts and subconcepts in the ontology are encoded and put into a set and research proposals are transformed into figures sequence, and the words outside our set are removed After this processing, in the second phase, the method supported by generalized suffix tree \(GST\data structure proposed in [23 is u s ed to ex tract th e  frequent itemsets with different minimal support and different length from research proposals. In the last phase, different combining patterns of these frequent itemsets is tried as representatives of research proposals, then a new clustering algorithm is proposed to group proposals In short, the proposed OFIM can be divided into three phases, including Phase 1 coding and compacting research proposals Phase 2 getting frequent itemsets and Phase 3 clustering research proposals The following subsections will give details about the above mentioned three phases of the OFIM This subsection can be called the preprocessing of research proposals Through this processing, the proposal texts without apparent delimiters, especially Chinese texts, are segregated into different words with a specific meaning in this domain. And these meaningless words are natura lly filtered out. Besides every meaningful word is represented by a corresponding integer which is called identifier of this word and proposals are transformed into encoded proposals, which are compos ed by sequences of integers. The process is shown in Figure 3 001\002\001\002 is the identifier of the concept or sub-concept. And the set C 1 C 2  C n are mapped to a set {1, 2 n Through this process the concept C i in the {C 1 C 2  C n is corresponding with the identifier i Step 2: Filtering proposals according to this dictionary. As long as a word is included in this dictionary, it will be retained and replaced by its

identifier. Otherwise, it will be filtered out of the proposals. Considering the concept may be the substring of its sub-concept in Chinese since the subconcept can reveal more sp ecific information about the article, sub-concepts should be retained rather than their substrings. An encoding algorithm is designed to encode the proposal, as shown in Table 1. After this processing, the proposals are transformed into sequences of integers and you can find out identifier of any concept or sub-concept in the dictionary. And  we call these proposals coded proposals after this process Table1 The encoding algorithm where n      number of concepts p     number of proposals m n u m b e r o f ch in ese w o rd s in  th e After proposals are enco ded and compacted, a proposal can be represented by a sequence [n 1 n 2 n  h ich w e  call coded proposal, where m denotes the length of the compacted  proposal The purpose of selecting frequent itemsets is finding some word sequences in certain specific other can show more accurate and more tightly logical link among proposals that have them in common And we will use six steps to extract different frequent word sequences from these proposals including selecting frequent 2-word itemset building the generalized suffix tree \(GST extracting the Itemset in an assigned sequence length picking out Itemset with assigned minimal support transforming each proposal into a vector, and building matrix with different assigned length and assigned minimal support. The details of each step are as follows Step 1: Selecting frequent 2-word itemsets Association rule miner is used to find out the 2-word sequences which satisfy the minimal support. The minimal support means that the minimal number of proposals which selected 2-word sequences should exist in. In this step, fi rstly we extract all 2-word sequences in all proposals. Then pick out these 2-word sequences that satisfy assi gned minimal support \(we call it basic minimal support to form the frequent 2word itemset and collect all words in the frequent 2word itemsetas a dictionary and remove words outside this dictionary from all proposals. The process is shown in Figure 4 001\002\001\002 represent different Chinese words in the proposal Every subsequences of proposal is used to build the GST, shown as the Figure 5. For example, in this example, subsequences are  So every tree is corresponding with one proposal, all information about a proposal is stored in the corresponding tree 000U\000R\000R\000W 000D 000E 000F 000E 000F 000D 000E 000F 000\006 000E 000F 000E 000F 000D 000E 000F 000\006 000F 000E 000F 000D 000E 000F 000\006 000D 000E 000F 000\006 000D 000E 000F 000\006 000\006 000\006 000\006 000\006

corresponds with one proposal, we traverse every generalized suffix tree and collect all subsequences with the assigned length in this tree. For example, in the Figure 5, we can try to extract all word sequences composed by 3 words And from the GST we can get node whose depth equals to 3 And the subsequences corresponding with them are abc, bcb bca, cbc, cab By this means, we can extract all subsequences with the assigned length in one proposal These sequences in a propos al are collected together to form word-sequence set i where indicates that set is corresponding the tree i and proposal Then we merge all sets to form itemset with assigned length. But there may be the same word subsequences in different GSTs So we remove redundant word sequences from the itemset with assigned length Step 4: Picking out itemset with assigned minimal support Use the association rule miner again and pick out word sequences with assigned minimal support from itemset with assigned length to form itemset with assigned length Step 5: Transforming each proposal into a vector In this process, every proposal is transformed into a vector. And every dimension in the vector is the frequency of a word sequence in the itemset with assigned length in the corresponding proposal. So when different itemset with assigned length is given the proposals can be represented by different vectors We call the specific meaning of a dimension vector pattern which corresponds with Itemset with different assigned length. Proposals are transformed to vectors To get the frequency of every element in itemset with assigned length in a proposal, we traverse the corresponding GST that we have built. If the subsequence doesn t exist in one GST, its frequency is 0. And if the subsequence exists in one GST, its frequency in the corresponding proposal equates the leaves belonging to the node corresponding with the last word in the subsequence. For example, in a suffix in Figure 5, if we want to get the frequency of sequence bc we traverse the tree along the sequence and the last word c has three leaves. So we can know that the frequency of sequence ab in this proposal is 3 So we traverse each GST again and get all vectors Then we put all row vectors together to form a Matrix which can represent the entire corpus which need be clustered The Step 3, Step 4 and Step 5 are shown in the Figure 6 001\002\001\002 S where denotes the length of frequent word sequences and denotes the minimal support of frequent word sequences. By changing and S, we can get various Matrix S We use K-means algorithm to cluster proposals. So every Matrix S\ be used to cluster proposals And we can Euclidean Distance of two proposals to indicate the similarity of two proposals So the problem becomes into a multi-criteria decision process [24-25 B ased on ever y Matri x  w e  can calculate Euclidean Distance among them and our criterion is minimizing the Distance within a cluster and maximizing the distance between two clusters Since we have several Matrixes, we have several criteria The remaining problem is how to combine these criteria. Firstly, we define a new distance. The new distance is a combination of several Euclidean Distances calculated according to a several different Matrixes Suppose we have 4 different Matrix, where L equates 2, 3, 4, 5, we have 4 Euclidean Distance. The new distance is the sum of 4 Euclidean Distances with different weights. The expression is as follows 1 where denotes different weights for different Euclidean Distance. And with this new distance, we propose an improved K-means algorithm We replace the Euclidean Distance by the New distance and use the sa me iterating algorithm, and shown in Table 2. Through this means, we combine these different criteria

To determine the appropriate parameters in Matrix  S\ow many Matrixes to be used in the new distance, several experiments are conducted. The corpus that we use consists of 750 proposals in 4 different topics and in our experiment the basic minimal support is set as 50 And we will evaluate the clustering result with measure measure is the typical criterion for measuring the quality of text clustering [12 For  predefined research topic t an d cluster c, the Precision and Recall are defined as follows 2 3 where be the number of research proposals in both topic t and cluster c be the number of proposal in topic c, and be the number of proposal in cluster c The measurement can be expressed as 4 where  In the subsection the weights are set as follows 5 Thus, when K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster research proposals, the new distance is equal to Euclidean Distances based on one single Matrix S And we change the and in Matrix S\k out the clustering performance. We set from 2 to 5 and for every fixed we change S j from 5 to 100. \(S j should be adjusted according to the size of proposal In our experiment, we find that with the increase of  the performance of clustering deteriorates sharply \(see Table 3 and Figure 7 Table3 The performance of single frequent itemset the average value of F-measure can achieve the highest accuracy. However, when no matter what s is chosen, F measure is low than 0.5. So conduct any experiments with longer frequent itemset Furthermore, with the increase of the length of frequent itemset, the performance decreases. Meanwhile, with the increase of support degree, the performance increases first, and then decreases. Figure 8 shows the best performance of different

and the optimal clustering result can be achieved Furthermore, with the increase of the length of frequent itemset, the performance decreases In this subsection weighted Matrixes with different weights are considered. As typical situations, we choose Matrix \(L, S\where is corresponding with the best-performance situation in the above experiment So we set  We select different weights in our experiments Firstly, we give equal weights and check out the result And then, we enhance the weight of Matrix \(2, 40 see the variation in F measure When the several sectors are given equal weights the comprehensive vectors show a poor clustering performance. But with the enhancement of the weight of Matrix \(2, 40\ the measure rises sharply \(see Table 4 and Figure 9 Table 4 The performance of weighted frequent itemsets In this subsection to show the advantage of our proposed method, our proposed method \(\(OFIM compared with the traditional method \(OTTM\Two methods are carried out using the same corpus and the same clustering algorithm \(K-means\he results can be shown in Table 5 Table 5 The performance of ARIMA model Methods OFITTM OTMM F-measure 0.884 0.808 As can be seen from Table 4, the results show that the measure has an obvious rise, comparing with OTMM. Therefore, our proposed method OFIM, is an efficient and effective method to group research proposals in one specific discipline with high-quality performance This paper proposed a novel frequent itemset method for research proposal grouping. In the proposed method, research proposals are firstly coded and compacted, and then frequent itemsets are constructed. Finally, a new clustering algorithm is developed to cluster research proposals. In terms of evaluation criteria, the empirical results revealed that among Matrix with different length and support degrees the proposed method with Matrix \(2, 40 outperforms others. We also find that with the increase of the length of frequent itemset, the performance decreases. Meanwhile, with the increase of support

degree, the performance increases first, and then decreases. Furthermore, compared with OTMM, our proposed method can get better performance. So, it indicates that the proposed frequent itemset method can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the research proposal grouping process, and the proposed method can be used as a potential alternative to cluster research proposals In addition, this study also has some research questions for future studies. Firstly, to validate our proposed method, some additional experiments can be done using different dataset from other disciplines, and different number of research proposals in one discipline. Second, when research proposals are grouped, expert evaluation can be carried out to find proper match between reviewers and proposal groups and then reviewer assignment can also be considered Thirdly, when dealing with the proposal grouping problem, the document struct ure characters of research proposals may also be considered, such as title abstract and references, to improve the grouping quality Finally, the proposed methodology can also be applied to other research fields, especially to text clustering problem The authors would like to thank the minitrack chair and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions which have helped immensely in improving the quality of the paper.

VIII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we tackled the problem of pattern explosion when mining frequent episodes in an event sequence In such a setting much of the output is redundant as many episodes have the same frequency as some other more speciìc episodes We therefore output only closed episodes for which this is not the case Further redundancy is found in the fact that some episodes can be represented in more than one way We solve this problem by restricting ourselves to strict transitively closed episodes Deìning frequency-closed episodes created new problems as unlike in some other settings a non-closed frequent episode can have more than one closure To solve this we deìned instance-closed episodes and showed that the instance-closure of any given episode is unique We further proved that every f closed episode must also be i closed Based on this we developed an algorithm that efìciently identiìes i closed episodes as well as f closed episodes in a post-processing step Experiments have conìrmed that the reduction in output is considerable and essential for large episodes where we reduced the output by several orders of magnitude Moreover thanks to introducing i closed episodes we can now produce output for thresholds at which nding all frequent episodes is infeasible A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is funded by a FWO postdoctoral mandate R EFERENCES  H

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
