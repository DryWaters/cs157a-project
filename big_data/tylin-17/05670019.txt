PERFICT  Perturbed Frequent Itemset based Classiﬁcation Technique Raghvendra Mall Prakhar Jain and Vikram Pudi IIIT Hyderabad India  raghvendramall@students prakharjain@students vikram  iiit.ac.in Abstract This paper presents Perturbed Frequent Itemset based Classiìcation Technique PERFICT a novel associative classiìcation approach based on perturbed frequent itemsets Most of the existing associative classiìers work well on transactional data where each record contains a set of boolean items 
They are not very eective in general for relational data that typically contains real valued attributes In PERFICT we handle real attributes by treating items as attribute,value pairs where the value is not the original one but is perturbed by a small amount and is a range based value We also propose our own similarity measure which captures the nature of real valued attributes and provide eective weights for the itemsets The probabilistic contributions of dierent itemsets is taken into considerations during classiìcation Some of the applications where such a technique is useful are in signal classiìcation medical 
diagnosis and handwriting recognition Experiments conducted on the UCI Repository datasets show that PERFICT is highly competitive in terms of accuracy in comparison with popular associative classiìcation methods I Introduction Starting with the seminal work over a decade ago in sev e ral a sso ciativ e c lassiìcation approac hes ha v e emerged Advantages of these approaches include 1 Frequent itemsets capture all dominant relationships between items in a dataset 2 Ecient itemset mining algorithms exist resulting in highly scalable classiìers 3 These classiìers naturally handle missing values and 
outliers as they only deal with statistically signiìcant associations This property translates well into robustness 4 Extensive experimental studies show that these techniques are less error prone Most of the recent associative classiìers such as CBA CMAR 2 MCAR 3 CP AR 4 GAR C 5 etc work well on transactional data where each record contains a set of boolean items There remains scope for more ecient handling of continuous attributes Moreover in these algorithms an overhead of rule weighting and selection of n best rules is required for classiìcation purposes 
In this paper a novel associative classiìcation procedure namely PERturbed Frequent Itemsets based Classiìcation Technique PERFICT has been proposed Our algorithm explicitly and eectively handles real valued attributes by means of Perturbed Frequent Itemsets PFI A new MJ similarity measure is proposed which regulates the selection of the PFIs The introduction of the similarity measure helps weighing of the PFIs during classiìcation Rule selection process is not required and the pruned PFIs are used for probabilistic estimate of classes We propose 3 methods 1 A naive histogram based approach Hist PER

 Introduction of a new MJ similarity measure for weighing and pruning itemsets  Use of self-adjusting mincount value for pruning perturbed frequent itemsets  Identifying drawbacks of standard discretization method and avoiding it through a preprocessing step II Related Work Recent state of the art has exploited the paradigm of associative rule mining for solving the problem of classiìcation However these associative classiìers suer 
certain drawbacks Though they provide more rules and information redundancy involved in the rules increases the cost in terms of orders of time and computation complexity during the process of classiìcation MCAR determines a redundant rule by checking whether it covers instances in training data set or not GARC brought in the notion of compact set to shrink the rule set by converting the rule set to a compact one Since the reduction of redundant rules require a brute force technique it fails to avoid some meaningless searching

Second as we know the rule generation is based on frequent pattern mining in associative classiìcation when the size of data set grows the time cost for frequent pattern mining may increase sharply which may be an inherent limitation of associative classiìcation These algorithms have a major drawback generation of rules by exact matches irrespective of categorical or numeric attributes This situation causes a problem in most of the real world scenarios because records that contain nearly similar values for a real valued attribute should support the same rule Due to discretized matches the algorithms do not always generate the required rule Approaches like 7 8 9 p e rform numeric attribute based optimized rule mining But its dicult to handle noisy data with them They use computational geometry to determine the areas of conìdence and use it as the primary criteria But similarity of the generated rules with the test record is not emphasized and thus a new similarity measure is required III Basic Concepts and Definitions Without loss of generality we assume our input data to be a relational table with attributes  A 1 A 2 A 3 A n C   where C is the class attribute We use the term item to refer to an attribute value pair  A i a i  where a i is the value of an attribute A i which is not a class attribute For brevity we also simply use a i to refer to the item  A i a i  Each record in the input relational table then contains a set of items I   a 1 a 2 a 3 a n   An itemset T is deìned as T  I A frequent itemset is an itemset whose support i.e frequency is greater than a user-speciìed minimum support threshold We allow for dierent thresholds depending on the length of itemsets to account for the fact that itemsets which have larger length naturally have low supports Let Min k denote the minimum support where k is the length of the corresponding itemset Use of frequent itemsets for numeric real-world data is not appropriate as exact matches for attribute values might not exist Instead we use the notion of perturbation a term used to convey the disturbance of a value from its mean position Perturbation represents the noise in the value of attributes of the items and eectively converts items to ranges For instance given an itemset T with attribute values a v 1  a v 2 and a v 3  the perturbed frequent itemset PFI T will look like PFI T   a v 1   1 a v 2   2 a v 3   3  1 IV The PERFICT Algorithms The PERFICT algorithms are based on the principle of weighted probabilistic contribution of the Perturbed Frequent Itemsets One advantage of this procedure over other associative classiìers is that there is no rule generating step in PERFICT algorithms The basic Figure 1 Hist PERFICT Figure 2 HistSimilar PERFICT concept employed is Records that share the same PFIs are similar and those that share longer PFIs are more similar Here we outline the general structure of the three PERFICT algorithms From Figure 1Ö3 we observe that there are several common steps in the three procedures We rst explain all the steps taking Hist PERFICT in detail and subsequently explain other steps in HistSimilar PERFICT and Randomized K-Means PERFICT A Preprocessing Techniques For associative classiìers it has been observed that there is need of preprocessing step where real valued attributes are discretized In our approach the concept of perturbation appropriately assigns ranges to these attribute values eliminating the need for discretization 1 Histogram Construction A histogram is a frequency chart with non-overlapping adjacent intervals calculated upon values of some variable There are several kinds of histograms but two types of histograms were best suited for our approach They are equi-width histogram and equi-depth histogram Equi-width histograms have all partitions of same size Equi-depth histograms are based on the concept of equal frequency or equal number of values in each partition Equi-depth histograms are more suited for classiìcation because they capture the intrinsic nature of the random variable or attribute being observed Moreover the histogram is not aected by the presence of outliers

Figure 3 K-Means PERFICT An Equi-width histogram on the other hand is highly aected by outliers and is a weak choice for the purpose of classiìcation There exists an approach in whic h p artitions the values of quantitative attributes into equi-depth intervals The underlying principle is that of partial completeness This approach measures the information loss due to formation of rules obtained by considering ranges over partitions of quantitative attributes However the proposed approach works dierently and prevents any information loss B Transforming the Training Data Set From Figure 1 it can be seen that the PERFICT algorithms includes transforming the training dataset Equi-depth histograms are constructed for each attribute with variable depth value The standard deviation of each such partition is computed as well Let us assume there are k attributes apart from the class attribute in the training set In order to convert the attribute value pair a i to a i   i we need a transformation To obtain these ranges we use the histogram constructed above Each attribute value of a training record is mapped to the corresponding histogram bin using a range query from the hash table of histograms The attribute value is transformed to original value  the standard deviation of all the values in mapped bin The perturbation is deìned as the standard deviation of all the attribute values that are initially hashed into that partition Let a ik represent the value of i th attribute corresponding to k th record The histogram bins for the i th attribute are represented as h i 1 h i 2 h i 3 h ip  As we are using equidepth histograms so each partition has same number of values say n Let a ik maps to h i 3  h i 3  hash  a ik  2  h i 3  n  j 1 a ij  n 3  i 3      n  j 1  a ij   h i 3  2 4 a ik  a ik   i 3 5 where  h i 3 represents the mean value for the histogram bin h i 3 and  i 3 represents its standard deviation Table I Dataset before transformation S No A#1 A#2 A#3 Class 1 v 11 v 12 v 13 C 1 2 v 21 v 22 v 23 C 2 3 v 31 v 32 v 33 C 1 Table I I Same Dataset after transformation S No A#1 A#2 A#3 Class 1 v 11   11 v 12   12 v 13   13 C 1 2 v 21   21 v 22   22 v 23   23 C 2 3 v 31   31 v 32   32 v 33   33 C 1 It can be observed from Table 2 that each attribute value is replaced by a perturbed range 1 Issues with discretization Earlier approaches followed a simple discretization step for converting real valued attributes to ranges and mapped these ranges to consecutive integers There are several issues with discretization If the bin size is kept small the number of partitions become very high and the ranges obtained would not capture the nature of the dataset eectively Alternatively if the bin size is large two values of the same attribute positioned at the opposite extremes of the same partition are treated as same though they might have dierent contributions The introduction of perturbation allows two dierent values of the same attribute belonging to the same partition to be mapped to dierent ranges For example consider a histogram interval 0  3 say for attribute A 1 and standard deviation of 0  25 Consider two values belonging to this partition say 0  5 and 2  5 Let the attribute value for the test record be 0  7 A simple discretization process will map 0  5 2  5 and 0  7tothe interval 0  3 and replace these values with an integer say 1 In other words both 0  5 and 2  5 are considered to be equally similar with the test recordês value\(0  7 But by perturbation mechanism we see that similarity of 0  5  0  25 here perturbation  0  25 is greater than 2  5  0  25 as its range is closer and intersecting to the test recordês range\(0  7  0  25

C Transforming the Test Record The same transformation as for training dataset is applied to test records using training data histograms D Generating Perturbed Frequent Itemsets To obtain PFIs we apply the modiìed Apriori algorithm mentioned below Algorithm 1 Generate 2-itemset 2 Repeat till n-itemset\(where n is the number of predictor attributes a Join Step b Prune Step c Record Track Step d forall candidates C i,j   if count C i,j   minsupport Freq  itemset  Freq itemset  C i,j Generating 2-itemset 1 forall training records r  a foreach pair of attributes a i and a j   if test recordês range a i   r s range a i     and test recordês range a j   r s range a j     Candidate i,j  Candidate i,j  r 2 forall candidates C i,j  a if count C i,j   minsupport Freq itemset  Freq itemset  C i,j The Join Step 1 forall pairs L1,L2 of Freq itemset k  1  a if L 1 a 1  L 2 a 1 and L 1 a 2  L 2 a 2  L 1 a k  2  L 2 a k  2 and L 1 a k  1 L 2 a k  1  C k  a 1  a 2  a k  2  L 1 a k  1  L 2 a k  1 The Prune Step 1 forall itemsets c  C k  a foreach k 1 subsets s of c   if s   L k  1 delete c from C k Record Track Step 1 forall itemsets c  C k  a foreach k-1 s of c   foreach record r contributing in count of s Increment count r y1 b forall records r   if count r  k Keep track of record r While developing the algorithm we assume that the minimum contributing PFIs are perturbed frequent 2itemsets To obtain these itemsets we identify all attributes in the training dataset whose value ranges intersect with the test record value ranges Let there be k predictor attributes for training dataset along with the class attribute The i th attribute is denoted by A i So the candidate set is a combination of all possible two itemsets and has the cardinality k C 2  This set can be represented as C 2    A 1 A 2    A 2 A 3     A k  1 A k   where C 2 refers to length 2 candidate itemset A candidate itemset is formed if the range of each attribute of the training record intersects with the corresponding range of the test record For instance let the two attributes be A 0 and A 1 and their values for the j th training record be a j 0   j 0 and a j 1   j 1 respectively From Figure 4 we can conclude that for both attribute A 0 and A 1 the ranged based values of the test record and the training record are intersecting Hence the count for the candidate itemset  A 0 A 1 s incremented by 1 and a track of the training recordid is kept A single training record may account for multiple candidate itemsets and contributes distinctly in the frequency of each such candidate itemset Once the candidate itemsets have been constructed we introduce a small prune step based on the minsupport threshold criteria which is applied on the count for each candidate itemset This mincount is deìned as minsupport 100  size  Currentdataset  The minsupport is directly proportional to degree of pruning For a very high minsupport value very few candidate itemsets will survive A very low minsupport value limiting to 0 results in no pruning Importantly the self-adjusting mincount prevents over tting The size of the Currentdataset is also variable in our procedure For 2-itemsets the value of Currentdataset is initialized to the size of training dataset But for generating frequent itemsets of length  2 only distinct records which contribute towards the count of at least one perturbed frequent itemset are included in Currentdataset  A book-keeping strategy for all the record ids contributing in the frequency of each PFI is followed which is highlighted in the record track step There are some records which do not contribute towards any PFI and are removed Therefore the value of Currentdataset does not remain same As the length of itemset increases for example  A 0 A 1    A 0 A 1 A 2  i.e from 2 itemsets to 3 itemsets the size of Currentdataset decreases The value of mincount adjusts accordingly and reduces The rst iteration to calculate frequent 2-itemsets is the one involving major computation The Join Step The join step is similar to the join step observed in the Apriori algorithm Consider a candidate itemset of length r  C r 1   A 1 A 2 A r  2 P,Q   Then C r  1 i   A 1 A 2  A r  2 P  and C r  1 j   A 1 A 2 A r  2 Q  are frequent itemsets of length r  1 A Frequent itemset of length r  1 implies that r  1 predictor attributes obtained from the training records are intersecting with the respective attributes of the test record While forming candidate itemsets of length r we

Figure 4 All possible range intersection cases take any two frequent itemsets of length r  1having exactly r  2 overlapping attributes in common The possibilities of intersection for individual attribute values are shown in Figure 4 The two r  1 length frequent itemsets contain a number of records with the same ids mapped to them which percolate to the count of the candidate itemset C r 1  Let us illustrate Consider the candidate itemset C  A 0 A 1 A 2  It can be easily visualized to be formed from frequent itemsets  A 0 A 1  and  A 0 A 2  Here A 0 is common to both frequent 2-itemsets The frequency of C is determined by records which are present in both the frequent itemsets The Prune Step After obtaining the candidate itemsets from the above procedure we apply a prune step similar to Apriori The Record Track Step There is a need to keep track of the records which contribute toward any frequent itemset because all such records form the Currentdataset for the next iteration i.e itemset length r-1 to r From the pseudo code it can be observed that for the participation of a record in the count of frequent itemset the record must be contributing in the frequency of each of the subsets of the frequent itemsets For example let us consider a record r participating for frequent itemset  A 0 A 1 A 2  Then r id   A 0 A 1  map r id   A 0 A 2  map and r id   A 1 A 2  map where  A i A j  map represents the map between a frequent itemset and set of all the record ids contributing for that itemset E Naive Probabilistic Estimation Once we have obtained all possible frequent itemsets the nal task is the estimation of the class to which the test record belongs We devise a formula with two components 1 For each frequent itemsets PFIs of length i  2 we keep track of all the records contributing to its count These records may belong to dierent classes For instance let  A 0 A 1 ethe I th PFI of length 2 Let n I be the number of records participating in the count of this PFI Then n I   j  C n Ij C j where C j represents j th class out of the possible C classes So contribution of each PFI of length  2 is deìned as Contri  PFI Ii   I  Freq  i   j  C n Ij  N i C j 6 where N i is the size of dataset for itemsets of length iand PFI Ii represents the I th PFI of length i 2 The second part is the heuristics based rank associated with each PFI We assign dierent ranks to itemsets of dierent lengths However same weight is associated with the itemsets of similar length The allocation resembles ones intuition Greater the length of the PFI more is the similarity between training set and test-record and hence better classiìcation Rank i   i p 1 p  max k 2 max  k 1 7 where the numerator is sum of all natural numbers from 1 to the length i and the denominator is a normalization constant Here max represents the maximum number of attributes in the dataset apart from class attribute as the largest PFI can be of max length only The formula is similar to that used for assigning weights in k-nearest neighbor classiìcation Equation 7 is similar to the Laplacian operator mentioned in It con v erges t o 1 a s t he length of PFIs increases This conforms with the true nature of the problem as records which are highly similar to a given test record are fewer in number and play a major role in predicting its class The overall formula for nding the class conditional probability of a record becomes P  C/R  max  i 2 Contri  PFI Ii   Rank i 8 where P\(C/R contains the contribution from all classes and can also be written as P  C/R  a 1 C 1  a 2 C 2    a t C t 9 where a i represents the contribution of all PFIs for class C i and i varies from 1 to t  This sum of co-ecients a i can be either greater than or less than 1 and is given by S  So to normalize each co-ecient is divided by S  This process converts the ratio into a probability measure We select that class label as the class for the test record whose co-ecient is maximum i.e argmax i  a 1 a 2  a t   This technique is used for Hist PERFICT The importance of the result lies in the fact that a probabilistic estimation of contribution of all the classes pertaining to a single test record is available at the end

This can be viewed as an addendum for detailed analysis and conìdence towards classiìcation.We now provide some of the problems with Hist PERFICT and the way their rectiìcation leads to HistSimilar PERFICT method V Issues with Hist PERFICT A Pruning The number of itemsets generated by the Apriori algorithm are huge and require a pruning step In the case of Hist PERFICT we generate all possible PFIs without including an extra pruning step However some of the itemsets have high contribution in more than one class which sometimes leads to misclassiìcation So we need a pruning step to make the classiìer more eective B Weights As mentioned earlier the rank or weight for dierent length itemsets are dierent However another major issue with the Hist PERFICT approach is that we assign same rank or weights to PFIs of similar length This sometimes degrades the accuracy of classiìcation as is evident by the Precision Table Table 3 We need to construct a metric which can capture the range based nature of the PFIs eectively and provide weights in accordance Both these problems are resolved by the means of our proposed MJ similarity metric VI HistSimilar PERFICT From Figures 1 and 2 we observe that an additional step involving a new similarity calculation is required The criteria is presented as follows A MJ Similarity Metric We deìne a new similarity measure based on the simple though eective notion of area of overlap Let us illustrate by an example Let us assume for a given test record 1 st attribute value a 1 0  5 and 2 nd attribute value a 2 0  6 Then during the transformation of the test record to perturbed range based values we map a 1 to a histogram whose standard deviation is 0.3 and a 2 to a histogram whose standard deviation is 0  4 So the perturbed value for attribute 1 and 2 becomes a 1   1 and a 2   2  Now let there be a training record r for which r 1 0  5and r 2 0  6 These values also map to the histograms whose deviations are 0.3 and 0.4 respectively Perturbed training record values become r 1   1 and r 2   2 where  i is the standard deviation For the attributes 1 and 2 of the record r AO   a 1   1    r 1   1   2   1   a 2   2    r 2   2  2   2  2 2 10 Figure 5 Sample area of Overlap where AO represents Area of Overlap and the intersection of the range based values for 1 st attribute leads to similarity of 0  5 and the intersection of range based values for 2 nd attribute leads to similarity of 0.7 The similarity values are normalized by taking into account the  value of the respective attribute histograms It can be observed from the formula of area of overlap that only taking into account the dot products of the similarity for each attribute would lead to a decrease in the overall multiplying one fraction with another fraction So we introduce an additional multiplicative factor to obtain the overall area of overlap which is dependent on length of the itemset and is deìned as  itemsetlength   itemsetlength   Figure 5 represents the example stated above as an illustration The formula for Area of Overlap can be generalized for the j th PFI of length k  AO PFI jk  k  i 1  a i   i    r i   i   i  k k 11 where a i is the i th attribute value for test record and r i is the i th attribute value for a training record r and  i is deviation of the histogram partition to which the value maps An important constraint imposed on the proposed similarity measure is that PFIs of larger length must be assigned greater weights than PFIs of smaller length But sometimes if we directly use the AO based formula this constrain can be violated Without loss of generality let us consider we have a PFI of length 2  A 1 A 2  and from that PFI another frequent itemset of length 3 A 1 A 2 A 3  is obtained However if the intersection for the 3 rd attribute is very small then Area of Overlap is reduced and so similarity of 3 length PFI can be smaller than that of 2-length PFI In order to prevent such an opposing situation we add a term 2  itemset length to Area of Overlap after taking logarithm base 10 of the Area of Overlap We place the constraint

hour after the min_sup becomes smaller than 0.4. However the MPFCI algorithm can find all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets efficiently. This explains that the computational cost of directly testing frequent closed probability increases sharply with the increase of the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets \(The number increases w.r.t the increase of min_sup\milar results can be found in Fig. 5\(b\which also reports comparison of running time in T20I10D30KP40 dataset. Hence, it is inefficien t to directly check frequent closed probabilities of all probabilistic frequent itemsets which can be obtain by existing solution, such as TODIS [22  Next, we focus on the test of effectiveness of different pruning strategies Effect of min_sup in MPFCI We firstly investigated the running time of five compared algorithms w.r.t. the minimum support, min_sup. Fig. 6\(a\ shows the running time of all algorithms while min_sup changes from 0.2 to 0.6 in Mushroom dataset. When min_sup decreases, we observe that the running time of all the algorithms goes up due to the number of probabilistic frequent itemsets increases. However we find that the growth speed of MPFCI is the lowest due to all pruning methods it employed. We also find that MPFCINoCH has the similar running time with that of MPFCI. This indicates that the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound pruning contributes less to reduce the total running time compared to other pruning methods. In addition, MPFCI-NoBound is the slowest algorithm. In particular the running time of MPFCINoBound is larger than 1 hour when min_sup is smaller 0.3 Similar results can be found in Fig. 6\(b\hich reports the running time of all algorithms in T20I10D30KP40  dataset Effect of pfct in MPFCI We continue to test the running time of five compared algorithms with varying the probabilistic frequent closed threshold, pfct in two different b\, we can obverse that MPFCI is always the fastest algorithm. With regards to the change of pfct, the running time of all algorithms remains approximately the same. Thus, in tuple-model uncertain transaction database we can discover that the influence of probabilistic frequent closed threshold will be smaller than that of min_sup to the total running time. Meanwhile, MPFCI is the fastest algorithm and MPFCI-NoBound is still the slowest one, which indicates that the probabilistic bound pruning is more effective than other pruning methods  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 5 Efficiency Comparison between MPFCI and NaÔve  a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 6 Running time w.r.t min_sup    a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 7 Running time w.r.t pfct   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 8 Running time w.r.t 0010   a Mushroom b  T20I10D30KP40  Fig. 9 Running time w.r.t 001  Effect of 000H 000H in MPFCI In this part, we mainly analyse the influence of the relative tolerance error  0010 to the running time in Fig. 8 \(a\\(b\ With the change of 0010 we can observe: 1 four algorithms, MPFCI, MPFCI-NoCH, MPFCI-NoSuper and MPFCI-NoSub, keep a steady running time. 2\e algorithm of MPFCI-NoBound becomes slower clearly when 0010  becomes lower. In addition, the above observations also verify the time complexity analysis of the approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability. Because the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm does not use any probabilistic bound pruning to reduce redundant computation for frequent closed probability, we have to compute closed probabilities of all itemsets which cannot be removed by other pruning methods.  Please note that the time complexity of our approximation algorithm to compute frequent closed probability is 2 4 ln\(2       Ok UTD 000G\000H Moreover, the running time of approximation algorithm will increase 2 1   O 000H with the decreasing of 0010 Thus, the decreasing of 000H causes more influence to the running time of the MPFCI-NoBound

algorithm. Moreover, other four algorithms utilize the probabilistic bounds pruning, so they can avoid redundant computation of frequent closed probabilities Effect of 000G 000G in MPFCI We finally studied the influence of running time from the probabilistic confidence degree parameter 000G in  Fig. 9 \(a\d \(b\We can find the similar effect with the change of 000H Namely, the MPFCI-NoBound algorithm is also affected greatly by the change of 000G By comparing the results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can discover that the influence of 000G on the running time of MPFCINoBound is smaller than the influence of 000H This is because with decreasing of 000G the running time of MPFCI-NoBound about computing frequent closed probability will increase ln\(2   O 000G   B  Compression Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we mainly evaluate the compression quality of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in probabilistic data against that of frequent closed itemsets in exact data. Without loss of gene rality, we test the compression quality under two different di stributions over Mushroom dataset. The first one makes the Mushroom follows Gaussian distribution whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. The second one follows Gaussian distribu tion whose mean is 0.5 and variance is 0.25 \(Namely, the default set of the Mushroom dataset in our experiments\n addition, we keep same default values of pfct=0.8 000H 0.1, and 000G 0.1 as used in the last subsection We compare the number of itemsets of frequent itemsets for short FI\, frequent closed itemsets \(for short FCI probabilistic frequent itemsets \(for short PFI\, and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets \(for short PFCI\he first two kinds of itemsets are produced by FP-growth algorithm orithm 24] f r o m th e exa ct Mushroom dataset. The PFI and PFCI are generated by TODIS algorithm r alg orithm respecti v e l y   Fig. 10 \(a\hows the comparison of the number of above four kinds of itemsets under the uncertain Mushroom dataset whose mean is 0.8 and variance is 0.1. With min_sup decreasing from 0.3 to 0.1, we observe that the ratio between Number of FCI and Number of FI declines sharply Meanwhile, the ratio between Number of PFCI and Number of PFI also declines quickly. That means the probabilistic frequent closed itemsets over uncertain data have the similar compression effect with frequent closed itemsets in exact data Fig. 10 \(b\ also shows the similar compression result However, we also observe that the compression effect of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets in Fig. 10 \(b\is worse than that in Fig. 10 \(a\hat is because Fig. 10 \(b\he smaller mean than Fig. 10 \(a\as the higher variance than Fig. 10 \(a\ The smaller mean and higher variance indicate higher uncertainty, which leads to less number of probabilistic frequent itemsets and probabilistic frequent closed itemsets under same threshold To sum up, above results demonstrate that our definition of probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps the good compression property of frequent closed itemsets in exact data  a  Mean  0.8,  Var=0.1                     \(b  Mean  0.5,  Var=0.25 Fig. 10 Compression Quality  w.r.t min_sup  C  Approximation Quality Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the approximation quality of our mining algorithm since the problem of computing frequent closed probability has been proven as a #P-Hard problem Because approximation effect of our algorithm is determined by the relative tolerance error 0010 and the probabilistic confidence degree parameter  001 we mainly focus on testing the change of the result set w.r.t the change of 0010 and 001 over our default uncertain Mushroom dataset. We denote the set of the final result as FR and the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets as TI. We use precision which equals FR TI FR and recall which equals FR TI TI to measure the approximate effect. Moreover, it is hard to get the set of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets due to #P-hard complexity. Thus, we use the result set when 0010 0.01 and 001 0.01 as true result set Fig. 11 \(a\ows that the change of precision and recall when 0010 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 001 equals 0.1. We observe that the recall keeps s teady, but precision decreases with 0010 increasing. Because the number of sampling in the ApproxFCP algorithm equals 2 42 ln n 000H\000G  the number of sampling will decrease significantly with 0010 increasing. Moreover 001  equals 0.1, probabilistic confidence degree is also fixed. Thus the number of true probabilistic frequent closed itemsets keeps steady and recall also remain stable. Similarly, Fig. 11 \(b shows the case where 001 increases from 0.05 to 0.3 and 0010  equals 0.1. Because 001 only influences the number of sampling on ln 2  000G times, recall is affected slightly and precision also remains stable. To sum up, above results demonstrate that our approximation algorithm has a good approximation quality  a  Varying 0010 b  Varying 001  Fig. 11 Approximation Quality in Mushroom  D  Algorithm Framework Evaluation In this subsection, we evaluate the efficiencies of the depthfirst search-based and breadth-fi rst search-based strategies Fig. 12\(a\hows the running time of two search solutions while min_sup varies from 0.2 to 0.6 and other parameters are

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
