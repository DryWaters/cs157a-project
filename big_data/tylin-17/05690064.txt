An algorithm of Web usage mining based on attributes number set  Cheng-sheng TU, Gang FANG College of Mathematics and Computer Science Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404000, P.R. China cqwztcs@163.com, cqwzjsjfg@163.com  Abstract 227As large session pattern are saved in Web server log aiming at the character that these pages attribute is Boolean quantity, this paper proposes an algorithm of Web usage mining based on attributes number set, which is suitable for mining session pattern containing many visiting pages. The algorithm 
turns session pattern of users into binary, and then uses the way of number descending to generate frequent candidate item sets The algorithm computes support by attributes number set dimensions in order to scan once session pattern of users, and then the efficiency of Web usage mining is efficient improved The experiment indicates that the efficiency is faster and more efficient than presented algorithms Keywords- Web usage mining; session pattern; Web server log number descending; attributes number set I   Web

R  XY   S  UV  R  XZ   S  UW   R  XY Z   S  UV W  S  U  V Figure 6 An interaction between FD and IND gap between the negative and positive borders may be very insightful to explain the behavior of algorithms and may also give some hints to guess the existence of properties associated with anti-monotone predicates In spite of the huge amount of work done for frequent itemset mining we are not aware of such kind of contributions Nevertheless we introduce in the sequel another data mining problem known to be representable as sets where such properties have been clearly identiìed Application to inclusion dependency mining Inclusion dependencies IND are fundamental semantic constraints for relational databases Let r and s be two relations over schemas R and S  and X and Y be sequences of attributes into R and S respectively The IND R  X   S  Y  is true in  r s  if all the values of X in r are also values of Y in s  This notion generalizes foreign keys constraints very popular in practice The underlying data mining problem can be stated as follows Given a database nd all inclusion dependencies satisìed in this database 23 30 24 From 30 the set of IND candidates can be organized in a levelwise manner a given level say k  corresponds to INDs whose arity is equal to k  Moreover a partial order for INDs can be deìned as follows if i and j are two INDs j  i if j can be obtained by performing the same projection on the two sides of i  For example R  AB   S  EF   R  ABC   S  EFG   In this setting the predicate being satisìed in a database is anti-monotone with respect to  30 Consider now the well known inference rule for inclusion dependencies together with functional dependencies  gi v e n i n F igure 6 Intuiti v e ly  consider an inclusion dependency i  R  XAB   S  YEF  where X and Y are attribute sequences and A B E and F are single attributes Suppose that every IND j such that j  i is satisìed and let j 1  R  XA   S  YE  and j 2  R  XB   S  YF  be two of them The more  Y  is large the more Y is likely to determine E or F  In other words i is likely to be satisìed from inference rule of Figure 6 From this result one may logically expect that large INDs should never appear in the negative border even if large INDs exist It implies a potentially large gap between the two borders distribution like for type II datasets for frequent itemsets All our experiments corroborate this hypothesis We tested three synthetic databases built using the chase procedure W e enforced lar ge INDs in their positi v e border  until size 18 For all databases INDs in the negative border were all of size lower than 3 This particular behavior of the positive border of INDs justiìes an algorithm based on the negative border discovery 5 Conclusion and perspectives In this paper we have thoroughly studied datasets for problems related to frequent itemset mining We have shown that the distribution of the negative and positive borders have an important impact on datasets classiìcation and algorithms performances For frequent itemsets mining a new classiìcation of datasets has been proposed This work is a rst step toward a better understanding of the behavior of algorithms with respect to the search space to be discovered This work has two main perspectives The former is to nd out theoretical foundation of bell curves and stability obtained for the distributions in most of our experiments The latter is the design of adaptive algorithms with respect to dataset characteristics i.e changing dynamically their strategy during runtime References

VIII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we tackled the problem of pattern explosion when mining frequent episodes in an event sequence In such a setting much of the output is redundant as many episodes have the same frequency as some other more speciìc episodes We therefore output only closed episodes for which this is not the case Further redundancy is found in the fact that some episodes can be represented in more than one way We solve this problem by restricting ourselves to strict transitively closed episodes Deìning frequency-closed episodes created new problems as unlike in some other settings a non-closed frequent episode can have more than one closure To solve this we deìned instance-closed episodes and showed that the instance-closure of any given episode is unique We further proved that every f closed episode must also be i closed Based on this we developed an algorithm that efìciently identiìes i closed episodes as well as f closed episodes in a post-processing step Experiments have conìrmed that the reduction in output is considerable and essential for large episodes where we reduced the output by several orders of magnitude Moreover thanks to introducing i closed episodes we can now produce output for thresholds at which nding all frequent episodes is infeasible A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is funded by a FWO postdoctoral mandate R EFERENCES  H

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
